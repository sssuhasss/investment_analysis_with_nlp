Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this report in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. OVERVIEW Anadarko met or exceeded its key operational objectives in 2014 . The Company increased sales volumes per day by approximately 8% over 2013 and added 502 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) of proved reserves. The Company ended 2014 with $7.4 billion of cash on hand, full availability of its $5.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in September 2015 ($5.0 billion Facility), and access to credit and capital markets as needed. In January 2015, the Company paid $5.2 billion after the settlement agreement resolving all claims asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding became effective and replaced the $5.0 billion Facility with two new unsecured credit facilities. The Company paid the settlement using cash on hand and borrowings. Management believes that the Company is positioned to continue to satisfy its operational objectives and capital commitments with cash on hand, available borrowing capacity, and cash flows from operations. Mission and Strategy Anadarko mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by developing, acquiring, and exploring for oil and natural-gas resources vital to the world health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission: explore in high-potential, proven basins identify and commercialize resources employ a global business development approach ensure financial discipline and flexibility Exploring in high-potential, proven, and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with growth opportunities. Anadarko exploration success has created value by increasing future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to mitigate risk by monetizing discoveries. Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient and predictable development opportunities that, in turn, positions the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates. Anadarko global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to assist in the discovery and development of world-class resources that are accretive to the Company performance. These resources help form an optimized global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed. A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Company assets, and Anadarko is committed to disciplined investment in its businesses to efficiently manage commodity price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by its global portfolio, while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic growth opportunities. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Significant 2014 operating and financial activities include the following: Overall Anadarko full-year sales volumes averaged 843 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), representing an 8% increase over 2013 .

Sales volumes decreased by 90 MMcf/d in the Rockies primarily due to the sale of the Company Pinedale/Jonah assets in January 2014 and natural production declines in the Powder River basin and Greater Natural Buttes. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes in the Wattenberg field due to increased horizontal drilling. Sales volumes decreased by 67 MMcf/d in the Gulf of Mexico primarily due to natural production declines. Sales volumes for the Southern and Appalachia Region increased by 94 MMcf/d primarily due to infrastructure expansions that allowed the Company to bring wells online in the Marcellus and Eagleford shales, as well as continued horizontal drilling in the liquids-rich East Texas/North Louisiana horizontal development. 2013 vs. 2012 The Company natural-gas sales volumes increased by 157 MMcf/d. Sales volumes increased by 246 MMcf/d in the Southern and Appalachia Region primarily due to horizontal drilling and infrastructure expansions in the Eagleford and Marcellus shales, as well as new wells drilled in the liquids-rich East Texas/North Louisiana horizontal development. Sales volumes decreased by 47 MMcf/d in the Gulf of Mexico primarily due to natural production declines. Sales volumes for the Rockies decreased by 42 MMcf/d primarily due to a natural production decline in the Powder River basin, partially offset by higher sales volumes in the Wattenberg field due to increased horizontal drilling. Natural-Gas Prices 2014 vs. 2013 The average natural-gas price Anadarko received increased primarily due to low industry natural-gas storage levels as a result of colder than average winter temperatures and the associated high residential heating demand in early 2014. In addition, natural-gas prices increased as a result of higher industrial natural-gas demand, reduced natural-gas imports from Canada, and continued strength in exports to Mexico. 2013 vs. 2012 Anadarko average natural-gas price received increased as higher-than-normal residential and commercial demand early in 2013 reduced overall industry natural-gas storage below the previous year record levels. Natural-gas prices were further supported by higher demand in the fourth quarter of 2013, a reduction in natural-gas imports from Canada, and continued strength in exports to Mexico. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2014 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2013 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 74 28 % 58 6 % 55 MBbls/d 203 28 158 6 149 Price per barrel $ 87.99 (9 ) $ 97.02 $ 97.46 International Sales volumes MMBbls 32 (1 )% 33 7 % 31 MBbls/d 89 (1 ) 90 7 84 Price per barrel $ 99.79 (9 ) $ 109.15 (2 ) $ 111.11 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 106 18 % 91 6 % 86 MBbls/d 292 18 248 6 233 Price per barrel $ 91.58 (10 ) $ 101.41 (1 ) $ 102.35 Oil and condensate sales revenues (millions) $ 9,748 6 $ 9,178 5 $ 8,728 _______________________________________________________________________________ MMBbls million barrels Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes 2014 vs. 2013 Anadarko oil and condensate sales volumes increased by 44 MBbls/d.

Impairments of unproved properties decreased by $796 million primarily due to 2012 impairments of $721 million related to Powder River coalbed methane properties primarily as a result of lower natural-gas prices and $124 million related to a Gulf of Mexico natural-gas property that the Company did not expect to develop under the forecasted natural-gas price environment. Dry hole expense increased by $116 million primarily due to unsuccessful drilling activities expensed in 2013 associated with wells in the Gulf of Mexico, Sierra Leone, Kenya, C te d Ivoire, and New Zealand, compared to unsuccessful drilling activities expensed in 2012 associated with wells in Brazil, Sierra Leone, the Gulf of Mexico, Ghana, and C te d Ivoire. Geological and geophysical expense increased by $57 million primarily due to 2013 seismic purchases in Colombia and the Gulf of Mexico. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements millions except percentages 2014 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2013 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 General and administrative $ 1,316 21 % $ 1,090 (13 )% $ 1,246 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 4,550 16 3,927 (1 ) 3,964 Other taxes 1,244 16 1,077 (12 ) 1,224 Impairments 836 5 794 104 389 General and Administrative Expenses (G&A) 2014 vs. 2013 G&A expense increased by $ 226 million primarily due to higher employee-related expenses of $152 million primarily associated with increased headcount and higher bonus plan expense. In addition, G&A expense increased due to higher legal expenses of $38 million primarily related to the third-party reimbursement of legal expenses associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement received in 2013 and legal fees related to Tronox, as well as higher consulting fees of $15 million. 2013 vs. 2012 G&A expense decreased by $156 million due to reduced legal-related expenses of $101 million and lower employee-related expenses of $60 million. The reduced legal-related expenses primarily related to lower 2013 Tronox legal expenses and the 2013 third-party reimbursement of the Company legal expenses associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement. The lower employee-related expenses primarily related to the 2012 expense associated with Unit Appreciation Rights (UARs), partially offset by higher 2013 employee-related expenses associated with operational expansions. The UARs were awarded in prior years to certain officers of the general partner of WES, a consolidated subsidiary of Anadarko, pursuant to the Western Gas Holdings, LLC (WGH) Equity Incentive Plan. This expense related to the change in fair value of the UARs upon the initial public offering (IPO) of WGP. Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization (DD&A) 2014 vs. 2013 DD&A expense increased by $ 623 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in 2014, increased asset retirement costs for wells in the Gulf of Mexico, and increased costs associated with additional gathering and processing facilities. 2013 vs. 2012 DD&A expense decreased by $37 million primarily due to accelerated expense in 2012 associated with the depletion of fields in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by higher sales volumes in 2013. Other Taxes 2014 vs. 2013 Other taxes increased by $ 167 million . Algerian exceptional profits taxes increased by $128 million attributable to higher oil sales volumes and the commencement of NGLs sales in 2014. U.S. onshore ad valorem taxes increased by $85 million attributable to increased activity related to U.S. onshore properties. Chinese windfall profits tax decreased by $47 million resulting from maintenance downtime in the first half of 2014 and the sale of the Company Chinese subsidiary in August 2014. 2013 vs. 2012 Other taxes decreased by $147 million. Algerian exceptional profits taxes decreased by $116 million due to a lower Algeria effective tax rate resulting from the resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute and lower oil prices. Lower sales volumes and oil prices resulted in a $33 million decrease in U.S. production and severance taxes primarily in Alaska. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairments 2014 The Company recognized impairments of $545 million related to certain U.S. onshore oil and gas properties and $276 million related to certain oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico that were impaired primarily due to lower forecasted natural-gas and oil prices. Declines in commodity prices or negative reserves revisions could result in additional impairments in future periods. See Note 5 Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on impairments and Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the risks associated with oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices. 2013 The Company recognized $562 million due to a reduction in estimated future net cash flows and downward revisions of reserves for certain Gulf of Mexico properties resulting from changes to the Company development plans. The Company recognized $142 million for certain U.S. onshore oil and gas properties and $49 million for related midstream assets due to downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the Company development plans. The Company recognized $30 million for certain midstream properties due to a reduction in estimated future cash flows and $11 million related to the Company Venezuelan cost-method investment due to declines in estimated recoverable value. 2012 The Company recognized $363 million related to oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties located in the United States. These impairments included $259 million related to lower natural-gas prices, $79 million related to downward reserves revisions for a Gulf of Mexico property that was near the end of its economic life, and $25 million for a platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The Company recognized impairments of $13 million related to midstream properties and $13 million related to the Company Venezuelan cost-method investment. millions 2014 2013 2012 Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement $ $ 33 $ (1,797 ) Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs 97 15 18 Algeria Exceptional Profits Tax Settlement In March 2012, Anadarko and Sonatrach resolved the exceptional profits tax dispute. The resolution provided for delivery to the Company of oil valued at $1.7 billion and the elimination of $62 million of previously recorded and unpaid transportation charges. The Company recognized a $1.8 billion credit in the Costs and Expenses section of the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2012 to reflect the effect of this agreement for previously recorded expenses. During 2013, the Company revised its estimate of income tax expense related to the elimination of previously recorded and unpaid transportation charges and recognized a $33 million unfavorable adjustment to the settlement, which was offset by an equivalent income tax benefit also recognized in 2013. At December 31, 2013, the Company had collected all of the $1.7 billion associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax receivable. Deepwater Horizon Settlement and Related Costs During 2014, the Company recorded a $90 million expense and contingent liability associated with a civil penalty under the Clean Water Act (CWA) related to the Deepwater Horizon event-related claims. In addition, Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs included legal expenses and related costs associated with the Deepwater Horizon events for 2014, 2013, and 2012. Refer to Note 17 Contingencies Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion and analysis of these events. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other (Income) Expense millions except percentages 2014 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2013 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 Interest Expense Current debt, long-term debt, and other $ 973 3 % $ 949 (1 )% $ 963 Capitalized interest (201 ) 24 (263 ) (19 ) (221 ) Total interest expense $ 772 13 $ 686 (8 ) $ 742 2014 vs. 2013 Anadarko interest expense increased by $86 million primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest of $62 million related to lower construction-in-progress balances for the Mozambique liquefied natural gas project and the completion of certain U.S. pipeline projects in late 2013 and early 2014. In addition, interest expense increased $13 million due to increased long-term debt outstanding during 2014. For additional information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources and Interest-Rate Risk under Item 7A of this Form 10-K. 2013 vs. 2012 Anadarko interest expense decreased by $56 million primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest of $42 million related to higher construction-in-progress balances for long-term capital projects. Additionally, interest expense decreased by $31 million as a result of the repayment of outstanding borrowings during 2012 associated with the $5.0 billion Facility. These decreases were partially offset by $18 million of interest expense for outstanding borrowings primarily related to WES 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022, which were issued during 2012. millions 2014 2013 2012 (Gains) Losses on Derivatives, net (Gains) losses on commodity derivatives, net $ (589 ) $ 141 $ (387 ) (Gains) losses on interest-rate and other derivatives, net 786 (539 ) 61 Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net $ 197 $ (398 ) $ (326 ) (Gains) losses on derivatives, net represents the changes in fair value of the Company derivative instruments as a result of changes in commodity prices and interest rates. Anadarko enters into commodity derivatives to manage the risk of changes in the market prices for its anticipated sales of production. In addition, Anadarko enters into interest-rate swaps to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness to manage exposure to interest-rate changes.

During 2013, the Company accrued costs of $117 million to decommission the facility and related wells. During 2014, the Company recognized a $22 million increase in the estimated decommissioning costs. Anadarko completed decommissioning of the production facility in 2014 and expects to complete decommissioning of the wells in 2015. Also, as a result of a prior acquisition, the Company recognized a restoration liability of $50 million in 2013 with respect to a landfill located in California for which the Company was notified that it is a potentially responsible party. In the second quarter of 2013, the Company reversed the $56 million tax indemnification liability associated with the 2006 sale of the Company Canadian subsidiary. The indemnity was reversed as a result of certain changes to Canadian tax laws. 2013 vs. 2012 During 2013, the Company recognized a decommissioning charge of $117 million and a restoration liability of $50 million, partially offset by the 2013 reversal of the $56 million tax indemnification liability associated with the 2006 sale of the Company Canadian subsidiary. millions 2014 2013 2012 Tronox-related contingent loss $ 4,360 $ 850 $ (250 ) In April 2014, Anadarko and Kerr-McGee Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Kerr-McGee) entered into a settlement agreement for $5.15 billion resolving all claims asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. Anadarko recognized Tronox-related contingent losses of $4.3 billion in 2014, $850 million in 2013, and reversed $250 million in 2012 associated with the Tronox-related contingent loss recognized in 2011. In addition, Anadarko recognized settlement-related interest expense of $60 million during 2014. An aggregate Tronox-related contingent liability of $5.2 billion was included on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2014 . In January 2015, the Company paid $5.2 billion after the settlement agreement became effective. See Note 17 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Tax Expense millions except percentages 2014 2013 2012 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 1,617 $ 1,165 $ 1,120 Effective tax rate 2,994 % 55 % 31 % 2014 The increase from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to net changes in uncertain tax positions related to the settlement agreement associated with the Tronox Adversary Proceeding, changes in other uncertain tax positions, the tax impact from foreign operations, Algerian exceptional profits taxes, and the non-deductible contingent CWA-penalty accrual. For additional information on income tax rates, see Note 18 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In 2013, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $274 million related to the $850 million loss with respect to the Tronox-related contingent liability. In 2014, the Company recognized an additional deferred tax benefit of $316 million related to the additional $4.360 billion loss with respect to the Tronox-related contingent liability. See Note 17 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 2013 The increase from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to the tax impact from foreign operations, non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax, and deferred tax adjustments. 2012 The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to the non-taxable resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute. This amount was partially offset by the tax impact from foreign operations and non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests The Company net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $187 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , $140 million for 2013 , and $54 million for 2012 , was related to public ownership interests in WES and WGP. Public ownership of WES was 55% at December 31, 2014 , 56.4% at December 31, 2013 , and 51.8% at December 31, 2012 . In December 2012, WGP completed its IPO of approximately 20 million common units representing limited partner interests in WGP at a price of $22.00 per common unit. During 2014, Anadarko sold approximately 6 million WGP common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $335 million . Public ownership of WGP was 11.7% at December 31, 2014 , and was 9% at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . See Note 9 Noncontrolling Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OPERATING RESULTS Segment Analysis Adjusted EBITDAX To assess the performance of Anadarko operating segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as income (loss) before income taxes; exploration expense; DD&A; impairments; interest expense; total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives; and certain items not related to the Company normal operations, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. During the periods presented, items not related to the Company normal operations included Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs, Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, Tronox-related contingent loss, and certain other nonoperating items included in other (income) expense, net. The Company definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a GAAP measure, excludes exploration expense as it is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarko financing methods or capital structure. Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash from settlement of commodity derivatives are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX because these (gains) losses are not considered a measure of asset operating performance. Finally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is excluded from the Company measure of Adjusted EBITDAX because it represents earnings that are not attributable to the Company common stockholders. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to stockholders. Adjusted EBITDAX as defined by Anadarko may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Anadarko results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) before income taxes, and consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX by reporting segment. 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Adjusted EBITDAX millions except percentages 2014 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2013 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 54 (97 )% $ 2,106 (41 )% $ 3,565 Exploration expense 1,639 23 1,329 (32 ) 1,946 DD&A 4,550 16 3,927 (1 ) 3,964 Impairments 836 5 794 104 389 Interest expense 772 13 686 (8 ) 742 Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives 578 NM (307 ) (169 ) 443 Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs 97 NM 15 (17 ) 18 Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement (100 ) 33 102 (1,797 ) Tronox-related contingent loss 4,360 NM 850 NM (250 ) Certain other nonoperating items 22 (80 ) 110 NM Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 187 34 140 159 54 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX $ 12,721 35 $ 9,403 5 $ 8,966 Adjusted EBITDAX by segment Oil and gas exploration and production $ 12,505 35 $ 9,238 9 $ 8,500 Midstream 660 30 508 7 474 Marketing (219 ) (75 ) (125 ) (20 ) (104 ) Other and intersegment eliminations (225 ) (3 ) (218 ) NM 96 Oil and Gas Exploration and Production 2014 vs. 2013 The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to net gains on divestitures, higher sales volumes for oil and NGLs, and higher natural-gas prices. These increases were partially offset by lower oil prices, and higher oil and gas transportation expenses and other taxes, which increased as a result of higher sales volumes. 2013 vs. 2012 The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to higher sales volumes for all products and higher natural-gas prices, partially offset by lower oil and NGLs prices and losses on divestitures primarily related to the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyoming. Midstream 2014 vs. 2013 The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to higher gathering and processing revenue associated with higher volumes and increased natural-gas prices, partially offset by higher processing expenses primarily due to increased volumes. 2013 vs. 2012 The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to higher gathering revenue as a result of increased volumes. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Marketing 2014 vs. 2013 The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX resulted from lower marketing margins and higher transportation expenses. 2013 vs. 2012 The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX resulted from higher transportation expenses due to increased third-party volumes and increased demand fees, partially offset by higher margins primarily associated with natural-gas and NGLs sales. Other and Intersegment Eliminations Other and intersegment eliminations consists primarily of corporate costs, income from hard minerals investments and royalties, and net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives. 2014 vs. 2013 The Adjusted EBITDAX in 2014 was relatively flat compared to the prior year. 2013 vs. 2012 The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to a decrease in net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives in 2013, partially offset by 2012 expense associated with the change in the fair value of the general partner UARs in connection with the WGP IPO. The UARs were awarded in prior years to certain officers of the general partner of WES, pursuant to the WGH Equity Incentive Plan. Proved Reserves Anadarko is focused on growth and profitability, and reserves replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability partially depends on commodity prices and the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Reserves growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery, or acquisition of producing properties. For reserves information, see Oil and Gas Properties and Activities Proved Reserves under Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K and the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Anadarko generates cash needed to fund capital expenditures, debt-service obligations, and dividend payments primarily from operating activities, and enters into debt and equity transactions to maintain its desired capital structure and to finance acquisition opportunities. The Company has a variety of funding sources available, including cash on hand, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements that reduce future capital expenditures, commercial paper, and the Company New Credit Facilities. In addition, as of January 2014, an effective registration statement is available to Anadarko covering the sale of up to 40 million WGP common units. These common units were issued to Anadarko in connection with WGP IPO in December 2012. During 2014, the Company sold 6 million WGP common units and at December 31, 2014 , the Company had 34 million units available for sale. During 2014 , the primary source for funding of capital investments was cash flows from operating activities. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. At December 31, 2014 , Anadarko had no scheduled debt maturities during the next year. Anadarko Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons) can be put to the Company in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value, which will be $796 million at the next put date in October 2015. The Zero Coupons are classified as long-term debt on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance these obligations using long-term debt. See Note 12 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Zero Coupons. Anadarko scheduled 2016 debt maturities are $1.8 billion, exclusive of the Zero Coupons. Management believes that the Company liquidity position, asset portfolio, and operating and financial performance provide the necessary financial flexibility to fund the Company current and long-term operations. Tronox Adversary Proceeding Settlement Payment In April 2014, Anadarko and Kerr-McGee entered into a settlement agreement to resolve all claims asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding for $5.15 billion. In addition, the Company agreed to pay interest on the above amount from April 3, 2014, through the payment of the settlement, with an annual interest rate of 1.5% for the first 180 days and 1.5% plus the one-month LIBOR thereafter. In January 2015, the Company paid $5.2 billion after the settlement agreement became effective. See Note 17 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program During 2014, the Company maintained the $5.0 billion Facility maturing in September 2015. Obligations incurred under the $5.0 billion Facility, as well as obligations Anadarko has to lenders or their affiliates pursuant to certain derivative instruments as discussed in Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, were guaranteed by certain of the Company wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and were secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in certain exploration and production assets located in the United States and 65% of the capital stock of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. During 2014, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility. In June 2014, Anadarko entered into a $3.0 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Five-Year Facility), which is expandable to $4.0 billion, and a $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (364-Day Facility). The New Credit Facilities replaced the $5.0 billion Facility upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including the January 2015 settlement payment related to the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. Under the New Credit Facilities, the Company derivative counterparties no longer maintain security interests in any of the Company assets. As a result, the Company may be required from time to time to post collateral of cash or letters of credit based on the negotiated terms of the individual derivative agreements. In January 2015, the Company borrowed $1.5 billion under the 364-Day Facility. Borrowings under the New Credit Facilities generally bear interest under one of two rate options, at Anadarko election, using either LIBOR (or Euro Interbank Offered Rate in the case of borrowings under the Five-Year Facility denominated in Euro) or an alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.65% for the Five-Year Facility and 0.00% to 1.675% for the 364-Day Facility. The applicable margin will vary depending on Anadarko credit ratings. In January 2015, the Company initiated a commercial paper program, which allows a maximum of $3.0 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes. The maturities of the commercial paper notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days. The commercial paper notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued either at a discounted price to their principal face value or will bear interest at varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Such discounted price or interest amounts are dependent on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the commercial paper program by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance of the commercial paper notes. Financial Covenants The $5.0 billion Facility contained various customary covenants with which Anadarko had to comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, liens on assets, and asset sales. Anadarko was also required to maintain, at the end of each quarter, (i) a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 (relative to Consolidated EBITDAX for the most recent period of four calendar quarters), (ii) a ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities of no less than 1.0 to 1.0, and (iii) a Collateral Coverage Ratio of no less than 1.75 to 1.0, in each case, as defined in the $5.0 billion Facility. The Collateral Coverage Ratio was the ratio of an annually redetermined value of pledged assets to outstanding loans under the $5.0 billion Facility. Additionally, to borrow from the $5.0 billion Facility, the Collateral Coverage Ratio had to be no less than 1.75 to 1.0 after giving pro forma effect to the requested borrowing. The covenants contained in certain of the Company credit agreements provide for a maximum Anadarko debt-to-capitalization ratio of 67%. The covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends; however, the impact of dividends paid on the Company debt-to-capitalization ratio must be considered to ensure covenant compliance. At December 31, 2014 , Anadarko was in compliance with all financial covenants. The New Credit Facilities contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65%, and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes. 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements WES Funding Sources Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, uses cash flows from operations to fund ongoing operations (including capital investments in the ordinary course of business), service its debt, and make distributions to its equity holders. As needed, WES supplements cash generated from its operating activities with proceeds from debt or equity issuances or borrowings under its five-year $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF). In February 2014, WES entered into the RCF, which amended and restated its then-existing $800 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The RCF matures in February 2019 and is expandable to a maximum of $1.5 billion. Borrowings under the RCF bear interest at (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.975% to 1.45%, depending on WES credit rating, or (ii) the greatest of (a) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.45%. At December 31, 2014 , WES was in compliance with all covenants contained in its RCF, had outstanding borrowings under its RCF of $510 million at an interest rate of 1.47% , and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $677 million ($1.2 billion capacity, less $510 million of outstanding borrowings and $13 million of outstanding letters of credit). In August 2014, WES filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission authorizing the issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of common units, in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of the offerings. Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarko insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Company insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages. The Company current insurance coverage includes (a) $400 million per occurrence from Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) for physical damage to Anadarko properties on a replacement cost basis, blowout/control of well, redrill, and sudden and accidental pollution; (b) $700 million per occurrence from the commercial markets for the items described in item (a) above, which is in excess of the OIL coverage and which follows the form of OIL coverage with certain exceptions; (c) $400 million from the commercial markets, which scales to Anadarko working interest, for third-party liabilities including sudden and accidental pollution and aviation liability; and (d) $275 million for aircraft liability (in addition to the third-party liability limits described in item (c) above). Anadarko does not carry significant coverage for loss of production income from any of the Company facilities or for any losses that result from the effects of a named windstorm. The Company service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider. 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows for the three-year period ended December 31, 2014 . Forward-looking information related to the Company liquidity and capital resources is discussed in Outlook that follows. Sources of Cash Operating Activities Anadarko cash flows from operating activities in 2014 was $8.5 billion compared to $8.9 billion in 2013 and $8.3 billion in 2012 . Cash flows from operating activities for 2014 decreased year over year due to $730 million of cash received in 2013 associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, a $520 million income tax payment in 2014 associated with the Company divestiture of a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique, lower average oil and NGLs prices, lower natural-gas volumes, higher operating expenses, and the unfavorable impact of changes in working capital items. These decreases were substantially offset by higher average natural-gas prices, higher sales volumes for oil and NGLs, and net cash received in settlement of commodity derivative instruments. Cash flows from operating activities for 2013 increased year over year primarily due to higher sales volumes, higher average natural-gas prices, and the favorable impact of changes in working capital items. These increases were partially offset by lower average oil and NGLs prices and a decrease in cash collected in 2013 associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax receivable. One of the primary sources of variability in the Company cash flows from operating activities is fluctuation in commodity prices, the impact of which Anadarko partially mitigates by entering into commodity derivatives. Sales-volume changes also impact cash flow, but historically have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by the costs related to continued operations and debt service. Investing Activities Anadarko received pretax sales proceeds related to property divestiture transactions of $5.0 billion in 2014 , $567 million in 2013 , and $657 million in 2012 . The increase in 2014 was primarily related to the Company divestitures of a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique for $2.64 billion, its Chinese subsidiary for $1.075 billion, its interest in the Pinedale/Jonah assets in Wyoming for $581 million, and its interest in the nonoperated Vito deepwater development, along with several surrounding exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, for $500 million. Financing Activities During 2014 , Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, borrowed $ 1.2 billion under its RCF primarily to partially fund its acquisitions of DBM and Anadarko interests in Texas Express Pipeline LLC, Texas Express Gathering LLC, and Front Range Pipeline LLC and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. During 2014, WES completed public offerings of $100 million aggregate principal amount of 2.600% Senior Notes due 2018 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.450% Senior Notes due 2044. These proceeds were used to repay borrowings under WES RCF and for general partnership purposes. During 2014, WES issued approximately 10 million common units to the public, raising total net proceeds of $691 million . The proceeds were used to partially fund a portion of its DBM acquisition. WES used all the capacity to issue units under the $125 million continuous offering program as of the end of the third quarter of 2014. During 2014, Anadarko sold approximately 6 million WGP common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $335 million . Also, during 2014 , Anadarko completed public offerings of $625 million aggregate principal amount of 3.450% Senior Notes due 2024 and $625 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Senior Notes due 2044. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. During 2013, WES borrowed $710 million under its RCF, primarily to fund the 2013 acquisitions of an interest in certain gas-gathering systems located in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania and an intrastate pipeline in southwestern Wyoming, and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. During 2013, WES also issued approximately 12 million common units to the public, including the $125 million continuous offering program. These offerings raised net proceeds of $725 million, which were primarily used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes, including funding of WES capital expenditures. Also in 2013, WES completed a public offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.600% Senior Notes due 2018, with net proceeds from the offering used to repay outstanding borrowings under its RCF. 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During 2012, WES borrowed $374 million under its RCF, primarily to fund the acquisition of certain midstream assets from Anadarko. Also during 2012, WES completed a public offering of $670 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 and issued five million common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $212 million. Proceeds from these public offerings were used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. In December 2012, WGP completed its IPO of approximately 20 million common units representing limited partner interests in WGP at a price of $22.00 per common unit, for net proceeds of $411 million. The proceeds were used by WGP to purchase common and general partner units in WES, and were in turn used by WES for general partnership purposes, including the funding of WES capital expenditures. Uses of Cash Anadarko invests significant capital to develop, acquire, and explore for oil and natural-gas resources and to expand its midstream infrastructure. The Company also uses cash to fund ongoing operating costs, capital contributions to equity investments, debt repayments, and distributions to its shareholders. Capital Expenditures The following presents the Company capital expenditures by category: millions 2014 2013 2012 Property acquisitions Exploration $ 283 $ 327 $ 239 Development 3 324 Exploration 1,711 1,970 2,064 Development 6,715 4,865 4,064 Total oil and gas costs incurred (1) 8,712 7,486 6,367 Less corporate acquisitions and non-cash property transactions (1 ) 6 32 Less asset retirement costs 347 180 98 Less geological and geophysical, exploration overhead, delay rentals expenses, and other expenses 543 430 401 Total oil and gas capital expenditures 7,823 6,870 5,836 Gathering, processing, and marketing and other (2) 1,433 1,653 1,475 Total capital expenditures (1) $ 9,256 $ 8,523 $ 7,311 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Costs associated with activities of the Company midstream and marketing reporting segments, LNG facilities costs, and other corporate activities are not included in oil and gas costs incurred. Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions and non-cash property transactions and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and costs incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment and dry hole costs on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments to provide a cash-basis presentation. (2) Includes WES capital expenditures of $696 million in 2014 , $792 million in 2013 , and $529 million in 2012 . The Company capital expenditures increased by 9% for the year ended December 31, 2014 , due to increased development drilling primarily in the Wattenberg field of $663 million and in the Eagleford shale of $546 million and to a spar lease buyout of $110 million in the Gulf of Mexico. The increase in the Eagleford shale was primarily due to the 2013 development drilling being funded by a third party as a result of a carried-interest agreement that was fully funded in June 2013. These 2014 increases were partially offset by 2013 acquisitions of certain oil and gas properties and related assets in the Moxa area of Wyoming for $310 million, primarily representing the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired, and the acquisition of a 33.75% interest in gas-gathering systems located in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania from a third party by WES for $135 million. 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In the third quarter of 2014, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $442 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 34% working interest in the Eaglebine development, located in Southeast Texas. The third-party funding is expected to cover Anadarko future capital costs in the development through 2016. At December 31, 2014 , $22 million of the total $442 million obligation had been funded. The Company capital spending increased by 17% for the year ended December 31, 2013 , due to development drilling onshore and offshore in the United States and acquisitions of oil and gas development properties and domestic onshore plants and gathering systems. In 2013, Anadarko exchanged certain oil and gas properties in the Wattenberg field with a third party to enhance the Company core acreage position, in which $106 million of capital was incurred. Also in 2013, Anadarko acquired certain oil and gas properties and related assets in the Moxa area of Wyoming for $310 million, primarily representing the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired. In 2013, WES acquired a 33.75% interest in gas-gathering systems for $135 million and an intrastate pipeline in southwestern Wyoming for $28 million. These increases were offset by lower capital spending associated with decreased exploration drilling in West Africa and U.S. onshore and lower capital requirements to Anadarko related to development projects as a result of the carried-interest arrangements discussed below. In 2013, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $860 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 12.75% working interest in the Heidelberg development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. The third-party funding is expected to cover the substantial majority of Anadarko expected future capital costs through first production, which is expected to occur by mid-2016. At December 31, 2014 , $386 million of the total $860 million obligation had been funded. In the third quarter of 2012, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that required a third party to fund $556 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 7.2% working interest in the Lucius development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. During the second quarter of 2014, as dictated by the Unitization and Participation Agreement, the working interests of all partners in the Lucius development were recalculated. As a result, Anadarko working interest in the Lucius development was reduced from 27.8% to 23.8% and its capital expenditures were reduced by $44 million due to the re-determination. In addition, the working interest of the third party that participated in the carried-interest arrangement was reduced from 7.2% to 6.2%, which resulted in a reduction in the funding commitment from $556 million to $476 million. The funding commitment, which was fully funded during the second quarter of 2014, covered the substantial majority of the Company capital costs through first production, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. Pension Contributions During 2014 , the Company made contributions of $106 million to its funded pension plans, $15 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $15 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans, which are included in Operating Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Contributions to the funded pension plans decreased in 2014 as a result of favorable asset returns in 2013. Contributions made to the unfunded pension plans in 2014 were lower as a result of higher funding in 2013 related to the retirement of the Company former Chief Executive Officer. The Company expects to contribute $5 million to its funded pension plans, $24 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $16 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans in 2015 . During 2013 , the Company made contributions of $123 million to its funded pension plans, $37 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $14 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. The increase in contributions to the funded pension plans in 2013 resulted from a decrease in the discount rates used for funding purposes. During 2012, the Company made contributions of $101 million to its funded pension plans, $6 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $19 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. The decrease in contributions to the funded pension plans in 2012 resulted from an increase in the discount rates used for funding purposes. 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Investments During 2014 , the Company made capital contributions of $167 million related to equity investments, which are included in Other net under Investing Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. These contributions were primarily associated with joint ventures for a gas processing plant, marine well containment, and pipelines. The Company made capital contributions related to equity investments of $396 million in 2013 , which were primarily associated with joint ventures to build the Front Range Pipeline, the Texas Express Pipeline, and two fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu. The Company made capital contributions related to equity investments of $205 million in 2012 . Debt Retirements and Repayments During 2014 , Anadarko repaid $775 million of Senior Notes that matured during 2014 . Also, WES repaid $650 million of borrowings under its RCF with proceeds from debt and equity offerings, as discussed in Sources of Cash. During 2013 , WES repaid $710 million of borrowings under its RCF with proceeds from debt and equity offerings. During 2012 , the Company repaid the entire $2.5 billion of borrowings under its $5.0 billion Facility, and retired $131 million of 6.125% Senior Notes that matured in March 2012 and $39 million of 5.000% Senior Notes that matured in October 2012. In addition, WES repaid $374 million of borrowings under its RCF. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity, and interest rates, see Note 12 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Common Stock Dividends and Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners Anadarko paid dividends to its common stockholders of $ 505 million in 2014 , $274 million in 2013 , and $181 million in 2012 . The Company increased the quarterly dividend paid to common stockholders from $0.09 per share to $0.18 per share during the third quarter of 2013. During the second quarter of 2014, Anadarko increased the quarterly dividend paid to common stockholders from $0.18 per share to $0.27 per share. Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders quarterly since becoming a public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends paid to Anadarko common stockholders will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements, the effect a dividend payment would have on the Company compliance with relevant financial covenants, and other factors. WES distributed to its unitholders, other than Anadarko, an aggregate of $175 million in 2014 , $130 million in 2013 , and $100 million in 2012 . WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its IPO in the second quarter of 2008 and has increased its distribution from $0.30 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.70 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 (paid in February 2015 ). WGP distributed to its unitholders, other than Anadarko, an aggregate of $24 million during 2014 and $12 million in 2013 . WGP declared a cash distribution of $0.31250 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2014 (to be paid in February 2015 ). 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Outlook Oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices can have significant price fluctuations. The Company revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital spending, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices the Company receives for oil, natural gas, and NGLs. During 2014, New York Mercantile Exchange West Texas Intermediate oil prices ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel to a low of $53.27 per barrel at the end of 2014. The duration and magnitude of the decline in oil prices cannot be predicted. The Company has a deep portfolio of investment opportunities and the financial strength and operational flexibility to move capital spending from areas focused on near-term production growth to areas focused on longer-term growth where anticipated returns are less sensitive to spot oil and natural-gas prices. The recent decline in oil prices may result in the Company significantly reducing its capital expenditures in 2015 versus 2014. The Company will continue to evaluate the oil and natural-gas price environments and may adjust its capital spending plans as prices fluctuate while maintaining the appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility. The Company is committed to the execution of its worldwide exploration, appraisal, and development programs. The Company currently plans to allocate approximately 65% of its 2015 capital spending to development activities, 15% to exploration activities, and 20% to gas-gathering and processing activities and other business activities. The Company currently expects its 2015 capital spending by area to be approximately 55% for the U.S. onshore region and Alaska, 10% for the Gulf of Mexico, 20% for Midstream and other, and 15% for International. Anadarko believes that its cash on hand, available borrowing capacity, and expected level of operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the Company projected operational and capital programs for 2015 and continue to meet its other current obligations. The Company cash on hand is available for use and could be supplemented, as needed, with available borrowing capacity under the New Credit Facilities and the commercial paper program. The Company may also enter into carried-interest arrangements with third parties to fund certain capital expenditures, execute asset divestitures, and sell a portion of the WGP common units that it owns in order to supplement cash flow. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. To reduce commodity-price risk and increase the predictability of 2015 cash flows, Anadarko entered into strategic derivative positions, which cover a portion of its anticipated natural-gas sales volumes for 2015 . For details of derivative positions at December 31, 2014 , see Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance-sheet obligations. The Company material off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. In addition, the Company enters into other contractual agreements in the normal course of business for processing, treating, transportation, and storage of natural gas, oil, and NGLs, as well as for other oil and gas activities as discussed below in Obligations and Commitments . Other than the items discussed above, there are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarko liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations and Commitments The following is a summary of the Company obligations at December 31, 2014 : Obligations by Period (1) millions 2015 2016-2017 2018-2019 2020 and beyond Total Total debt Principal long-term borrowings (2) $ $ 3,750 $ 1,874 $ 11,063 $ 16,687 Principal capital lease obligation 1 20 21 Investee entities debt (3) 2,853 2,853 Interest on borrowings 876 1,647 1,219 7,907 11,649 Interest on capital lease obligations 2 3 3 15 23 Investee entities interest (3) 41 152 199 2,574 2,966 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 939 1,310 460 28 2,737 Production platforms 33 43 43 51 170 Other 50 72 24 8 154 Asset retirement obligations 258 413 180 1,202 2,053 Midstream and marketing activities 930 1,904 1,775 2,656 7,265 Oil and gas activities 1,295 1,059 426 400 3,180 Derivative liabilities (4) 43 1,200 1,243 Uncertain tax positions, interest, and penalties (5) 123 193 5 11 332 Environmental liabilities 20 19 9 78 126 Other 40 222 262 Total $ 4,650 $ 11,987 $ 6,218 $ 28,866 $ 51,721 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) This table does not include the Tronox-related contingent liability, other litigation-related contingent liabilities, or the Company pension and postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 17 Contingencies Tronox Litigation and Note 21 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (2) Includes the fully accreted principal amount of the Zero Coupons of approximately $2.4 billion as coming due after 2019 . While the Zero Coupons do not mature until 2036, the outstanding Zero Coupons can be put to the Company each October, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value . The Company could be required to repurchase the outstanding Zero Coupons at $796 million in October 2015 (the next potential put date). (3) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term liabilities other for all periods presented. These notes payable provide for a variable rate of interest, reset quarterly. Therefore, future interest payments presented in the table above are estimated using the forward LIBOR rate curve. Further, the above table does not reflect the preferred return that Anadarko receives on its investment in these entities, which is also LIBOR-based, but with a lower margin than the margin on the associated notes payable. See Note 10 Equity-Method Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (4) Represents Anadarko gross derivative liability after taking into account the impacts of netting margin and collateral balances deposited with counterparties. See Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (5) See Note 18 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include approximately $2.5 billion related to seven offshore drilling vessels and $208 million related to certain contracts for U.S. onshore drilling rigs. Anadarko manages its access to rigs to support the execution of its drilling strategy over the next several years. Lease payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will initially be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated or impaired in future periods or written off as exploration expense. At December 31, 2014 , the Company had $324 million in various commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors, and aircraft. For additional information, see Note 16 Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to fund the costs of disposing of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarko asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. The Company AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Company credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various processing, transportation, storage, and purchase agreements to access markets and provide flexibility to sell its natural gas, oil, and NGLs in certain areas. Oil and Gas Activities At December 31, 2014 , Anadarko had various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development, and production activities that extend beyond 2014 . The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $3.2 billion , comprised of approximately $2.0 billion related to the United States and $1.2 billion related to international locations. Environmental Liabilities Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. At December 31, 2014 , the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet included a $126 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and ongoing remediation and reclamation activities, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP in the United States requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Company significant accounting policies. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection, development, and disclosure of these estimates is discussed with the Company Audit Committee. Proved Reserves Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of DD&A. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by five percent across all calculations, DD&A in 2014 would have increased by approximately $210 million. Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in future periods. See Note 6 Suspended Exploratory Well Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fair Value The Company estimates fair value for long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing when necessary, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets, and initial measurements of AROs. When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or for a similar asset or liability, the Company uses the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management assumptions. The cost approach is based on management best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. The market approach is based on management best assumptions regarding prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving comparable assets. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, future net cash flows, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. Property Impairments When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset group are compared to the carrying amount of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future net cash flows, based on our estimate of future oil and natural-gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to fair value. Fair value estimates require significant judgment and oil and natural-gas prices are a significant component of the fair-value estimate. Prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and the Company expects that volatility to continue in the future. A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its undiscounted future net cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an asset carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company uses a variety of fair-value measurement techniques as discussed below when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist. Goodwill Impairments The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually at October 1, or more frequently as circumstances dictate. The first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is an optional qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that fair value of the reporting unit more than likely exceeds the related carrying amount, then goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not necessary. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or indicates fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets, including goodwill, and determines whether impairment is necessary. Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests, when such tests are necessary. Management uses all available information to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observable for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, control premiums and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. 80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles used in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Company supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would use based upon the risks inherent in Anadarko operations. Management also includes control premium assumptions based on observable market information regarding how a market participant would value the oil and gas exploration and reporting unit as a whole rather than as individual properties that are part of an oil and gas portfolio. For the Company other gathering and processing, WES gathering and processing, and WES transportation reporting units, the Company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected EBITDA. The Company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for these reporting units. A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include commodity-price declines, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market-based transactions for similar assets, as well as difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits or other unanticipated events. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates when it establishes liabilities for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Estimates of litigation-related liabilities are based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and on information currently available to the Company. The extent of information available varies based on the status of the litigation and the Company evaluation of the claim and legal arguments. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of litigation-related liabilities including discovery activities, briefings filed with the relevant court, rulings from the court in the process or at the conclusion of any trial, and similar cases involving other plaintiffs and defendants that may set or change legal precedent. As events unfold throughout the litigation process, the Company evaluates the available information and may consult with third-party legal counsel to determine whether liability accruals should be established or adjusted. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures that could arise related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consult with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in the evaluation of the Company liability for these contingencies. 81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax-credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets by analyzing the reversal periods of available net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards, temporary differences in tax assets and liabilities, the availability of tax planning strategies, and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Company internal business forecasts. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters.
