Risk Factors. 31 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued A CCOUNTING M ATTERS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Dominion and Virginia Power have identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to their financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion and Virginia Power have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committees of their Boards of Directors. Virginia Power Board of Directors also serves as its Audit Committee. A CCOUNTING FOR R EGULATED O PERATIONS The accounting for Virginia Power regulated electric and Dominion regulated gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that they are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs are deferred as regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator. The Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future rates is probable and make various assumptions in their analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. A SSET R ETIREMENT O BLIGATIONS Dominion and Virginia Power recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the ARO can be reasonably estimated. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, the Companies estimate the fair value of their AROs using present value techniques, in which they make various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When the Companies revise any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, they adjust the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset. The Companies accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, Dominion recognized $77 million, $84 million and $85 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $88 million in 2013. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, Virginia Power recognized $34 million, $36 million and $35 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $38 million in 2013. Virginia Power records accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs as an adjustment to its regulatory liability for nuclear decommissioning. A significant portion of the Companies AROs relates to the future decommissioning of Dominion merchant and Virginia Power utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December 31, 2012, Dominion nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.5 billion, representing approximately 86% of its total AROs. At December 31, 2012, Virginia Power nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $633 million, representing approximately 90% of its total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with the Companies nuclear decommissioning obligations. The Companies obtain from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for their nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, the Companies cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. The Companies determine cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be a critical assumption. In September 2012, Dominion recorded an increase of $246 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. The ARO revision was primarily driven by management decision to cease operations and begin decommissioning Kewaunee in 2013. Virginia Power recorded an increase of $43 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. The ARO revision was driven by an increase in estimated costs. In December 2011, Dominion recorded a decrease of $290 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. Virginia Power recorded a decrease of $95 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. The ARO revision in 2011 was driven by a reduction in anticipated future decommissioning costs due to the expected future recovery from the DOE of certain spent fuel costs based on the Companies contracts with the DOE for disposal of spent nuclear fuel, as well as updated escalation rates. I NCOME T AXES Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. 32 Table of Contents Given the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2012, Dominion had $293 million and Virginia Power had $57 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion and Virginia Power evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. The Companies establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2012, Dominion had established $93 million of valuation allowances and Virginia Power had no valuation allowances. A CCOUNTING FOR D ERIVATIVE C ONTRACTS AND O THER I NSTRUMENTS AT F AIR V ALUE Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative contracts such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage commodity and financial market risks of their business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominion and Virginia Power nuclear decommissioning and Dominion rabbi and benefit plan trust funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 6 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements. Fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, the Companies consider whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases, the Companies must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect their market assumptions. The Companies maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. U SE OF E STIMATES IN G OODWILL I MPAIRMENT T ESTING As of December 31, 2012, Dominion reported $3.1 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000. In April of each year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2012, 2011 and 2010 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment. In general, Dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. For Dominion Appalachian E&P operations and Peoples and Hope operations, negotiated sales prices were used as fair value for the tests conducted in 2010. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. U SE OF E STIMATES IN L ONG -L IVED A SSET I MPAIRMENT T ESTING Impairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about operating the long-lived assets and the 33 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets. E MPLOYEE B ENEFIT P LANS Dominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost trend rates are critical assumptions. Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of: Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; Historical return analysis to determine long term historic returns as well as historic risk premiums for various asset classes; Expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations; Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the expected long-term returns of major stock market indices; and Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 33% fixed income, 3% real estate and 18% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments. Strategic investment policies are established for Dominion prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans strategic allocation are a function of Dominion assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Future asset/ liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns. Dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2012, 2011 and 2010. Dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.75% for 2012, 2011 and 2010. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets. Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost were 5.50% in 2012, 5.90% in 2011 and 6.60% in 2010. Dominion selected a discount rate of 4.40% for determining its December 31, 2012 projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Dominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2012 was 7% and is expected to gradually decrease to 4.60% by 2061 and continue at that rate for years thereafter. The following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant: Increase in Net Periodic Cost Change in Actuarial Assumption Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits (millions, except percentages) Discount rate (0.25 )% $ 17 $ 4 Long-term rate of return on plan assets (0.25 )% 13 3 Healthcare cost trend rate 1 % N/A 17 In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2012, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion projected pension benefit obligation by $219 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $54 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $218 million. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. R EVENUE R ECOGNITION U NBILLED R EVENUE Virginia Power recognizes and records revenues when energy is delivered to the customer. The determination of sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, the amount of electric energy delivered to customers, but not yet billed, is estimated and recorded as unbilled revenue. This estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings. Virginia 34 Table of Contents Power customer receivables included $348 million and $360 million of accrued unbilled revenue at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The calculation of unbilled revenues is complex and includes numerous estimates and assumptions including historical usage, applicable customer rates, weather factors and total daily electric generation supplied, adjusted for line losses. Changes in customer usage patterns and other factors, which are the basis for the estimates of unbilled revenues, could have a significant effect on the calculation and therefore on Virginia Power results of operations and financial condition. D OMINION R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS Presented below is a summary of Dominion consolidated results: Year Ended December 31, 2012 $ Change 2011 $ Change 2010 (millions, except EPS) Net Income attributable to Dominion $ 302 $ (1,106 ) $ 1,408 $ (1,400 ) $ 2,808 Diluted EPS 0.53 (1.92 ) 2.45 (2.31 ) 4.76 Overview 2012 VS . 2011 Net income attributable to Dominion decreased by 79%. Unfavorable drivers include impairment and other charges related to bids received for Brayton Point and Kincaid and management decision to cease operations and begin decommissioning Kewaunee in 2013. Favorable drivers include the absence of an impairment charge related to certain utility coal-fired power stations and the absence of restoration costs associated with damage caused by Hurricane Irene recorded in 2011. 2011 VS . 2010 Net income attributable to Dominion decreased by 50%. Unfavorable drivers include the absence of a gain on the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations, lower margins from merchant generation operations, and the impact of less favorable weather, including Hurricane Irene, on electric utility operations. Favorable drivers include the absence of charges related to a workforce reduction program and the absence of a loss on the sale of Peoples, and higher earnings from rate adjustment clauses. Analysis of Consolidated Operations Presented below are selected amounts related to Dominion results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2012 $ Change 2011 $ Change 2010 (millions) Operating Revenue $ 13,093 $ (1,052 ) $ 14,145 $ (782 ) $ 14,927 Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases 3,748 (349 ) 4,097 63 4,034 Purchased electric capacity 387 (67 ) 454 1 453 Purchased gas 1,177 (587 ) 1,764 (285 ) 2,049 Net Revenue 7,781 (49 ) 7,830 (561 ) 8,391 Other operations and maintenance 4,868 1,546 3,322 (126 ) 3,448 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,186 120 1,066 31 1,035 Other taxes 571 23 548 24 524 Gain on sale of Appalachian E&P operations (2,467 ) 2,467 Other income 223 45 178 8 170 Interest and related charges 882 15 867 41 826 Income tax expense 146 (608 ) 754 (1,358 ) 2,112 Loss from discontinued operations (22 ) 3 (25 ) 233 (258 ) An analysis of Dominion results of operations follows: 2012 VS . 2011 Net Revenue decreased 1%, primarily reflecting: A $161 million decrease from merchant generation operations, primarily reflecting a decrease in realized prices; and A $144 million decrease from regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily reflecting decreased rider revenue ($117 million) related to low income assistance programs. These decreases were partially offset by: A $184 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting: The impact of rate adjustment clauses ($138 million); The absence of a charge recorded in 2011 based on the Biennial Review Order to refund revenues to customers ($81 million); and A decrease in net capacity expenses ($31 million); partially offset by The impact ($58 million) of a decrease in sales to retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in cooling and heating degree days ($184 million), partially offset by an increase in sales due to the effect of favorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($126 million); A $57 million increase in retail energy marketing activities primarily due to price risk management activities; and A $6 million increase from regulated natural gas transmission operations, primarily due to new transportation assets placed in service. 35 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued Other operations and maintenance increased 47%, primarily reflecting: A $1.6 billion impairment charge due to bids received for Brayton Point and Kincaid; A $415 million impairment charge due to management decision to cease operations and begin decommissioning Kewaunee in 2013; and A $107 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits. These increases were partially offset by: The absence of an impairment charge recorded in 2011 related to certain utility coal-fired generating units ($228 million); A $117 million decrease in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily related to low income assistance programs. These expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income; and The absence of restoration costs recorded in 2011 associated with damages caused by Hurricane Irene ($96 million). Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased 11%, primarily due to property additions. Other Income increased 25%, primarily due to higher realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Income tax expense decreased 81%, primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income in 2012. 2011 VS . 2010 Net Revenue decreased 7%, primarily reflecting: A $504 million decrease from merchant generation operations, primarily due to a decrease in realized prices ($340 million) and lower generation ($153 million); and A $125 million decrease reflecting the sale of substantially all of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010. These decreases were partially offset by: A $32 million increase from Dominion gas transmission business primarily related to an increase in revenue from NGLs; A $28 million increase in producer services primarily related to higher physical margins and favorable price changes on economic hedging positions, all associated with natural gas aggregation, marketing and trading activities; A $13 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting: The impact of rate adjustment clauses ($169 million); and A decrease in net capacity expenses ($44 million); partially offset by The impact ($120 million) of a decrease in sales to retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in heating and cooling degree days ($220 million), partially offset by an increase in sales due to the effect of favorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($100 million); and A decrease due to a charge based on the Biennial Review Order to refund revenues to customers ($81 million). Other operations and maintenance decreased 4% primarily reflecting: A $434 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits primarily related to a 2010 workforce reduction program; partially offset by A $228 million impairment charge related to certain utility coal-fired generating units; and A $96 million increase due to restoration costs associated with damage caused by Hurricane Irene. Gain on sale of Appalachian E&P operations reflects a gain on the sale of these operations, as described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and related charges increased 5%, primarily due to the absence of a benefit recorded in 2010 resulting from the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain interest rate derivatives ($73 million) and an increase in debt issuances in 2011 ($18 million), partially offset by the recognition of hedging gains that had previously been deferred as regulatory liabilities as a result of the Biennial Review Order ($50 million). Income tax expense decreased 64%, primarily reflecting lower federal and state taxes largely due to the absence of a gain from the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations recorded in 2010. Loss from discontinued operations reflects the sale of Peoples in 2010, as well as losses associated with State Line and Salem Harbor, which were reclassified to discontinued operations as a result of their sale in 2012. Outlook Dominion strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide earnings per share growth, a growing dividend and to maintain a stable credit profile. Dominion is in the process of transitioning to a more regulated earnings mix, and is targeting 80-90 percent of its earnings to come from regulated businesses in 2013 and beyond. This is evidenced by Dominion capital investments in regulated infrastructure, as well as its disposition of certain merchant generation facilities during 2012 and its announcement that certain other merchant generation facilities are expected to be sold or decommissioned in 2013. In 2013, Dominion is expected to experience an increase in net income on a per share basis as compared to 2012. Dominion anticipated 2013 results reflect the following significant factors: The absence of impairment charges incurred in 2012 associated with certain merchant generating facilities; A return to normal weather in its electric utility operations; Construction and operation of growth projects in electric utility operations and associated rate adjustment clause revenue, as well as full-year earnings from gas transmission and gas distribution projects placed in service in 2012; and Growth in weather-normalized electric utility sales of approximately 2% resulting from the recovering economy and rising energy demand; partially offset by An increase in interest expense; Increases in certain operations and maintenance expense; and An increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization. On January 2, 2013, U.S. federal legislation was enacted that provides an extension of the 50 percent bonus depreciation allowance for qualifying capital expenditures incurred through 2013, as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other operations and maintenance decreased 16%, primarily reflecting: The absence of an impairment charge recorded in 2011 related to certain coal-fired generating units ($228 million); and The absence of restoration costs recorded in 2011 associated with damage caused by Hurricane Irene ($96 million); partially offset by A $64 million increase in storm damage and service restoration costs primarily due to the damage caused by severe storms in 2012. Interest and related charges increased 16%, primarily due to the absence of the recognition of hedging gains into income in 2011, that had been deferred as regulatory liabilities, as a result of the Biennial Review Order. Income tax expense increased 21%, primarily reflecting higher pre-tax income in 2012. 2011 VS . 2010 Net Revenue increased $13 million, primarily reflecting: The impact of rate adjustment clauses ($169 million); and A decrease in net capacity expenses ($44 million); partially offset by The impact ($120 million) of a decrease in sales to retail customers, primarily due to a decrease in heating and cooling degree days ($220 million), partially offset by an increase in sales due to the effect of favorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($100 million); and A decrease due to a charge based on the Biennial Review Order to refund revenues to customers ($81 million). Other operations and maintenance decreased $2 million, primarily reflecting: A $267 million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits as well as certain administrative and general costs primarily due to a 2010 workforce reduction program; and A $54 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to fewer scheduled outage days at certain generation facilities; partially offset by A $228 million impairment charge related to certain coal-fired generating units; and A $96 million increase due to restoration costs associated with damage caused by Hurricane Irene. Other income decreased 12%, primarily due to a decrease in the equity component of AFUDC ($17 million), partially offset by an increase in amounts collectible from customers for taxes in connection with contributions in aid of construction ($5 million). Outlook Virginia Power expects to provide growth in net income in 2013. Virginia Power anticipated 2013 results reflect the following significant factors: A return to normal weather; Growth in weather-normalized electric sales of approximately 2% resulting from the recovering economy and rising energy demand; and Construction and operation of growth projects and associated rate adjustment clause revenue; partially offset by Increases in certain operations and maintenance expense; and An increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization. On January 2, 2013, U.S. federal legislation was enacted that provides an extension of the 50 percent bonus depreciation allowance for qualifying capital expenditures incurred through 2013, as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued Statements. Virginia Power expects the bonus depreciation provisions to reduce income taxes otherwise payable, resulting in cash savings in 2013 and 2014 of approximately $200 million and $250 million, respectively.

See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these items. S ELECTED I NFORMATION E NERGY T RADING A CTIVITIES Dominion engages in energy trading, marketing and hedging activities to complement its businesses and facilitate its price risk management activities. As part of these operations, Dominion enters into contracts for purchases and sales of energy-related commodities, including electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products. Settlements of contracts may require physical delivery of the underlying commodity or cash settlement. Dominion also enters into contracts with the objective of benefiting from changes in prices. For example, after entering into a contract to purchase a commodity, Dominion typically enters into a sales contract, or a combination of sales contracts, with quantities and delivery or settlement terms that are identical or very similar to those of the purchase contract. When the purchase and sales contracts are settled either by physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by net cash settlement, Dominion may receive a net cash margin (a realized gain), or may pay a net cash margin (a realized loss). Dominion continually monitors its contract positions, considering location and timing of delivery or settlement for each energy commodity in relation to market price activity. A summary of the changes in the unrealized gains and losses recognized for Dominion energy-related derivative instruments held for trading purposes follows: Amount (millions) Net unrealized gain at December 31, 2011 $ 20 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 3 Change in unrealized gains and losses 55 Net unrealized gain at December 31, 2012 $ 78 The balance of net unrealized gains and losses recognized for Dominion energy-related derivative instruments held for trading purposes at December 31, 2012, is summarized in the following table based on the approach used to determine fair value: Maturity Based on Contract Settlement or Delivery Date(s) Sources of Fair Value 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 and thereafter Total (millions) Prices actively quoted Level 1 (1) $ $ $ $ $ Prices provided by other external sources Level 2 (2) 59 26 2 87 Prices based on models and other valuation methods Level 3 (3) 1 (6 ) (4 ) (9 ) Total $ 60 $ 20 $ (2 ) $ $ 78 (1) Values represent observable unadjusted quoted prices for traded instruments in active markets. (2) Values with inputs that are observable directly or indirectly for the instrument, but do not qualify for Level 1. (3) Values with a significant amount of inputs that are not observable for the instrument. L IQUIDITY AND C APITAL R ESOURCES Dominion and Virginia Power depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities. At December 31, 2012, Dominion had $1.1 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities, including $256 million of unused capacity under joint credit facilities available to Virginia Power. See additional discussion under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt . The disposition of certain merchant generation facilities during 2012 and the expected sale or decommissioning of certain other merchant generation facilities in 2013 are not expected to negatively impact Dominion liquidity. A summary of Dominion cash flows is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 102 $ 62 $ 50 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 4,137 2,983 1,825 Investing activities (3,840 ) (3,321 ) 419 Financing activities (151 ) 378 (2,232 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 146 40 12 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 248 $ 102 $ 62 41 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued A summary of Virginia Power cash flows is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 29 $ 5 $ 19 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 2,706 2,024 1,409 Investing activities (2,282 ) (1,947 ) (2,425 ) Financing activities (425 ) (53 ) 1,002 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (1 ) 24 (14 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 28 $ 29 $ 5 Operating Cash Flows In 2012, net cash provided by Dominion operating activities increased by approximately $1.2 billion, primarily due to higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in its Virginia jurisdiction, lower margin collateral requirements, changes in other working capital items and income tax refunds in 2012 as compared to income tax payments in 2011. The increase was partially offset by lower merchant generation margins and the impact of less favorable weather. In 2012, net cash provided by Virginia Power operating activities increased by $682 million, primarily due to higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in its Virginia jurisdiction and net changes in other working capital items, partially offset by income tax payments in 2012 as compared to income tax refunds in 2011 and the impact of less favorable weather. Dominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In 2012, Dominion Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy that raised its target payout ratio to 65-70%, and established an annual dividend rate for 2013 of $2.25 per share of common stock, a 6.6% increase over the 2012 rate. Declarations of dividends are subject to further Board of Directors approval. Virginia Power believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and provide dividends to Dominion. The Companies operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows, and which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. C REDIT R ISK Dominion exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion credit exposure as of December 31, 2012 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross Credit Exposure Credit Collateral Net Credit Exposure (millions) Investment grade (1) $ 281 $ $ 281 Non-investment grade (2) 4 4 No external ratings: Internally rated-investment grade (3) 113 113 Internally rated-non-investment grade (4) 114 114 Total $ 512 $ $ 512 (1) Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody and Standard & Poor s. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 28% of the total net credit exposure. (2) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 1% of the total net credit exposure. (3) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 13% of the total net credit exposure. (4) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 15% of the total net credit exposure. Virginia Power exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from sales to wholesale customers and was not considered material at December 31, 2012. Investing Cash Flows In 2012, net cash used in Dominion investing activities increased by $519 million, primarily due to higher capital expenditures, mainly related to investments in growth projects, and lower restricted cash reimbursements for the purpose of funding certain qualifying construction projects, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets, primarily related to Blue Racer, in 2012. In 2012, net cash used in Virginia Power investing activities increased by $335 million, primarily due to higher capital expenditures and lower restricted cash reimbursements for the purpose of funding certain qualifying construction projects. Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity Dominion and Virginia Power rely on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by their operations. As discussed in Credit Ratings, the Companies ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances and, in the case of Virginia Power, approval by the Virginia Commission. Each of the Companies currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows the Companies to use automatic shelf registra- 42 Table of Contents tion statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions. In 2012, net cash used in Dominion financing activities was $151 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $378 million in 2011, primarily reflecting lower net debt issuances in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a result of higher cash flow from operations, partially offset by the absence of the repurchases of common stock recorded in 2011. In 2012, net cash used in Virginia Power financing activities increased by $372 million, primarily reflecting lower net debt issuances in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a result of higher cash flow from operations. C REDIT F ACILITIES AND S HORT -T ERM D EBT Dominion and Virginia Power use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties. In connection with commodity hedging activities, the Companies are required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, the Companies may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, the Companies vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which the Companies can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives. Dominion Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under credit facilities, were as follows: December 31, 2012 Facility Limit Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding Letters of Credit Facility Capacity Available (millions) Joint revolving credit facility (1) $ 3,000 $ 2,412 $ $ 588 Joint revolving credit facility (2) 500 26 474 Total $ 3,500 $ 2,412 (3) $ 26 $ 1,062 (1) Effective September 2012, the maturity date was extended from September 2016 to September 2017. This credit facility can be used to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to $1.5 billion of letters of credit. (2) Effective September 2012, the maturity date for $400 million of the $500 million in committed capacity of this credit facility was extended from September 2016 to September 2017. The remaining $100 million continues to have a maturity date of September 2016. This credit facility can be used to support bank borrowings, commercial paper and letter of credit issuances. (3) The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by Dominion credit facilities was 0.49% at December 31, 2012. Virginia Power Virginia Power short-term financing is supported by two joint revolving credit facilities with Dominion. These credit facilities are being used for working capital, as support for the combined commercial paper programs of Dominion and Virginia Power and for other general corporate purposes. Virginia Power share of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as its capacity available under its joint credit facilities with Dominion, were as follows: December 31, 2012 Facility Sub-limit Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding Letters of Credit Facility Sub-limit Capacity Available (millions) Joint revolving credit facility (1) $ 1,000 $ 992 $ $ 8 Joint revolving credit facility (2) 250 2 248 Total $ 1,250 $ 992 (3) $ 2 $ 256 (1) Effective September 2012, the maturity date was extended from September 2016 to September 2017. This credit facility can be used to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to $1.5 billion (or the sub-limit, whichever is less) of letters of credit. Virginia Power current sub-limit under this credit facility can be increased or decreased multiple times per year. (2) Effective September 2012, the maturity date for $400 million of the $500 million in committed capacity of this credit facility was extended from September 2016 to September 2017. The remaining $100 million continues to have a maturity date of September 2016. This credit facility can be used to support bank borrowings, commercial paper and letter of credit issuances. Virginia Power current sub-limit under this credit facility can be increased or decreased multiple times per year. (3) The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by these credit facilities was 0.47% at December 31, 2012. In addition to the credit facility commitments mentioned above, Virginia Power also has a $120 million credit facility. Effective September 2012, the maturity date was extended from September 2016 to September 2017. This facility supports certain tax-exempt financings of Virginia Power. S HORT - TERM N OTES In November and December 2012, Dominion issued $250 million and $150 million, respectively, of private placement short-term notes that mature in November 2013 and bear interest at a variable rate. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. L ONG - TERM D EBT During 2012, Dominion and Virginia Power issued the following long-term debt: Type Principal Rate Maturity Issuing Company (millions) Senior notes $ 350 1.40 % 2017 Dominion Senior notes 350 2.75 % 2022 Dominion Senior notes 350 4.05 % 2042 Dominion Senior notes 450 2.95 % 2022 Virginia Power Total notes issued $ 1,500 In December 2011, Virginia Power borrowed $75 million in connection with the Economic Development Authority of the County of Chesterfield Pollution Control Refunding Revenue 43 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued Bonds, Series 2011 A, which mature in 2017 and bear interest during the initial period at a variable rate for the first five years, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time, using a remarketing process. The proceeds were used to refund the principal amount of the Industrial Development Authority of the County of Chesterfield, Virginia Money Market Municipals TM Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, Series 1987 A and Series 1987 B that would otherwise have matured in June 2017. During 2012, Dominion and Virginia Power repaid and repurchased $1.7 billion and $641 million, respectively, of long-term debt. I SSUANCE OF C OMMON S TOCK Dominion maintains Dominion Direct and a number of employee savings plans through which contributions may be invested in Dominion common stock. These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. In January 2012, Dominion began issuing new common shares for these direct stock purchase plans. During 2012, Dominion issued approximately 6.4 million shares of common stock through various programs. Dominion received cash proceeds of $265 million from the issuance of 5.3 million of such shares through Dominion Direct, employee savings plans, and the exercise of employee stock options. In January 2012, Dominion filed a new SEC shelf registration for the sale of debt and equity securities including the ability to sell common stock through an at the market program. Dominion entered into four separate Sales Agency Agreements to effect sales under the program. However, with the exception of issuing approximately $318 million in equity through employee savings plans, direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans, converted securities and other employee and director benefit plans, Dominion did not issue common stock in 2012. In 2012, Virginia Power did not issue any shares of its common stock to Dominion. R EPURCHASE OF C OMMON S TOCK Dominion did not repurchase any shares in 2012 and does not plan to repurchase shares during 2013, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which do not count against its stock repurchase authorization. B ORROWINGS F ROM P ARENT Virginia Power has the ability to borrow funds from Dominion under both short-term and long-term borrowing arrangements. Virginia Power short-term demand note borrowings from Dominion were $243 million at December 31, 2012. There were no long-term borrowings from Dominion at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, Virginia Power nonregulated subsidiaries had outstanding borrowings, net of repayments, under the Dominion money pool of $192 million. Credit Ratings Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion and Virginia Power believe that their current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion and Virginia Power may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion and Virginia Power credit ratings may affect their liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which they are able to offer their debt securities. Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion and Virginia Power are affected by each company financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions. Credit ratings as of February 22, 2013 follow: Fitch Moody Standard & Poor Dominion Senior unsecured debt securities BBB+ Baa2 A- Junior subordinated debt securities BBB- Baa3 BBB Enhanced junior subordinated notes BBB- Baa3 BBB Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 Virginia Power Mortgage bonds A A1 A Senior unsecured (including tax-exempt) debt securities A- A3 A- Junior subordinated debt securities BBB Baa1 BBB Preferred stock BBB Baa2 BBB Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 As of February 22, 2013, Fitch, Moody and Standard & Poor maintained a stable outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion and Virginia Power. A downgrade in an individual company credit rating would not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it would likely increase the cost of borrowing. Dominion and Virginia Power work closely with Fitch, Moody and Standard & Poor with the objective of maintaining their current credit ratings. The Companies may find it necessary to modify their business plans to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS. Debt Covenants As part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion and Virginia Power must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with 44 Table of Contents each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion and Virginia Power. Some of the typical covenants include: The timely payment of principal and interest; Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC and information about changes in Dominion and Virginia Power credit ratings to lenders; Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation, and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets; Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and Limitations on liens. Dominion and Virginia Power are required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain their credit facilities. In addition, their credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect their ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions. As of December 31, 2012, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows: Company Maximum Allowed Ratio Actual Ratio (1) Dominion 65 % 60 % Virginia Power 65 % 46 % (1) Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes junior subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt or securities due within one year as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These provisions apply separately to Dominion and Virginia Power. If Dominion or Virginia Power or any of either company material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require that company to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and the lenders could terminate their commitment to lend funds to that company. Accordingly, any default by Dominion will not affect the lenders commitment to Virginia Power. However, any default by Virginia Power would affect the lenders commitment to Dominion under the joint credit agreements. Dominion executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the following hybrid securities: June 2006 hybrids; September 2006 hybrids; and June 2009 hybrids. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for terms of the RCCs. At December 31, 2012, the termination dates and covered debt under the RCCs associated with Dominion hybrids were as follows: Hybrid RCC Termination Date Designated Covered Debt Under RCC June 2006 hybrids 6/30/2036 September 2006 hybrids September 2006 hybrids 9/30/2036 June 2006 hybrids June 2009 hybrids 6/15/2034 (1) 2008 Series B Senior Notes, 7.0% due 2038 (1) Automatically extended, as set forth in the RCC, for additional quarterly periods, to the extent the maturity date is extended. Dominion and Virginia Power monitor the debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2012, there have been no events of default under or changes to Dominion or Virginia Power debt covenants. Virginia Power Mortgage Supplement Substantially all of Virginia Power property is subject to the lien of the Indenture of Mortgage securing its First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds. In July 2012, Virginia Power entered into a supplement to the indenture in order to amend various of its terms and conditions and to incorporate certain new provisions. The supplement reduces Virginia Power overall compliance responsibilities associated with the indenture by limiting the maximum principal amount of bonds that may be outstanding under the indenture to $10 million unless otherwise provided in a further supplement, and by modifying or eliminating altogether certain compliance requirements while there are no bonds outstanding. The supplement also provides Virginia Power with flexibility to determine when or if certain newly or recently acquired properties will be pledged as collateral under the indenture. There were no bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2012; however, by leaving the indenture open, Virginia Power expects to retain the flexibility to issue mortgage bonds in the future. Dividend Restrictions The Virginia Commission may prohibit any public service company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a dividend to an affiliate if found to be detrimental to the public interest. At December 31, 2012, the Virginia Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by Virginia Power. Certain agreements associated with Dominion and Virginia Power credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion or Virginia Power ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from their subsidiaries at December 31, 2012. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion in connection with the deferral of interest payments on junior subordinated notes, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures C ONTRACTUAL O BLIGATIONS Dominion and Virginia Power are party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating them to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which Dominion and Virginia Power are parties as of December 31, 2012. For purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. The majority of Dominion and Virginia Power current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2013. Dominion 2013 2014- 2015 2016- 2017 2018 and thereafter Total (millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,200 $ 2,058 $ 2,790 $ 11,940 $ 18,988 Interest payments (2) 898 1,693 1,457 12,218 16,266 Leases (3) 79 136 118 161 494 Purchase obligations (4) : Purchased electric capacity for utility operations 350 695 456 327 1,828 Fuel commitments for utility operations 716 778 265 259 2,018 Fuel commitments for nonregulated operations 254 258 116 187 815 Pipeline transportation and storage 131 174 96 366 767 Energy commodity purchases for resale (5) 79 32 29 146 286 Other (6) 469 56 7 21 553 Other long-term liabilities (7) : Financial derivative-commodities (5) 48 29 3 80 Other contractual obligations (8) 16 12 30 2 60 Total cash payments $ 5,240 $ 5,921 $ 5,367 $ 25,627 $ 42,155 (1) Based on stated maturity dates rather than the earlier redemption dates that could be elected by instrument holders. (2) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate or forward interest rate curve at December 31, 2012 and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instrument stated maturity. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Does not reflect Dominion ability to defer interest payments on junior subordinated notes. (3) Primarily consists of operating leases. (4) Amounts exclude open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. (5) Represents the summation of settlement amounts, by contracts, due from Dominion if all physical or financial transactions among its counterparties and Dominion were liquidated and terminated. (6) Includes capital, operations, and maintenance commitments. (7) Excludes regulatory liabilities, AROs and employee benefit plan obligations, which are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount. See Notes 12, 14 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to uncertainty about the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, $233 million of income taxes payable associated with unrecognized tax benefits are excluded. Deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (8) Includes interest rate swap agreements.

(6) Excludes regulatory liabilities, AROs and employee benefit plan contributions that are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount. See Notes 12, 14 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to uncertainty about the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, $57 million of income taxes payable associated with unrecognized tax benefits are excluded. Deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. P LANNED C APITAL E XPENDITURES Dominion planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $4.7 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.3 billion in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Dominion expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel and the buyout of the lease at Fairless in 2013. Virginia Power planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $2.6 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.3 billion in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Virginia Power expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets and purchases of nuclear fuel. Dominion and Virginia Power expect to fund their capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the respective company Board of Directors. Based on available generation capacity and current estimates of growth in customer demand, Virginia Power will need additional generation in the future. See DVP, Dominion Generation and Dominion Energy-Properties in Item 1. Business for a discussion of Dominion and Virginia Power expansion plans. These estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by Dominion Board of Directors in late 46 Table of Contents 2012 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. The Companies may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances. Use of Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements G UARANTEES Dominion primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the provisions of FASB guidance that dictate a guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others . See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, which information is incorporated herein by reference. F UTURE I SSUES AND O THER M ATTERS See Item 1. Business, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Notes 13 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Environmental Matters Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations. E NVIRONMENTAL P ROTECTION AND M ONITORING E XPENDITURES Dominion incurred approximately $189 million, $184 million and $228 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2012, 2011, and 2010 respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities and expects these expenses to be approximately $193 million and $181 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $213 million, $403 million, and $351 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million and $115 million for 2013 and 2014, respectively. Virginia Power incurred approximately $120 million, $129 million and $144 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities and expects these expenses to be approximately $148 million and $157 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $34 million, $77 million and $101 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $20 million and $99 million for 2013 and 2014, respectively. F UTURE E NVIRONMENTAL R EGULATIONS Air The CAA is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of Dominion and Virginia Power facilities are subject to the CAA permitting and other requirements. In December 2012, the EPA issued a final rule that set a more stringent annual air quality standard for fine particulate matter. The EPA is expected to complete final air quality designations by December 2014. States will have until 2020 to meet the revised standard. The extent to which a revised particulate matter standard will impact Dominion is uncertain at this time, but is not expected to be material. The EPA has finalized rules establishing a new 1-hour NAAQS for NO 2 and a new 1-hour NAAQS for SO 2 , which could require additional NO X and SO 2 controls in certain areas where the Companies operate. Until the states have developed implementation plans for these standards, the impact on Dominion or Virginia Power facilities that emit NO X and SO 2 is uncertain. In January 2010, the EPA also proposed a new, more stringent NAAQS for ozone and had planned to finalize the rule in 2011. In September 2011, the EPA announced a delay from 2011 to 2014 of the rulemaking, therefore NO x controls that may have been required by the rulemaking are also expected to be delayed. In the interim, the EPA is proceeding with implementation of the current ozone standard and made final attainment/nonattainment designations in May 2012. Several Dominion electric generating facilities are located in areas impacted by this standard. Until the states have developed implementation plans for the new NO x , SO 2 and ozone standards, it is not possible to determine the impact on Dominion or Virginia Power facilities that emit NO X and SO 2 . The Companies cannot currently predict with certainty whether or to what extent the new rules will ultimately require additional controls, however, if significant expenditures are required, it could adversely affect Dominion results of operations, and Dominion and Virginia Power cash flows. In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to the Regional Haze Rule, also known as the Clean Air Visibility Rule. The rule requires the states to implement Best Available Retrofit Technology requirements for sources to address impacts to visual air quality through regional haze state implementation plans, but allows other alternative options. The EPA is in the process of completing rulemakings on regional haze state implementation plans. Although Dominion and Virginia Power anticipate that the emission reductions achieved through compliance with other CAA-required programs will generally address this rule, additional emission reduction requirements may be imposed on the Companies facilities. Water The CWA is a comprehensive program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. Dominion and Virginia Power must comply with all aspects of the CWA programs at their operating facilities. In July 2004, the EPA published regulations under CWA Section 316(b) that govern existing utilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold. In April 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court granted an industry 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued request to review the question of whether Section 316(b) authorizes the EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in April 2009 that the EPA has the authority to consider costs versus environmental benefits in selecting the best technology available for reducing impacts of cooling water intakes at power stations. It is currently unknown how the EPA will interpret the ruling in its ongoing rulemaking activity addressing cooling water intakes as well as how the states will implement this decision. In April 2011, the EPA published the proposed rule related to Section 316(b) in the Federal Register, and agreed to publish a final rule no later than July 27, 2012. In July 2012, the EPA announced a delay to no later than June 27, 2013 of its impending rulemaking related to Section 316(b). The rule in its proposed form seeks to establish a uniform national standard for impingement, but forgoes the creation of a single technology standard for entrainment. Instead, the EPA proposes to delegate entrainment technology decisions to state regulators. State regulators are to make case-by-case entrainment technology determinations after an examination of nine facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test. The proposed rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above two MGD, with a heightened entrainment analysis for those facilities over 125 MGD. Under this proposal, Dominion has 16 facilities that may be subject to these proposed regulations. If finalized as proposed, Dominion anticipates that it will have to install impingement control technologies at many of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. Dominion and Virginia Power cannot estimate the need or potential for entrainment controls under the proposed rule as these decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after a thorough review of detailed biological, technology, cost and benefit studies. However, the impacts of this proposed rule may be material to the results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Solid and Hazardous Waste In June 2010, the EPA proposed federal regulations under the RCRA for management of coal combustion by-products generated by power plants. The EPA is considering two possible options for the regulation of coal combustion by-products, both of which fall under the RCRA. Under the first proposal, the EPA would classify these by-products as special wastes subject to regulation under subtitle C, the hazardous waste provisions of the RCRA, when destined for disposal at landfills or surface impoundments. Under the second proposal, the EPA would regulate coal combustion by-products under subtitle D of the RCRA, the section for non-hazardous wastes. While the Companies cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter, regulation under either option will affect Dominion and Virginia Power onsite disposal facilities and coal combustion by-product management practices, and potentially require material investments. Climate Change Legislation and Regulation In December 2009, the EPA issued their Final Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act , finding that GHGs endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations. On April 1, 2010, the EPA and the Department of Transportation National Highway Safety Administration announced a joint final rule establishing a program that will dramatically reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy for new cars and trucks sold in the United States. These rules took effect in January 2011 and established GHG emissions as regulated pollutants under the CAA. In May 2010, the EPA issued the Final Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule that, combined with prior actions, require Dominion and Virginia Power to obtain permits for GHG emissions for new and modified facilities over certain size thresholds, and meet best available control technology for GHG emissions. The EPA has issued draft guidance for GHG permitting, including best available control technology. In April 2012, the EPA published proposed NSPS for GHG emissions for new electric generating units. This proposed rule sets national emission standards for new coal, oil, integrated gasification combined cycle, and combined cycle units larger than 25MW. The rule, which is expected to be finalized in the Spring of 2013, covers CO 2 only and does not apply to existing sources. New natural gas combined cycle units, including Brunswick County, are expected to be able to meet this standard. The rule also does not apply to any new or existing simple cycle combustion turbine units or biomass units. The schedule for a final rulemaking governing a GHG NSPS for existing sources is uncertain. There are other legislative proposals that may be considered that would have an indirect impact on GHG emissions. There is the potential for the U.S. Congress to consider a mandatory Clean Energy Standard. In addition to possible federal action, some regions and states in which Dominion and Virginia Power operate have already adopted or may adopt GHG emission reduction programs. Any of these new or contemplated regulations may affect capital costs, or create significant permitting delays, for new or modified facilities that emit GHGs. In July 2008, Massachusetts passed the GWSA. Among other provisions, the GWSA sets economy-wide GHG emissions reduction goals for Massachusetts, including reductions of 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, interim goals for 2030 and 2040 and reductions of 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. No regulations impacting Dominion under the GWSA have been proposed. Dominion operates Brayton Point in Massachusetts and acts as a retail electric supplier in Massachusetts, which are subject to the implementation of the GWSA. In December 2009, the governors of 11 Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, including Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island (RGGI states plus Pennsylvania) signed a memorandum of understanding committing their states toward developing a low carbon fuel standard to reduce GHG emissions from vehicles. The memorandum of understanding established a process to develop a regional framework by 2011 and examine the economic impacts of a low carbon fuel standard program. Although economic studies and policy options were examined in 2011, a definitive framework has yet to be established. 48 Table of Contents Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can choose to exempt their hedging transactions from these clearing and exchange trading requirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be established through the ongoing rulemaking process of the applicable regulators. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominion or Virginia Power derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs, including from higher margin requirements, for their derivative activities. In addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the over-the-counter derivative provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities. Due to the ongoing rulemaking process, the Companies are currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act derivative-related provisions on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Cove Point Export Project Dominion is pursuing a liquefaction project at Cove Point, which would enable the facility to liquefy domestically-produced natural gas and export it as LNG. The project, which is expected to cost between approximately $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion, exclusive of financing costs, has a planned capacity of approximately 750 million cubic feet per day on the inlet and approximately 4.5 to 5 million metric tons per annum on the outlet. In 2011, Cove Point requested authorization from the DOE to export LNG to countries that have a free trade agreement requiring trade in natural gas with the U.S. as well as countries that do not have such a free trade agreement. In October 2011, Cove Point received authorization from the DOE to export LNG to free trade agreement countries and Cove Point expects to receive authorization from the DOE to export LNG to non-free trade agreement countries in 2013. In June 2012, FERC approved Cove Point request to initiate the pre-filing process under which environmental review for the project commenced. Approval of the project could take up to two years from the pre-filing approval date. In March 2012, Cove Point entered into precedent agreements with two major companies, one of which is Sumitomo Corporation, pursuant to which Cove Point would provide liquefaction, storage and loading services but would not own or directly export the LNG. In October 2012, Cove Point and the unnamed company terminated their precedent agreement by mutual consent. In December 2012, Cove Point entered into a 20-year terminal services agreement with Pacific Summit Energy LLC, a U.S. subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation, for half of the planned project capacity. The agreement contains final terms subject to certain conditions precedent which include conditions related to customer contracting. Cove Point is in active negotiations with a company for a definitive terminal services agreement for the remaining half of the planned project capacity. In May 2012, in response to claims by the Sierra Club, Cove Point filed a complaint for declaratory judgment to confirm its right to construct the project. In January 2013, a Maryland circuit court issued declaratory judgment confirming Cove Point right to build liquefaction facilities. In February 2013, the Sierra Club filed a notice of appeal with the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. Subject to a final decision on pursuing the project, execution of binding terminal service agreements, receipt of regulatory and other approvals, and successful completion of engineering studies, construction of liquefaction facilities could begin in 2014 with an in-service date in 2017. Cove Point Re-Export Project In August 2011, Cove Point filed an application with the DOE seeking blanket authority to re-export up to the equivalent of 150 bcf of foreign-sourced LNG from the Cove Point terminal over a two-year period. In January 2012, the DOE conditionally approved Cove Point application. Due to lack of customer interest in re-export, Cove Point made no filings with FERC and the DOE re-export authorization automatically terminated in January 2013. Regulation Act Legislation In January 2013, legislation was introduced in the Virginia General Assembly which would amend the Regulation Act. The legislation passed the Virginia House of Delegates and the Senate of Virginia and was signed into law by the governor in February 2013. Among other things the amendments eliminate the 50 basis points RPS ROE incentive prospectively, as well as the new generation ROE incentives for future projects, except for nuclear and offshore wind projects, which instead are reduced from the current 200 basis points ROE incentive to 100 basis points. ROE incentives for previously approved, as well as filed for but unconstructed projects, remain in place. In addition, the performance incentive provision of the Regulation Act, authorizing the Virginia Commission to increase or decrease a utility authorized ROE by up to 100 basis points based on operating comparisons with certain nationally recognized standards, is removed and the Virginia Commission has the discretion to increase or decrease a utility authorized ROE based on commission precedent that existed prior to the enactment of the Regulation Act. The legislation includes changes to the earnings test parameters defined by the Regulation Act to allow for a wider band of 70 basis points above and below the authorized ROE in determining whether a utility earned ROE is either insufficient or excessive beginning with the biennial review for 2013-2014 to be filed in 2015. Additionally, if a utility is deemed to have over-earned, the customer refund share of excess earnings increases to 70% from the current 60% level beginning with the biennial review for 2013-2014 to be filed in 2015. The legislation also provides guidance to the Virginia Commission on rate-making treatment for severe weather events and natural disasters and for asset impairments related to early retirements of utility generation plants, for which the decision to retire was made before December 31, 2012. This guidance on rate-making treatment applies to Virginia Power upcoming biennial review for 2011-2012 to be filed in 2013. Additionally, the provision in the Regulation Act requiring the Virginia Commission to combine transmission-related rider costs with base rates is eliminated and the transmission costs will con- 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued tinue to be segregated and recovered separately. The legislation requires a utility seeking approval to construct a generating facility to demonstrate that it has considered and weighed alternative options in its selection process. Virginia Offshore Wind Lease In March 2012, Virginia Power filed a notice with BOEM of its interest in obtaining leases off the Virginia coast in an area sufficient for construction of offshore wind turbines having the potential to generate approximately 1,500-2,000 MW of electricity or enough electricity to serve approximately 500,000 homes at peak demand. In December 2012, BOEM announced that it would auction approximately 113,000 acres off the Virginia coast as a single lease in 2013.
