ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Forward-Looking Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 ("Annual Report") for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our Company We believe that we are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products and services add value. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of Quick Response Centers ("QRCs"), we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. We currently employ approximately 18,000 employees in more than 50 countries. Our business model is significantly influenced by the capital spending of global infrastructure industries for the placement of new products into service and maintenance spending for aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes. Over the past several years, we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to drive customer investments in our offerings and use of our services to replace or repair installed products. The aftermarket portion of our business also helps provide business stability during various economic periods. The aftermarket business, which is primarily served by our network of 183 QRCs located around the globe, provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value-added services. It is generally a higher margin business compared to our original equipment business and a key component of our profitable growth strategy. Our operations are conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"): Engineered Product Division for long lead time, custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; Industrial Product Division for pre-configured engineered pumps and pump systems and related products and services; and Flow Control Division for engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators and controls and related services. Our business segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a high number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications that provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively. For example, our segment leadership reports to our Chief Operating Officer ("COO") and the segments share leadership for operational support functions, such as research and development, marketing and supply chain. The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, Valtek, Limitorque, Durco, Edward, Anchor/Darling and Durametallic, which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. Our products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world leading engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. We continue to leverage our QRC network to be positioned as near to customers as possible for service and support in order to capture valuable aftermarket business. Along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell, install and service our equipment in remote regions, it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations. We continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our 28 products. Additionally, we continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our business segments to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands. We also remain focused on improving on-time delivery and quality, while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations, through the assistance of a focused Continuous Improvement Process ("CIP") initiative. The goal of the CIP initiative, which includes lean manufacturing, six sigma business management strategy and value engineering, is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. During 2015, 2016 and in early 2017, we have been challenged by broad-based capital spending declines, originating in the oil and gas industry, heightened pricing pressures and negative currency impacts caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. This has been further compounded by economic and geo-political conditions in Latin America, the Middle East and China. In addition, we experienced lower than expected activity levels in our aftermarket business due to deferred spending of our customers' repair and maintenance budgets. We expect that the current environment will persist into 2017, with potential improvement in the second half of the year. We have experienced a deterioration from plan in the operating results of our Engineered Product Operations ("EPO") and IPD reporting units which we believe was both operationally and market driven. We have concluded that there is no impairment of the goodwill associated with EPO and IPD as of December 31, 2016 . Conditions are uncertain and can quickly change in the markets in which we operate which could result in sustained or further deterioration and could impact the recoverability of certain of our long-lived assets, including goodwill. We will continue to closely monitor their performance and related market conditions. To better align costs and improve long-term efficiency, we initiated Realignment Programs to accelerate both short- and long-term strategic plans, including targeted manufacturing optimization through the consolidation of facilities, SG&A efficiency initiatives, transfer of activities from high-cost regions to lower-cost facilities and the divestiture of certain non-strategic assets. At the completion of the programs, we expect a 15% to 20% reduction in our global workforce, relative to early 2015 workforce levels. With an expected near-term investment of approximately $400 million , including projects still under final evaluation, we expect the results of our Realignment Programs will deliver annualized run-rate savings of approximately $230 million . Since inception of the Realignment Programs in 2015, we have incurred charges of $222.6 million and we expect to incur most remaining charges in 2017. In addition, we are focusing on our ongoing low-cost sourcing, including greater use of third-party suppliers and increasing our lower-cost, emerging market capabilities. Our Markets The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the "Outlook for 2017 " section included below in this MD&A. Our products and services are used in several distinct industries: oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management, and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as "general industries." Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of new capital investment depends, in turn, on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas, chemicals, power generation and water management, as well as general economic conditions. These drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior. The levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment, planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process. Sales to EPC firms and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications, as are certain sales to distributors. Project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects. The quick turnaround business, which we also refer to as "short-cycle," is defined as orders that are received from the customer (booked) and shipped generally within six months of receipt. These orders are typically for more standardized, general purpose products, parts or services. Each of our three business segments generate certain levels of this type of business. In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from a large installed base of our original equipment, which requires periodic maintenance, repair and replacement parts. We use our manufacturing platform and global network of QRCs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. In 29 geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response, we believe customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products. However, the aftermarket for standard products is competitive, as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products. As proximity of service centers, timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services, we continue to selectively expand our global QRC capabilities to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business. Oil and Gas The oil and gas industry represented approximately 36% of our bookings in both 2016 and 2015 . Capital spending in the oil and gas industry decreased in 2016 compared to the previous year due to continued broad-based capital spending declines, heightened pricing pressures and negative currency impacts caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. Aftermarket opportunities in this industry decreased in 2016 due to deferred spending on our customers' repair and maintenance budgets and the impact of end-user union strikes in North America. The outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies. We believe lower oil prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2014 will continue to negatively impact oil and gas upstream investment most acutely and impact mid-stream and downstream investment to a lesser extent. In addition, a reduction in the overall level of spending by oil and gas companies could continue to decrease demand for our products and services. However, we believe the long-term fundamentals for this industry remain solid in spite of the current down cycle as the industry works through current excess supply with projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth. With our long-standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream, mid-stream and downstream applications, along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to assist our customers in this challenging environment. Chemical The chemical industry, which represented approximately 21% and 22% of our bookings in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, experienced a decreased level of capital spending in 2016 due to broad-based capital spending declines, heightened pricing pressures and negative currency impacts caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. The aftermarket opportunities decreased in 2016 due to deferred spending of our customers' repair and maintenance budgets. The outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions. As global economies stabilize and unemployment conditions improve, a rise in consumer spending should follow. An increase in spending would drive greater demand for chemical-based products supporting improved levels of capital investment. We believe the chemical industry in the near-term will continue to invest in North America and Middle East capacity additions, maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will selectively invest in capital infrastructure to meet current and future indigenous demand. We believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well-positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry. Power Generation The power generation industry represented approximately 14% of our bookings in both 2016 and 2015 . In 2016, the power generation industry continued to experience some softness in capital spending in the mature regions driven by the uncertainty related to environmental regulations, as well as potential regulatory impacts to the overall civilian nuclear market. In the developing regions, capital investment remained in place driven by increased demand forecasts for electricity in countries such as China and India. Global concerns about the environment continue to support an increase in desired future capacity from renewable energy sources. The majority of the active and planned construction throughout 2016 continued to utilize designs based on fossil fuels. Natural gas increased its percentage of utilization driven by market prices for gas remaining low and relatively stable. With the potential of unconventional sources of gas, such as shale gas, the power generation industry is forecasting an increased use of this form of fuel for power generation plants. We believe the outlook for the power generation industry remains favorable. Current legislative efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have an adverse effect on investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country. However, we believe that proposed methods of limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services. We believe the long-term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth, advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets. We also believe that our long-standing reputation in the power generation industry, our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods, our advancements in serving the 30 renewable energy market and carbon capture methodologies, as well as our global service and support structure, position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry. Water Management The water management industry represented approximately 4% our bookings in both 2016 and 2015 . Water management industry activity level experienced some softness in 2016 despite worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continuing to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems, many of which require products that we offer, particularly pumps. The proportion of people living in regions that find it difficult to meet water requirements is expected to double by 2025. We believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continued investments, especially in North America and developing regions. General Industries General industries represented, in the aggregate, approximately 25% and 24% of our bookings in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. General industries comprises a variety of different businesses, including mining and ore processing, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, none of which individually represented more than 5% of total bookings in 2016 and 2015 . General industries also includes sales to distributors, whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve. The outlook for this group of industries is heavily dependent upon the condition of global economies and consumer confidence levels. The long-term fundamentals of many of these industries remain sound, as many of the products produced by these industries are common staples of industrialized and urbanized economies. We believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide continued business opportunities. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion of our results of operations, we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have calculated currency effects on operations by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods. In the first and second quarters of 2015, we initiated realignment programs that consist of both restructuring and non-restructuring charges ("Realignment Programs") that are further discussed in Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Realignment Programs have continued throughout 2016 and the total charges for the Realignment Programs by segment are detailed below for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: December 31, 2016 (Amounts in thousands) Engineered Product Division Industrial Product Division Flow Control Division Subtotal Reportable Segments Eliminations and All Other Consolidated Total Total Realignment Program Charges COS $ 30,642 $ 26,224 $ 8,038 $ 64,904 $ 8 $ 64,912 SG&A 13,804 8,400 3,367 25,571 4,450 30,021 Income tax expense 6,000 2,800 600 9,400 9,400 Total $ 50,446 $ 37,424 $ 12,005 $ 99,875 $ 4,458 $ 104,333 31 December 31, 2015 (Amounts in thousands) Engineered Product Division Industrial Product Division Flow Control Division Subtotal Reportable Segments Eliminations and All Other Consolidated Total Total Realignment Program Charges COS $ 20,229 $ 28,607 $ 17,884 $ 66,720 $ $ 66,720 SG&A 14,006 15,407 11,024 40,437 40,437 Income tax expense 3,400 6,500 1,200 11,100 11,100 Total $ 37,635 $ 50,514 $ 30,108 $ 118,257 $ $ 118,257 We anticipate a total investment in these Realignment Programs of approximately $400 million , including projects still under final evaluation. Since inception of the Realignment Programs in 2015, we have incurred charges of $222.6 million and we expect to incur most remaining charges in 2017. Based on actions under our Realignment Programs, we estimate that we have achieved annual cost savings of approximately $120 million as of December 31, 2016 , of which approximately $75 million was in COS with the remainder in SG&A. Upon completion of the Realignment Programs, we expect annual run-rate cost savings of approximately $230 million . Actual savings could vary from expected savings, which represent management best estimate to date. Effective January 7, 2015, we acquired for inclusion in IPD, 100% of SIHI Group B.V. ("SIHI"), a global provider of engineered vacuum and fluid pumps and related services. Effective March 31, 2014, we sold our FCD Naval OY ("Naval") business to a Finnish valve manufacturer. The sale included Naval's manufacturing facility located in Laitila, Finland and a service and support center located in St. Petersburg, Russia. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report discusses the details of the above acquisition and disposition. Bookings and Backlog 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 3,760.4 $ 4,176.8 $ 5,161.0 Backlog (at period end) 1,897.7 2,173.2 2,704.2 We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer in regards to the manufacture, delivery, and/or support of products or the delivery of service. Bookings recorded and subsequently canceled within the same fiscal period are excluded from bookings. Bookings of $3.8 billion in 2016 decrease d by $416.4 million , or 10.0% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $108 million . The decrease was primarily driven by the oil and gas industry, and to a lesser extent, the chemical and general industries. The decrease was primarily due to customer original equipment bookings. Bookings in 2015 decreased by $984.2 million, or 19.1%, as compared with 2014. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $377 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the oil and gas industry, and to a lesser extent, the general and chemical industries. The decrease was more heavily weighted toward customer original equipment bookings. Backlog represents the aggregate value of booked but uncompleted customer orders and is influenced primarily by bookings, sales, cancellations and currency effects. Backlog of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2016 decrease d by $275.5 million , or 12.7% , as compared with December 31, 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $18 million (currency effects on backlog are calculated using the change in period end exchange rates). Backlog related to aftermarket orders was approximately 30% and 26% of the backlog at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. We expect to ship approximately 88% of December 31, 2016 backlog during 2017 . Backlog of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015 decreased by $531.0 million, or 19.6%, as compared with December 31, 2014. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $145 million and the impact of cancellations of 32 $118.4 million of orders booked during prior years. Order cancellations do not typically result in material negative impacts to our financial results due to the cancellation provisions of our long lead time contracts. Sales 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions) Sales $ 3,991.5 $ 4,561.0 $ 4,877.9 Sales in 2016 decrease d by $569.5 million , or 12.5% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $114 million . The decrease was more heavily weighted toward original equipment sales. Sales decreased into every region except for sales into the Middle East. Sales in 2015 decreased by $316.9 million, or 6.5%, as compared with 2014. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $433 million. The decrease was more heavily weighted towards original equipment sales. Sales decreased into every region except for sales into Europe, primarily due to the favorable impact of SIHI sales into the region. Sales in 2015 include $294.2 million sales from SIHI which do not compare to 2014. Sales to international customers, including export sales from the U.S., were approximately 64% of total sales in 2016 , 66% in 2015 and 68% in 2014 . Sales into Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMA") were approximately 35% , 34% and 32% of total sales in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Sales into Asia Pacific were approximately 18% of total sales for 2016 , 18% for 2015 and 20% for 2014 . Sales into Latin America were approximately 7% of total sales in 2016 , 9% for 2015 and 11% for 2014 . Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Gross profit $ 1,231.6 $ 1,487.3 $ 1,714.6 Gross profit margin 30.9 % 32.6 % 35.2 % Gross profit in 2016 decrease d by $255.7 million , or 17.2% , as compared with 2015 . Gross profit margin in 2016 of 30.9% decrease d from 32.6% in 2015 . The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributed to the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, unfavorable impacts of short-term operational inefficiencies related to the initial execution of certain Realignment Programs, lower margin projects that shipped from backlog and a $15.5 million charge to write down inventory in Brazil, partially offset by realignment savings achieved related to our Realignment Programs and a mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales. Aftermarket sales increased to approximately 45% of total sales, as compared with approximately 43% of total sales for the same period in 2015 . Gross profit in 2015 decreased by $227.3 million, or 13.3%, as compared with 2014. Gross profit margin in 2015 of 32.6% decreased from 35.2% in 2014. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributed to the negative impact resulting from purchase accounting adjustments on acquired SIHI backlog and inventory of $18.1 million, charges related to our Realignment Programs of $66.7 million, and to a lesser extent, certain lower margin projects that shipped from backlog and the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, as compared with the same period in 2014. The decrease was partially offset by a decrease in compensation, which included a decrease in broad-based annual incentive program compensation, and a mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales. Aftermarket sales increased to approximately 43% of total sales, as compared with approximately 42% of total sales for the same period in 2014. SG&A 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) SG&A $ 965.3 $ 971.6 $ 936.9 SG&A as a percentage of sales 24.2 % 21.3 % 19.2 % 33 SG&A in 2016 decrease d by $6.3 million , or 0.6% , as compared with 2015 . Currency effects yielded a decrease of approximately $24 million . SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2016 increase d 290 basis points as compared with the same period in 2015 due primarily to increased bad debt expense as a result of the $63.2 million reserve established for our primary Venezuelan customer in the third quarter of 2016 and lower sales leverage, partially offset by decreased charges and savings achieved related to our Realignment Programs and lower SIHI integration costs. SG&A in 2015 increased by $34.7 million, or 3.7%, as compared with 2014. Currency effects yielded a decrease of approximately $81 million. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2015 increased 210 basis points as compared with the same period in 2014 due in part to $41.2 million of charges related to our Realignment Programs, $11.6 million of SIHI acquisition-related costs, lower sales leverage, a $11.9 million increase in bad debt expense and the $13.4 million gain from the sale of the Naval business in the first quarter of 2014, partially offset by a decrease in compensation, which included a decrease in broad-based annual incentive program compensation, and a $6.8 million gain from the reversal of contingent consideration on our purchase of Innovative Mag-Drive, LLC ("Innomag"). Net Earnings from Affiliates 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions) Net earnings from affiliates $ 11.2 $ 9.9 $ 12.1 Net earnings from affiliates represents our net income from investments in eight joint ventures ( one located in each of Chile, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and India and two in China) that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Net earnings from affiliates in 2016 increase d by $1.3 million primarily as a a result of increased earnings of our EPD joint venture in South Korea and IPD joint venture in Chile. Net earnings from affiliates in 2015 decreased by $2.2 million primarily as a result of decreased earnings of our EPD joint venture in South Korea. Operating Income 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Operating income $ 277.5 $ 525.6 $ 789.8 Operating income as a percentage of sales 7.0 % 11.5 % 16.2 % Operating income in 2016 decrease d by $248.1 million , or 47.2% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease was primarily a result of the $255.7 million decrease in gross profit, partially offset by the $6.3 million decrease in SG&A discussed above. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $18 million . Operating income in 2015 decreased by $264.2 million, or 33.5%, as compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily a result of the $227.3 million decrease in gross profit and the $34.7 million increase in SG&A discussed above. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $46 million and $108.1 million of realignment expense. Interest Expense and Interest Income 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions) Interest expense $ (60.1 ) $ (65.3 ) $ (60.3 ) Interest income 2.8 2.1 1.7 Interest expense in 2016 decrease d by $5.2 million as compared with 2015 . The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased commitments and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (as such term is defined in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report) in 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. Interest expense in 2015 increased by $5.0 million as compared with 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense associated with increased borrowings in 2015 related to our public offering of 500.0 million of Euro senior notes in aggregate principal amount due March 17, 2022 (the "2022 EUR Senior Notes") issued on March 17, 2015. Interest income in 2016 increase d by $0.7 million as compared with 2015 . Interest income in 2015 increased by $0.4 million as compared with 2014. 34 Other Income (Expense), net 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions) Other income (expense), net $ 3.3 $ (40.2 ) $ 2.0 Other income, net increased $43.5 million from expense of $40.2 million in 2015 to income of $3.3 million in 2016 . The increase was primarily due to a $60.7 million decrease in losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites' functional currencies, partially offset by a $18.2 million decrease in gains from foreign exchange contracts. The net change was primarily due to the foreign currency exchange rate movements in the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016 , as compared with the same period in 2015, and the $18.5 million loss as a result of the remeasurement of our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets in the first quarter of 2015 that did not recur. Other expense, net increased $42.2 million from income of $2.0 million in 2014 to a loss of $40.2 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $57.0 million increase in losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites' functional currencies, including the impact of the $18.5 million loss as a result of the first quarter of 2015 remeasurement of our bolivar-denominated Venezuelan net monetary assets, partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in gains from foreign exchange contracts. The changes are primarily due to the foreign currency exchange rate movements of the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Euro in relation to the U.S. dollar as compared with the same period in 2014. Tax Expense and Tax Rate 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 75.3 $ 148.9 $ 208.3 Effective tax rate 33.7 % 35.3 % 28.4 % The 2016 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, tax impacts from our Realignment Programs and losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was provided. Our effective tax rate of 33.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased from 35.3% in 2015 due primarily to the tax impacts described above. The 2015 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to tax impacts of the realignment programs, the non-deductible Venezuelan exchange rate remeasurement loss, and the establishment of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in Brazil in the amount of $12.6 million, partially offset by the net impact of foreign operations, which included the impacts of lower foreign tax rates and changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions. The 2014 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which included the impacts of lower foreign tax rates and changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions. On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was signed into law, creating an exclusion from U.S. taxable income for certain types of foreign related party payments of dividends, interest, rents and royalties that, prior to 2006, had been subject to U.S. taxation. On December 18, 2015, this exclusion was further extended for five additional years. This exclusion is effective for the years 2006 through 2019, and applies to certain of our related party payments. Our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location. Changes in any of these and other factors, including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits, could impact the tax rate in future periods. As of December 31, 2016 , we have foreign tax credits of $60.0 million , expiring in 2020 through 2026 against which we recorded a valuation allowance of $0.6 million . Additionally, we have recorded other net deferred tax assets of $86.0 million , which relate to net operating losses, tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods, most of which do not have a definite expiration. Should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses, our effective tax rate would increase. 35 Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation $ 145.1 $ 267.7 $ 518.8 Net earnings per share diluted $ 1.11 $ 2.00 $ 3.76 Average diluted shares 131.0 133.8 137.8 Net earnings in 2016 decrease d by $122.6 million to $145.1 million, or to $1.11 per diluted share, as compared with 2015 . The decrease was primarily attributable to a $248.1 million decrease in operating income, partially offset by a $43.5 million increase in other income, net, a $5.2 million decrease in interest expense and a $73.6 million decrease in tax expense. Net earnings in 2015 decreased by $251.1 million to $267.7 million, or to $2.00 per diluted share, as compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $264.2 million decrease in operating income, a $42.2 million increase in other expense, net and a $5.0 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $59.4 million decrease in tax expense. Other Comprehensive Loss 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions) Other comprehensive loss $ (86.0 ) $ (158.2 ) $ (158.8 ) Other comprehensive loss in 2016 decrease d by $72.2 million to $86.0 million as compared to $158.2 million in 2015. The loss was primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting primarily from exchange rate movements of the British pound, Euro and Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2016 as compared with 2015 . Other comprehensive loss in 2015 decreased by $0.6 million to $158.2 million as compared to $158.8 million in 2014. The loss was primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting primarily from exchange rate movements of the Euro, Brazilian real and Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2015 as compared with 2014. Business Segments We conduct our operations through three business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment operating income. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our segments. The key operating results for our three business segments, EPD, IPD and FCD, are discussed below. Engineered Product Division Segment Results Our largest business segment is EPD, through which we design, manufacture, distribute and service custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals and auxiliary systems (collectively referred to as "original equipment"). EPD includes longer lead time, highly-engineered pump products, and shorter cycle engineered pumps and mechanical seals that are generally manufactured within shorter lead times. EPD also manufactures replacement parts and related equipment and provides aftermarket services. EPD primarily operates in the oil and gas, power generation, chemical, and general industries. EPD operates in 47 countries with 32 manufacturing facilities worldwide, 10 of which are located in Europe, 10 in North America, seven in Asia and five in Latin America, and it has 123 QRCs, including those co-located in manufacturing facilities and/or shared with FCD. 36 EPD 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Bookings $ 1,823.8 $ 2,065.6 $ 2,832.8 Sales 1,994.8 2,260.0 2,564.6 Gross profit 615.1 746.4 892.5 Gross profit margin 30.8 % 33.0 % 34.8 % Segment operating income 170.1 329.0 447.2 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 8.5 % 14.6 % 17.4 % Backlog (at period end) 966.8 1,157.3 1,573.3 Bookings in 2016 decrease d by $241.8 million , or 11.7% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $76 million . The decrease in customer bookings was primarily driven by the oil and gas and general industries, and to a lesser extent, the chemical industry. Customer bookings decreased $87.0 million into Europe, $52.0 million into Latin America, $38.0 million into North America, $36.4 million into the Middle East, $26.2 million into Asia Pacific and $2.6 million into Africa. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased customer original equipment bookings. Of the $1.8 billion of bookings in 2016 , approximately 48% were from oil and gas, 17% from general industries, 18% from chemical, and 17% from power generation. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) decreased $8.4 million . Bookings in 2015 decreased by $767.2 million, or 27.1%, as compared with 2014. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $228 million. The decrease in customer bookings was primarily driven by the oil and gas industry, and to a lesser extent, the chemical and general industries. Customer bookings decreased $267.5 million into North America, $226.0 million into Latin America, $149.1 million into Europe, and $92.4 million into Asia Pacific. The decrease was more heavily weighted toward customer original equipment bookings. Of the $2.1 billion of bookings in 2015, approximately 47% were from oil and gas, 19% from general industries, 17% from chemical, 15% from power generation and 2% from water management. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) decreased $18.9 million. Sales in 2016 decrease d $265.2 million, or 11.7% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $87 million. The decrease was proportionally driven by decreased original equipment and aftermarket sales, resulting from decreased customer sales of $110.2 million into Latin America, $84.3 million into North America, $27.7 million into Europe, $19.3 million into Africa, $13.5 million into Asia Pacific and $2.0 million into the Middle East. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decrease d $14.0 million . Sales in 2015 decreased $304.6 million, or 11.9%, as compared with 2014. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $258 million. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased original equipment sales, resulting from decreased customer sales of $127.4 million into Asia Pacific, $71.4 million into Latin America, $39.9 million into the Middle East, $27.8 million into Europe and $11.3 million into North America. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $10.0 million. Gross profit in 2016 decrease d by $131.3 million, or 17.6% , as compared with 2015 . G ross profit margin in 2016 of 30.8% decrease d from 33.0% in 2015 . The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, a $15.0 million charge to write down inventory in Brazil and increased charges related to our Realignment Programs, partially offset by realignment savings achieved. Gross profit in 2015 decreased by $146.1 million, or 16.4%, as compared with 2014. G ross profit margin in 2015 of 33.0% decreased from 34.8% in 2014. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the charges related to our Realignment Programs and the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, partially offset by a decrease in broad-based annual incentive program compensation. Operating income in 2016 decrease d by $158.9 million, or 48.3% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $14 million. The decrease was due to a $131.3 million decrease in gross profit, and a $29.1 million increase in SG&A (including a decrease due to currency effects of approximately $21 million ). The increase in SG&A is primarily due to increased bad debt expense as a result of EPD's $60.9 million portion of the $63.2 37 million reserve established for our primary Venezuelan customer in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by savings achieved related to our Realignment Programs and lower selling-related expenses. Operating income in 2015 decreased by $118.2 million, or 26.4%, as compared with 2014. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $28 million. The decrease was due to a $146.1 million decrease in gross profit, partially offset by a $31.0 million decrease in SG&A (including a decrease due to currency effects of approximately $49 million). The decrease in SG&A was due primarily to decreased selling and marketing-related expenses resulting from lower sales, savings associated with strategic cost reduction programs and a decrease in broad-based annual incentive program compensation, partially offset by charges related to our Realignment Programs and increased bad debt expenses. Backlog of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2016 decrease d by $190.5 million, or 16.5% , as compared with December 31, 2015 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $2 million . Backlog at December 31, 2016 included $11.7 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015 decreased by $416.0 million , or 26.4% , as compared with December 31, 2014. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $80 million. The decrease includes the impact of cancellations of orders booked during prior years. Order cancellations do not typically result in material negative impacts to our financial results due to the cancellation provisions of our long lead time contracts. Backlog at December 31, 2015 included $10.5 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Industrial Product Division Segment Results Through IPD we design, manufacture, distribute and service engineered, pre-configured industrial pumps and pump systems, including submersible motors and specialty products, collectively referred to as "original equipment." Additionally, IPD manufactures replacement parts and related equipment, and provides a full array of support services, collectively referred to as "aftermarket". IPD primarily operates in the oil and gas, chemical, water management, power generation and general industries. IPD operates 20 manufacturing facilities, five of which are located in the U.S and 10 in Europe, four in Asia, one in Latin America and it operates 32 QRCs worldwide, including 20 sites in Europe and six in the U.S. three in Latin America and three in Asia, including those co-located in manufacturing facilities. IPD 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Bookings $ 797.7 $ 887.2 $ 781.0 Sales 837.2 981.9 805.9 Gross profit 189.6 239.7 221.0 Gross profit margin 22.6 % 24.4 % 27.4 % Segment operating income 1.0 30.2 107.0 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 0.1 % 3.1 % 13.3 % Backlog (at period end) 373.5 424.6 393.9 Bookings in 2016 decrease d by $89.5 million, or 10.1% , as compared with 2015 .

Bookings decrease d $36.7 million into Asia Pacific, $19.1 million into Europe, $12.5 million into Africa, $7.7 million into Latin America and $7.2 million into North America. The decrease was driven by customer original equipment bookings. Of the $797.7 million of bookings in 2016 , approximately 44% were from general industries, 22% from chemical, 14% from oil and gas, 14% from water management and 6% from power generation. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) decrease d $7.4 million . Bookings in 2015 increased by $106.2 million, or 13.6%, as compared with 2014. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $42 million. Increased customer bookings in the chemical, general and power generation industries were partially offset by a decrease in the oil and gas and the water management industries. Bookings increased $116.1 million into Europe and $30.7 million into Asia Pacific primarily due to SIHI, partially offset by a $30.5 million decrease into North America. The increase was primarily driven by customer original equipment bookings. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) decreased $4.5 million. Of the $887.2 million of bookings in 2015, approximately 38% were from general industries, 23% from chemical, 18% from oil and gas, 13% from water management and 8% from power generation. 38 Sales in 2016 decrease d by $144.7 million, or 14.7% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $13 million and was primarily driven by customer original equipment sales. Customer sales decreased $54.8 million into Europe, $31.3 million into North America and $17.8 million into Asia Pacific, $14.5 million into the Middle East, $13.1 million into Latin America and $5.4 million into Africa. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decrease d $9.0 million . Sales in 2015 increased by $176.0 million, or 21.8%, as compared with 2014. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $50 million and was primarily driven by customer original equipment sales. Customer sales increased $151.7 million into Europe, $39.8 million into North America and $36.6 million into Asia Pacific primarily due to SIHI, partially offset by decreased sales of $29.6 million into Latin America and $22.1 million into Africa. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $0.8 million. Gross profit in 2016 decrease d by $50.1 million, or 20.9% , as compared with 2015 . Gross profit margin in 2016 of 22.6% decrease d from 24.4% in 2015 . The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, lower margin projects that shipped from backlog and the unfavorable impact of short-term operational inefficiencies related to the initial execution of certain Realignment Programs, partially offset by savings achieved related to our Realignment Programs and the reduced impact of SIHI purchase accounting adjustments in 2016. Gross profit in 2015 increased by $18.7 million, or 8.5%, as compared with 2014. Gross profit margin in 2015 of 24.4% decreased from 27.4% in 2014. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to charges related to our Realignment Programs and the negative impact of SIHI's purchase accounting adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in broad-based annual incentive program compensation. Operating income for 2016 decrease d by $29.2 million, or 96.7% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $2 million . The decrease was primarily due to the $50.1 million decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a $21.0 million decrease in SG&A related primarily to savings achieved and decreased charges related to our Realignment Programs, lower SIHI integration costs and lower selling-related expenses. Operating income for 2015 decreased by $76.8 million, or 71.8%, as compared with 2014. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $5 million. The decrease was primarily due to a $96.6 million increase in SG&A, due primarily to the inclusion of SIHI's SG&A, which included charges related to our Realignment Programs and acquisition-related costs, and increased bad debt expense, partially offset by a decrease in broad-based annual incentive compensation. Backlog of $373.5 million at December 31, 2016 decrease d by $51.1 million , or 12.0% , as compared with December 31, 2015 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $17 million . Backlog at December 31, 2016 included $14.2 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $424.6 million at December 31, 2015 decreased by $30.7 million, or 7.8%, as compared to December 31, 2014. Currency effects provided an decrease of approximately $16 million. Backlog at December 31, 2015 included $15.7 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Flow Control Division Segment Results Our second largest business segment is FCD, which designs, manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of engineered-to-order and configured-to-order isolation valves, control valves, valve automation products, boiler controls and related services. FCD leverages its experience and application know-how by offering a complete menu of engineered services to complement its expansive product portfolio. FCD has a total of 58 manufacturing facilities and QRCs in 25 countries around the world, with five of its 26 manufacturing operations located in the U.S., 13 located in Europe, seven located in Asia Pacific and one located in Latin America. Based on independent industry sources, we believe that FCD is the third largest industrial valve supplier on a global basis. 39 FCD 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Bookings $ 1,216.8 $ 1,318.5 $ 1,665.2 Sales 1,233.7 1,415.5 1,615.7 Gross profit 427.1 497.5 603.0 Gross profit margin 34.6 % 35.1 % 37.3 % Segment operating income 198.2 234.4 322.8 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 16.1 % 16.6 % 20.0 % Backlog (at period end) 584.5 622.0 774.8 Bookings in 2016 decrease d $101.7 million , or 7.7% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $22 million . The decrease in customer bookings was primarily driven by the oil and gas industry, and to a lesser extent, the general and chemical industries. Decreased customer bookings of $69.6 million into North America and $46.7 million into the Middle East were partially offset by increased bookings of $22.7 million into Europe and $6.6 million into Latin America. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased customer original equipment bookings. Of the $1.2 billion of bookings in 2016 , approximately 31% were from oil and gas, 28% from chemical, 24% from general industries, 16% from power generation and 1% from water management. Bookings in 2015 decreased $346.7 million, or 20.8%, as compared with 2014. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $107 million.

Gross profit in 2016 decrease d by $70.4 million , or 14.2% , as compared with 2015 . Gross profit margin in 2016 of 34.6% decrease d from 35.1% for the same period in 2015 . The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and lower margin projects that shipped from backlog, partially offset by savings achieved and decreased charges related to our Realignment Programs compared to the same period in 2015. Gross profit in 2015 decreased by $105.5 million, or 17.5%, as compared with 2014. Gross profit margin in 2015 of 35.1% decreased from 37.3% for the same period in 2014. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to unfavorable shift in product line mix and charges related to our Realignment Programs, partially offset by a decrease in broad-based annual incentive compensation. Operating income in 2016 decrease d by $36.2 million , or 15.4% , as compared with 2015 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $2 million . The decrease was primarily attributable to the $70.4 million decrease in gross profit, partially offset by the $34.2 million decrease in SG&A. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to savings achieved and decreased charges related to our Realignment Programs and lower selling-related expenses as compared to the same period in 2015. Operating income in 2015 decreased by $88.4 million, or 27.4%, as compared with 2014. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $14 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $105.5 million decrease in gross profit, partially offset by the $17.2 million decrease in SG&A. The decrease in SG&A was primarily driven by the 40 decrease in broad-based annual incentive compensation, partially offset by charges related to our Realignment Programs and the $13.4 million gain from the sale of the Naval business in the first quarter of 2014 that did not recur. Backlog of $584.5 million at December 31, 2016 decrease d by $37.5 million, or 6.0% , as compared with December 31, 2015 . Currency effects provided an increase of less than $1 million .

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Analysis 2016 2015 2014 (Amounts in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 227.6 $ 418.1 $ 570.2 Net cash flows used by investing activities (91.5 ) (525.3 ) (84.1 ) Net cash flows (used) provided by financing activities (130.8 ) 60.3 (366.9 ) Existing cash, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2016 was $367.2 million , compared with $366.4 million at December 31, 2015 and $450.4 million at December 31, 2014 . Our cash provided by operating activities was $227.6 million , $418.1 million and $570.2 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, which provided cash to support short-term working capital needs. Cash flow used by working capital increased in 2016 due primarily to lower accounts payable of $69.8 million and lower accrued liabilities of $97.7 million , partially offset by higher cash provided by lower accounts receivable of $37.7 million and lower inventory of $30.9 million . During 2016 , we contributed $42.5 million to our defined benefit pension plans. Working capital increased in 2015 due primarily to lower accounts payable of $113.6 million and higher inventory of $26.2 million, partially offset by lower accounts receivable of $50.4 million. During 2015 , we contributed $43.8 million to our defined benefit pension plans. Decreases in accounts receivable provided $37.7 million of cash flow in 2016 , as compared with $50.4 million in 2015 and a use of $79.7 million in 2014 . The decrease in accounts receivable in 2016 was partially attributable to lower sales during the period. As described more fully in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we estimated that our ability to fully collect the accounts receivable from our primary Venezuelan customer became less than probable and in the third quarter of 2016 we recorded a charge of $63.2 million to selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") to fully reserve for those potentially uncollectible accounts receivable. We continue to pursue payments and on-going business with our Venezuelan customer. For the fourth quarter of 2016 our days' sales outstanding ("DSO") was 75 days. DSO was 72 days for 2015 and 73 for 2014 . We have not experienced a significant increase in customer payment defaults in 2016 . Decreases in inventory provided $30.9 million of cash flow in 2016 compared with a use of $26.2 million in 2015 and a use of $35.5 million in 2014 . The source of cash from inventory in 2016 was primarily due to decreased inventory balances as a result of decreased backlog. The use of cash from inventory in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in progress billings on large orders at December 31, 2015 . Inventory turns were 3.2 times at December 31, 2016 , compared with 3.6 times for same period in both 2015 and 2014 . Our calculation of inventory turns does not reflect the impact of advanced cash received from our customers. Decreases in accounts payable used $69.8 million of cash flow in 2016 compared with $113.6 million in 2015 . Decreases in accrued liabilities and income taxes payable used $97.7 million of cash flow in 2016 compared with a source of cash of $33.4 million in 2015 . Cash flows used by investing activities were $91.5 million, $525.3 million and $84.1 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Capital expenditures represent the largest use in 2016 and were $89.7 million, $181.9 million and $132.6 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In the second quarter of 2016 we divested of a non-strategic foundry business which resulted in a cash outflow of $5.1 million and a loss of $7.7 million. Cash outflows for the same period in 2015 resulted 41 primarily from payments for the SIHI acquisition of $353.7 million. In 2017, we currently estimate capital expenditures to be between $80 million and $90 million before consideration of any acquisition activity. Cash flows used by financing activities were $130.8 million in 2016 compared with a source of cash of $60.3 million in 2015 and a use of cash of $366.9 million in 2014 . Cash outflows during 2016 resulted primarily from $97.7 million of dividend payments and $60.0 million in payments on long-term debt. Cash inflows during 2015 resulted primarily from the $526.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 EUR Senior Notes, partially offset by outflows from the repurchase of $303.7 million of our common stock, $93.7 million of dividend payments and $45.0 million in payments on long-term debt. Cash outflows during 2014 resulted primarily from the repurchase of $246.5 million of our common stock, $85.1 million of dividend payments and $40.0 million in payments on long-term debt. We have maintained our previously-announced policy of annually returning 40% to 50% of running two-year average net earnings to shareholders following attainment of the previously announced target leverage ratio. On November 13, 2014 , our Board of Directors approved a $500.0 million share repurchase authorization, which included approximately $175 million of remaining capacity under the previous share repurchase authorization. As of December 31, 2016 , we had $160.7 million of remaining capacity under our current share repurchase program. While we intend to adhere to this policy for the foreseeable future, any future returns of cash through dividends and/or share repurchases, will be reviewed individually, declared by our Board of Directors and implemented by management at its discretion, depending on our financial condition, business opportunities and market conditions at such time. In the fourth quarter of 2015, through amendment we extended the maturity of our Senior Credit Facility by two years to October 14, 2020 , lowered the sublimits for the issuance of letters of credit and reduced the commitment fee from 0.175% to 0.15% on the daily unused portions of the Senior Credit Facility. The amended Senior Credit Facility also increases the maximum permitted leverage ratio from 3.25 to 3.5 times debt to total Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility). Additionally, on March 17, 2015, we issued $500.0 million 2022 EUR Senior Notes, which bear an annual stated interest rate of 1.25%. These items are more fully described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our cash needs for the next 12 months are expected to be comparable to those of 2016 . We believe cash flows from operating activities, combined with availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and our existing cash balances, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by a decrease in the rate of general global economic growth and an extended decrease in capital spending of our customers, as well as economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for periods beyond the next 12 months. Acquisitions and Dispositions We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise economical capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this this Annual Report contains a discussion of our acquisition and disposition activity. Financing A discussion of our debt and related covenants is included in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this this Annual Report. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2016 . Certain financing arrangements contain provisions that may result in an event of default if there was a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that could result in an acceleration of payment due. Such provisions are referred to as "cross default" provisions. The Senior Credit Facility and the Senior Notes as described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report are cross-defaulted to each other. The rating agencies assign credit ratings to certain of our debt. Our access to capital markets and costs of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. In particular, a decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility. 42 Liquidity Analysis Our cash balance increased by $0.7 million to $367.2 million as of December 31, 2016 as compared with December 31, 2015 . The slight cash increase included $89.7 million in capital expenditures, $97.7 million in dividend payments and $60.0 million in payments on long-term debt, partially offset by $227.6 million in operating cash flows. Approximately 27% of our currently outstanding Term Loan Facility (as such term is defined in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report) and $33.3 million of other short-term borrowings are due to mature in 2017 and 2018 . Our Senior Credit Facility matures in October 2020. As of December 31, 2016 , we had no revolving loans and $102.6 million letters of credit outstanding under our $1.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2016 , due to a financial covenant in the Senior Credit Facility, the amount available for borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility was effectively limited to $553.5 million . Our Revolving Credit Facility is committed and held by a diversified group of financial institutions. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , as a result of increases in values of the plan assets and our contributions to the plan, our U.S. pension plan was fully-funded as defined by applicable law. After consideration of our intent to maintain fully funded status, we contributed $20.0 million to our U.S. pension plan in 2016 , excluding direct benefits paid of $2.5 million . We continue to maintain an asset allocation consistent with our strategy to maximize total return, while reducing portfolio risks through asset class diversification. At December 31, 2016 , $342.8 million of our total cash balance of $367.2 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, $228.8 million of which we consider permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Based on the expected 2017 liquidity needs of our various geographies, we currently do not anticipate the need to repatriate any permanently reinvested cash to fund domestic operations that would generate adverse tax results. However, in the event this cash is needed to fund domestic operations, we estimate the $228.8 million could be repatriated resulting in a U.S. cash tax liability between $5 million and $15 million. Should we be required to repatriate this cash, it could limit our ability to assert permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings and invested capital in future periods. OUTLOOK FOR 2017 Our future results of operations and other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross profit margin and costs, capital spending, expected cost savings from our realignment programs, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenses, potential impairment of investments, tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be affected by employee incentive compensation including our annual program and the amount, type and valuation of share-based awards granted, as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report. Our bookings were $3,760.4 million during 2016 . Because a booking represents a contract that can be, in certain circumstances, modified or canceled, and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition, there is no guarantee that bookings will result in comparable revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results. We believe lower oil prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2014 will continue to negatively impact oil and gas upstream investment most acutely and impact mid-stream and downstream investment to a lesser extent. In addition, a reduction in the overall level of spending by oil and gas companies could continue to decrease demand for our products and services. However, we believe the long-term fundamentals for this industry remain solid in spite of the current down cycle as the industry works through current excess supply with projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth. With our long-standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream, mid-stream and downstream applications, along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to assist our customers in this challenging environment. We expect a continued competitive economic environment in 2017 . Continued execution of our Realignment Programs and investments in broad-based employee incentive compensation, while providing long-term benefits, will pressure operating margins in 2017. We anticipate benefits from the continuation of our end-user strategies, the strength of our high margin aftermarket business, continued disciplined cost management, our diverse customer base, our broad product portfolio and our unified operating platform. Similar to prior years, we expect our results will be weighted towards the second half of the year. While we believe that our primary markets continue to provide opportunities, we remain cautious in our outlook for 2017 given the continuing uncertainty of capital spending in many of our markets and global economic conditions. Accordingly, 43 due to the decrease in backlog at December 31, 2016 as compared with the prior year and a continued competitive environment we expect that sales will decline between 6% to 11% in 2017. For additional discussion on our markets and our opportunities, see the "Business Overview Our Markets" section of this MD&A. On December 31, 2016 , we had $1,313.1 million of fixed-rate Senior Notes outstanding and $224.3 million of variable-rate debt under our Term Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2016 , we had no variable to fixed interest rate derivative contracts. However, because a portion of our debt carries a variable rate of interest, our debt is subject to volatility in rates, which could impact interest expense. We expect our interest expense in 2017 will be relatively consistent with amounts incurred in 2016 . Our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Annual Report. We expect to generate sufficient cash from operations and have sufficient capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt payments and pension plan contributions in 2017 . The amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues, customer cash advances, backlog, customer-driven delays and other factors. We seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory. In 2017 , our cash flows for investing activities will be focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic expansion, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and we currently estimate capital expenditures to be between $80 million and $90 million , before consideration of any acquisition activity. We have $60.0 million in scheduled principal repayments in 2017 under our Term Loan Facility, and we expect to comply with the covenants under our Senior Credit Facility in 2017 . See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our debt covenants. We currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plan will be approximately $20 million , excluding direct benefits paid, in 2017 in order to maintain fully-funded status as defined by applicable law. We currently anticipate that our contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $6 million in 2017 , excluding direct benefits paid.

As of December 31, 2016 , the gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $59.3 million . We do not expect a material payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months. We are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the uncertain tax positions. The following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at December 31, 2016 : Commitment Expiration By Period Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Beyond 5 Years Total (Amounts in millions) Letters of credit $ 287.2 $ 162.2 $ 43.6 $ 30.4 $ 523.4 Surety bonds 71.9 4.1 0.2 76.2 Total $ 359.1 $ 166.3 $ 43.8 $ 30.4 $ 599.6 We expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS Plan Descriptions We and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 65% of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately 54% of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the U.S. qualified plan as of December 31, 2016 . The assets for the U.S. qualified plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to all of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans. None of our common stock is directly held by these plans. Our U.S. defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of primarily U.S. equity and fixed income securities. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets include a significant concentration of United Kingdom ("U.K.") fixed income securities , as discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We monitor investment allocations and manage plan assets to maintain acceptable levels of risk. At December 31, 2016 , the estimated fair market value of U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans increased to $642.3 million from $639.0 million at December 31, 2015 . Assets were allocated as follows: U.S. Plan Asset category 2016 2015 U.S. Large Cap 20 % 19 % U.S. Small Cap 4 % 4 % International Large Cap 14 % 14 % Emerging Markets 5 % 5 % World Equity 8 % 8 % Equity securities 51 % 50 % Liability Driven Investment 39 % 39 % Long-Term Government/Credit 10 % 11 % Fixed income 49 % 50 % 45 Non-U.S. Plans Asset category 2016 2015 North American Companies 7 % 6 % U.K. Companies % 8 % European Companies % 3 % Asian Pacific Companies % 2 % Global Equity 8 % 8 % Equity securities 15 % 27 % U.K. Government Gilt Index 31 % 27 % U.K. Corporate Bond Index 1 % 19 % Global Fixed Income Bond 2 % 18 % Liability Driven Investment 11 % % Fixed income 45 % 64 % Multi-asset 25 % % Buy-in Contract 9 % % Other 6 % 9 % Other Types 40 % 9 % The projected benefit obligation ("Benefit Obligation") for our defined benefit pension plans was $833.5 million and $812.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants compensation and years of credited service. The estimated prior service cost and the estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2017 is approximately $0.1 million and $9.5 million , respectively. We amortize estimated prior service costs and estimated net losses over the remaining expected service period or over the remaining expected lifetime for plans with only inactive participants. We sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. These plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies. We fund the plans as benefits are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. The benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees. The Benefit Obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was $27.3 million and $28.6 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2017 is $0.1 million . The estimated prior service cost that is expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into pension expense in 2017 is $0.1 million . We amortize any estimated net loss over the remaining expected service period of approximately three years. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions We account for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. Our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We, in consultation with our actuaries, evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits, such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets for funded plans, mortality rates, retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases, and determine such assumptions as of December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. See discussion of our accounting for and assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the Our Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A. In 2016 , net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in operating income was $37.5 million compared with $40.1 million in 2015 and $45.5 million in 2014 . 46 The following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2016 : U.S. Plan Non-U.S. Plans Weighted average assumptions used to determine Benefit Obligation: Discount rate 4.00 % 2.34 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00 3.22 Weighted average assumptions used to determine 2016 net pension expense: Long-term rate of return on assets 6.00 % 4.68 % Discount rate 4.75 3.13 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.00 3.61 The following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the U.S. qualified and aggregate non-U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement plans. Effect of Discount Rate Changes and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.3 ) $ 1.3 Effect on Benefit Obligation (16.8 ) 18.2 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (2.5 ) 2.6 Effect on Benefit Obligation (26.9 ) 30.6 U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense (0.1 ) Effect on Benefit Obligation (0.9 ) 0.9 Effect of Changes in the Expected Return on Assets and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (2.0 ) $ 2.0 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (1.1 ) 1.1 As discussed below, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. At December 31, 2016 , as compared with December 31, 2015 , we decreased our discount rate for the U.S. plan from 4.75% to 4.00% based on an analysis of publicly-traded investment grade U.S. corporate bonds, which had lower yields due to current market conditions. The average discount rate for the non-U.S. plans decreased from 3.13% to 2.34% based on analysis of bonds and other publicly-traded instruments, by country, which had lower yields due to market conditions . The average assumed rate of compensation remained relatively constant at approximately 4.00% for the U.S. plan and decreased to 3.22% from 3.61% for our non-U.S. plans. To determine the 2016 pension expense, the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets decreased to 6.00% from 6.25% and we decreased our average rate of return on non-U.S. plan assets from 5.03% to 4.68% , primarily based on our target allocations and expected long-term asset returns. As the expected rate of return on plan assets is long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rate. For all U.S. plans, we adopted the RP-2006 mortality tables and the MP-2016 improvement scale published in October 2016. We applied the RP-2006 tables based on the constituency of our plan population for union and non-union participants. We adjusted the improvement scale to utilize 75% of the ultimate improvement rate, consistent with assumptions adopted by the Social Security Administration trustees, based on long-term historical experience. Currently, we believe this approach provides the best estimate of our future obligation. Most plan participants elect to receive plan benefits as a lump sum at the end of service, rather than an annuity. As such, the updated mortality tables had an immaterial effect on our pension obligation. 47 We expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately $3.5 million lower in 2017 than the $37.5 million in 2016 , primarily due to the reduction in the amortization of the actuarial net loss. We have used discount rates of 4.00% , 2.34% and 3.75% at December 31, 2016 , in calculating our estimated 2017 net pension expense for U.S. pension plans, non-U.S. pension plans and postretirement medical plans, respectively. The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were 7.5% for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , with a gradual decrease to 5.0% for 2025 and future years. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care. Plan Funding Our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs. We contributed $42.5 million , $43.8 million and $43.5 million to our defined benefit plans in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. After consideration of our intent to remain fully-funded based on standards set by law, we currently anticipate that our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2017 will be approximately $20 million , excluding direct benefits paid. We expect to contribute approximately $6 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2017 , excluding direct benefits paid. For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. The most significant estimates made by management include: timing and amount of revenue recognition; deferred taxes, tax valuation allowances and tax reserves; reserves for contingent loss; pension and postretirement benefits; and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The significant estimates are reviewed at least annually if not quarterly by management. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may differ from the estimates, and the difference may be material. Our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting estimates and policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers, which is typically based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions. In addition, our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement, a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectibility. We defer the recognition of revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and/or services have been performed. Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Our contracts typically include cancellation provisions that require customers to reimburse us for costs incurred up to the date of cancellation, as well as any contractual cancellation penalties. We enter into certain agreements with multiple deliverables that may include any combination of designing, developing, manufacturing, modifying, installing and commissioning of flow management equipment and providing services related to the performance of such products. Delivery of these products and services typically occurs within a one to two -year period, although many arrangements, such as "short-cycle" type orders, have a shorter timeframe for delivery . We separate deliverables into units of accounting based on whether the deliverable(s) have standalone value to the customer (impact of general rights of return is immaterial). Contract value is allocated ratably to the units of accounting in the arrangement based on their relative selling prices determined as if the deliverables were sold separately. Revenues for long-term contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer are recorded on the percentage of completion method with 48 progress measured on a cost-to-cost basis. Percentage of completion revenue represents less than 7% of our consolidated sales for each year presented. Revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered. Revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract. These contracts can range in duration, but generally extend for up to five years . Fixed fee service contracts represent approximately 1% of consolidated sales for each year presented. In certain instances, we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts. Failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non-recoverable costs. In instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable, we perform a project profitability analysis, accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues, which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project. In such instances, we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined. In circumstances where the total projected revenues still exceed total projected costs, the incurrence of penalties or non-recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition. Our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies. Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves We recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances, if necessary. We assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could, if successful, result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. While we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. Reserves for Contingent Loss Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable. Assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts, including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations. The recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter, changes in political environments, legal venue and other factors. Recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties, technological innovation and regulatory environment changes. Estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos-related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed, settled and dismissed, with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur. A substantial majority of our asbestos-related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities. Estimated indemnities and receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos-related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries, which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers. We have claims pending against certain insurers that, if resolved more favorably than estimated future recoveries, would result in discrete gains in the applicable quarter. We are currently unable to estimate the impact, if any, of unasserted asbestos-related claims, although future claims would also be subject to existing indemnities and insurance coverage. Changes in claims filed, settled and 49 dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, including former employees, and their beneficiaries. The assets, liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates, turnover, rates of compensation increases and other factors. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These assumptions are assessed annually in consultation with independent actuaries and investment advisors as of December 31 and adjustments are made as needed. We evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained, including appropriate rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation (health care cost trend) rates. We ensure that our significant assumptions are within the reasonable range relative to market data. The methodology to set our significant assumptions includes: Discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments. For the U.S. the discount rate is obtained from an analysis of publicly-traded investment-grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate. For plans in the U.K. and the Eurozone we use the discount rate obtained from an analysis of AA-graded corporate bonds used to generate a yield curve. For other countries or regions without a corporate AA bond market, government bond rates are used. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term high-quality debt securities, as well as the duration of our plans liabilities. The expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies, expected long-term performance of asset classes, risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. These rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates. The expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels, seniority, age and other factors. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. We evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations, cash flow requirements and other factors. We discuss our funding assumptions with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets The initial recording of goodwill and intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. We test the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. The test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units. The identification of our reporting units began at the operating segment level and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purpose of testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions. These conditions included, among other factors, (i) the extent to which a component represents a business and (ii) the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments and resulted in five reporting units. Other factors that were considered in determining whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the methods of distribution and the types of industries served. An impairment loss for goodwill is recognized if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, 50 business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. We did not record an impairment of goodwill in 2016, 2015 or 2014; however the estimated fair value of our Engineered Product Operations ("EPO") and IPD reporting units reduced significantly due to broad-based capital spending declines and heightened pricing pressure experienced in the oil and gas markets which are anticipated to continue in the near to mid-term. The EPO reporting unit is a component of our EPD reporting segment and is primarily focused on long lead time, custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems. As of December 31, 2016 our EPO reporting unit had approximately $156 million of goodwill and its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 45%. In addition, our IPD reporting unit, which is primarily focused on pre-configured industrial pumps and pump systems had approximately $298 million of goodwill and it fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 70%. Key assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of our EPO and IPD reporting units included the annual operating plan and forecasted operating results, successful execution of our current realignment programs and identified strategic initiatives, a constant cost of capital, a short-term stabilization and mid to long-term improvement of the macro-economic conditions of the oil and gas market, and a relatively stable global gross domestic product. A 100 basis point increase in our cost of capital would reduce the estimated fair values of both EPO and IPD reporting units by approximately 13%, which coupled with a prolonged down cycle of the oil and gas markets, could potentially put both reporting units' goodwill at risk of a future impairment. Although we have concluded that there is no impairment on the goodwill associated with our EPO and IPD reporting units as of December 31, 2016, we will continue to closely monitor their performance and related market conditions for future indicators of potential impairment and reassess accordingly. We also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill. Our market capitalization increased as compared with 2015 and did not indicate a potential impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2016. Impairment losses for indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a "relief from royalty" method, which estimates the fair value of a trademark by determining the present value of estimated royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that have a significant impact on the fair value and are substantially consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above. We did not record a material impairment of our trademarks in 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . The recoverable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, is reviewed when indicators of potential impairments are present. The recoverable value is based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing assumptions similar to those for goodwill. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
