Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION S You should read the following management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this A nnual R eport on Form 10-K. This management discussion and analysis is intended to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Overview Our business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service, and great value. We promote DISH branded programming packages as providing our subscribers with a better price-to-value relationship than those available from other subscription television service providers. We believe that there continues to be unsatisfied demand for high-quality, reasonably priced subscription television services. Our current revenue and profit is primarily derived from providing Pay-TV and broadband services to our subscribers. We also generate revenue from equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees, including fees for DVRs, fees for broadband equipment, equipment upgrade fees and additional outlet fees from subscribers with receivers with multiple tuners; advertising services; and fees earned from our in-home service operations. Our most significant expenses are subscriber-related expenses, which are primarily related to programming, subscriber acquisition costs and depreciation and amortization. Financial Highlights 2015 Consolidated Results of Operations and Key Operating Metrics Revenue of $15.069 billion Pay-TV ARPU of $86.79 Net income attributable to DISH Network of $ 747 million and basic earnings per share of common stock of $1. 61 Gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations of approximately 2.773 million Pay-TV SAC of $723 Loss of approximately 81,000 net Pay-TV subscribers Pay-TV churn rate of 1.71% Addition of approximately 46 ,000 net broadband subscribers Consolidated Financial Condition as of December 31, 2015 Cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities of $1.611 billion Total assets of $ 2 2.887 billion Total long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $13.756 billion 57 Table of Contents Business Segments DISH We offer P ay-TV services under the DISH brand and the Sling brand. We had 13.897 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States as of December 31, 2015 and are the nation third largest pay-TV provider. Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. To differentiate our DISH branded pay-TV service from our competitors, we introduced the Hopper whole-home DVR during 2012 and have continued to add functionality and simplicity for a more intuitive user experience. Our Hopper and Joey whole-home DVR promotes a suite of integrated features and functionality designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching TV anytime and anywhere. It also has several innovative features that a consumer can use, at his or her option, to watch and record television programming, through their televisions, Internet-connected tablets, smartphones and computers. During the first quarter 2016, we made our next generation Hopper, the Hopper 3, available to customers nationwide. Among other things, the Hopper 3 features 16 tuners, delivers an enhanced 4K Ultra HD experience, and supports up to seven TVs simultaneously. There can be no assurance that these integrated features and functionality will positively affect our results of operations or our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. In addition, we bundle broadband and telephone services with our DISH branded pay-TV services. As of December 31, 2015, we had 0.623 million broadband subscribers in the United States. Connecting our subscribers receivers to broadband service enhances the video experience and can be used by consumers to access DISH branded programming services on mobile devices. We market our wireline and satellite broadband services under the dishNET brand. Our dishNET satellite broadband service utilizes advanced technology and high-powered satellites launched by Hughes and ViaSat to provide broadband coverage nationwide. This service primarily targets rural residents that are underserved, or unserved, by wireline broadband, and provides download speeds of up to 15 Mbps and our dishNET branded wireline broadband service pro vides download speeds of up to 4 0 Mbps. Currently, satellite capacity constraints limit our ability to expand services in certain geographic areas. However, we expect these satellite capacity constraints to be mitigated when additional next-generation satellites are successfully launched by Hughes and ViaSat and placed into commercial operation, which is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2016. Sling branded pay-TV services. We market our Sling TV services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services. Our Sling TV services require an Internet connection and are available on certain streaming -capable devices including TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and smart phones. Prior to 2015, we launched our Sling International video programming service (formerly known as DishWorld), which historically represented a small percentage of our Pay-TV subscribers. Sling International now offers over 200 channels i n 18 languages. In February 2015, we launched our Sling domestic service. The Sling domestic core package consists of over 20 channels offered for a $20 monthly subscription. In addition to the core programming package, Sling domestic offers additional tiers of programming, including sports, kids, movies, world news, lifestyle and spanish language and additional premium content such as HBO, each available for an additional monthly fee. Sling TV programming is offered live and on-demand and can be replayed as programming rights permit. On June 4, 2015, we also launched our Sling Latino service. All Sling TV subscribers are included in our Pay-TV subscriber count. 58 Table of Contents Wireless DISH Network Spectrum We have invested over $5.0 billion since 2008 to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we consider our options for the commercialization of our wireless spectrum, we may incur significant additional expenses and may have to make significant investments related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and wireless network infrastructure. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. For example, on February 10, 2016, we filed an application with the FCC to potentially participate as a bidder in the upcoming A uction 1000. Auction 1000 is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. The FCC determined that bidding in Auction 1000 will be anonymous, which means that prior to and during the course of the auction, the FCC will not make public any information about a specific applicant upfront deposits or its bids. In addition, FCC rules restrict information that bidders may disclose about their participation in Auction 1000. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless DISH Network Spectrum in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American II and American III, we have made over $10.0 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, the parent company of Northstar Wireless, and in SNR HoldCo, the parent company of SNR Wireless, respectively. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted the Northstar Licenses to Northstar Wireless and the SNR Licenses to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in FCC authorizations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the applicable accounting guidance in ASC 810, Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we have consolidated these entities into our financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter 2014. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. We may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and to the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, and comply with regulations applicable to the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information . We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to develop and implement business models that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies Wir eless in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 59 Table of Contents Trends in our DISH Segment Competition Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. With respect to our DISH branded pay TV services, w e and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. Some of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers, including bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other promotional offers. In some cases, certain competitors have been able to potentially subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services. We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH branded pay-TV customers, mostly as a result of upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers and by providing retention credits. Our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period. Our Pay-TV services also face increased competition from content providers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet. Programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent and consumers are spending an increasing amount of time accessing video content via the Internet on their mobile devices. Significant changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse e f f ect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband-connected device they choose. Online content providers may cause our subscribers to disconnect our services ( cord cutting ), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages ( cord shaving ) or elect to purchase through these online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies, resulting in less revenue to us. We implement new marketing promotions from time to time that are intended to increase our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. During 2015 and early 2016, we launched various marketing promotions offering certain DISH branded pay-TV programming packages without a price increase for a limited time period . While we plan to implement other new marketing efforts, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in increasing our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. Additionally, in response to our efforts, we may face increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, more aggressive retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. Our Pay-TV subscriber base has recently been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above. There can be no assurance that our Pay-TV subscriber base will not continue to decline. In the event that our Pay-TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Programming Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices. Programming costs represent a large percentage of our Subscriber-related expenses and the largest component of our total expense. We expect these costs to continue to increase, especially for local broadcast channels and sports programming. In addition, certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation. Further , programming costs continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. Going forward, our margins may face pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms. Increases in programming costs generally cause us to increase the rates that we charge to our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our service or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our service. Additionally, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase through new and existing online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay-per-view movies, resulting in less revenue to us. 60 Table of Contents Furthermore, our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and Pay-TV churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts before they expire. Our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of multiple programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with several content provider s, including, among others, Turner Networks, 21st Century Fox and certain local network affiliates. In particular, we suffered from lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions and higher Pay-TV churn rate beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continuing in the first quarter 2015, when, among others, certain programming from 21st Century Fox, including Fox entertainment and news channels, was not available on our service. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate resulting from similar programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions and higher Pay-TV churn rates as we did beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continuing in the first quarter 2015. Operations and Customer Service While competitive factors have impacted the entire pay-TV industry, our relative performance has also been driven by issues specific to us. In the past, our subscriber growth has been adversely affected by signal theft and other forms of fraud and by our operational inefficiencies. To combat signal theft and improve the security of our broadcast system, we use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or security chips in our DBS receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content ( Security Access Devices ). We expect that future replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure. To combat other forms of fraud, among other things, we monitor our independent distributors and independent retailers adherence to our business rules. While we have made improvements in responding to and dealing with customer service issues, we continue to focus on the prevention of these issues, which is critical to our business, financial condition and results of operations. To improve our operational performance, we continue to make investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center and in-home service operations. These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, increase productivity, and allow us to scale better over the long run. We cannot be certain, however, that our spending will ultimately be successful in improving our operational performance. Changes in our Technology We have been deploying DBS receivers that utilize 8PSK modulation technology with MPEG-4 compression technology for several years. These technologies, when fully deployed, will allow improved broadcast efficiency, and therefore allow increased programming capacity. Many of our customers today, however, do not have DBS receivers that use MPEG-4 compression technology. In addition, given that all of our HD content is broadcast in MPEG-4, any growth in HD penetration will naturally accelerate our transition to these newer technologies and may increase our subscriber acquisition and retention costs. All new DBS receivers that we purchase from EchoStar have MPEG-4 compression with 8PSK modulation technology. In addition, from time to time, we change equipment for certain subscribers to make more efficient use of transponder capacity in support of HD and other initiatives. We believe that the benefit from the increase in available transponder capacity outweighs the short-term cost of these equipment changes. EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS Subscriber-related revenue . Subscriber-related revenue consists principally of revenue from basic, premium movie, local, HD programming, pay-per-view, Latino and international subscriptions; broadband services; equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees, including fees for DVRs, fees for broadband equipment, equipment upgrade fees and additional outlet fees; advertising services; fees earned from our in-home service operations and other subscriber revenue. Certain of the amounts included in Subscriber-related revenue are not recurring on a monthly basis. 61 Table of Contents Equipment sales and other revenue . Equipment sales and other revenue principally includes the non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to independent retailers and other independent distributors of our equipment. Equipment sales, services and other revenue EchoStar. Equipment sales, services and other revenue EchoStar includes revenue related to equipment sales, services, and other agreements with EchoStar. Subscriber-related expenses . Subscriber-related expenses principally include programming expenses, which represent a substantial majority of these expenses. Subscriber-related expenses also include costs for Pay-TV and broadband services incurred in connection with our in-home service and call center operations, billing costs, refurbishment and repair costs related to DBS receiver systems and broadband equipment, subscriber retention, other variable subscriber expenses and monthly wholesale fees paid to broadband providers. Satellite and transmission expenses . Satellite and transmission expenses includes the cost of leasing satellite and transponder capacity from EchoStar and the cost of digital broadcast operations provided to us by EchoStar, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, signal processing, conditional access management, telemetry, tracking and control, and other professional services. Satellite and transmission expenses also includes executory costs associated with capital leases and costs associated with transponder leases and other related services. In addition, Satellite and transmission expenses includes costs associated with our Sling TV services including, among other things, streaming delivery technology and infrastructure. Cost of sales - equipment, services and other. Cost of sales - equipment, services and other primarily includes the cost of non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to independent retailers and other independent distributors of our equipment. In addition, Cost of sales - equipment, services and other includes costs related to equipment sales, services, and other agreements with EchoStar. Subscriber acquisition costs . While we primarily lease DBS receiver systems and Broadband modem equipment, we also subsidize certain costs to attract new subscribers. Our Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of subsidized sales of DBS receiver systems to independent retailers and other independent distributors of our equipment, the cost of subsidized sales of DBS receiver systems directly by us to subscribers, including net costs related to our promotional incentives, costs related to our direct sales efforts and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising. Our Subscriber acquisition costs also includes costs associated with acquiring Sling TV subscribers including, among other things, costs related to acquisition advertising, our direct sales efforts and commissions. Pay-TV SAC. Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new Pay-TV subscriber activation, or Pay-TV SAC, and we believe presentations of Pay-TV SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. Our Pay-TV SAC is calculated as Subscriber acquisition costs, excluding Subscriber acquisition costs associated with our broadband services, plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers, divided by gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. We include all the costs of acquiring Pay-TV subscribers (e.g., subsidized and capitalized equipment) as we believe it is a more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire subscribers. We also include all new Pay-TV subscribers in our calculation, including Pay-TV subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs for Sling TV subscribers are lower than those for DISH branded pay-TV subscribers. General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, accounting and finance, including non-cash, stock-based compensation expense. It also includes outside professional fees (e.g., legal, information systems and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized primarily includes interest expense (net of capitalized interest), prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt, and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations. 62 Table of Contents Other, net. The main components of Other, net are gains and losses realized on the sale and/or conversion of marketable and non-marketable investment securities and derivative financial instruments, impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable and non-marketable strategic investments accounted for under the Fair Value Option and derivative financial instruments, and equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) attr ibutable to DISH Network less Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax plus Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized net of Interest income, Income tax (provision) benefit, net and Depreciation and amortization. This non-GAAP measure is reconciled to Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network in our discussion of Results of Operations below. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax includes the results of Blockbuster operations , which had ceased material operations as of December 31, 2013. Pay-TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, independent retailers and other independent distribution relationships in our Pay-TV subscriber count. We also provide DISH branded pay-TV service to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately equal to the retail price of our DISH America programming package, and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our Pay-TV subscriber count. Prior to 2015, we launched our Sling International video programming service , which historically represented a small percentage of our Pay-TV subscribers. During 2015, we launched our Sling dom estic and Sling Latino services. All Sling TV subscribers are included in our Pay-TV subscriber count. Sling TV subscribers receiving service for no charge, under certain new subscriber promotions, are excluded from our Pay-TV subscriber count. Sling TV subscribers are reported net of disconnects in our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. For customers who subscribe to both our DISH branded pay-TV service and our Sling branded pay-TV service s , each subscription is counted as a separate Pay-TV subscriber. Broadband subscribers. We include customers who subscribe to either our satellite broadband service or our wireline broadband service under the dishNET brand as Broadband subscribers. Each broadband customer is counted as one Broadband subscriber, regardless of whether they are also a Pay-TV subscriber. A subscriber of both our Pay-TV and broadband services is counted as one Pay-TV subscriber and one Broadband subscriber. Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber ( Pay-TV ARPU ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate Pay-TV average monthly revenue per Pay-TV subscriber, or Pay-TV ARPU, by dividing average monthly Subscriber-related revenue, excluding revenue from broadband services, for the period by our average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending Pay-TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Pay-TV average monthly subscriber churn rate ( Pay-TV churn rate ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate Pay-TV churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH branded pay-TV subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. When calculating the Pay-TV churn rate, the same methodology for calculating average number of Pay-TV subscribers is used as when calculating Pay-TV ARPU. As described above, Sling TV subscribers are reported net of disconnects in our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. Therefore, to the extent that our Sling TV subscriber base grows, our Pay-TV churn rate will be positively impacted. Adjusted free cash flow . We define adjusted free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations less Purchases of property and equipment and Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 63 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014.

We lost approximately 81,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the loss of approximately 79,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2014. The increase in net Pay-TV subscriber losses versus the same period in 2014 resulted from a higher Pay-TV churn rate discussed below, partially offset by higher gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, primarily related to the activation of Sling TV subscribers, which are reported net of disconnects. Our Sling domestic service was launched in February 2015. Our Pay-TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 1.71% compared to 1.59% for the same period in 2014. Our Pay-TV churn rate increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, as well as cord cutting. Our Pay-TV churn rate is also impacted by, among other things, the credit quality of previously acquired subscribers, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts, our ability to control p iracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we activated approximately 2.773 million gross new Pay-TV subscribers compared to approximately 2.601 million gross new Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2014, an increase of 6.6%. The increase in our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations primarily related to the activation of Sling TV subscribers, which are reported net of disconnects, partially offset by stricter customer acquisition policies for our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers (including a focus on attaining higher quality subscribers) and increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, more aggressive retention efforts , bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. Furthermore, our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations were negatively impacted by programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts during the first half of the first quarter 2015. Our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of multiple programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with several content providers, including, among others, Turner Networks, 21st Century Fox and certain local network affiliates. In particular, we suffered from lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions and higher Pay-TV churn rate beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continuing in the first quarter 2015, when, among others, certain programming from 21st Century Fox, including Fox entertainment and news channels, was not available on our service. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate resulting from similar programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions and higher Pay-TV churn rates as we did beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continuing in the first quarter 2015. We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment, and aligning the interests of certain independent third-party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service. Most of these factors have affected both gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations as well as Pay-TV churn rate. Our future gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and our Pay-TV churn rate may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue growth. Broadband subscribers. We added approximately 46 ,000 net Broadband subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the addition of approximately 141,000 net Broadband subscribers during the same period in 2014. This decrease in net Broadband subscriber additions versus the same period in 2014 resulted from lower gross new Broadband subscriber activations and a higher number of customer disconnects. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we activated approximately 237,000 and 295,000 gross new Broadband subscribers, respectively. Gross new Broadband subscriber activations declined primarily due to stricter customer acquisition policies and satellite capacity constraints in certain geographic areas. Customer disconnects were higher primarily due to a larger Broadband subscriber base during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. 65 Table of Contents Subscriber-related revenue. Subscriber -related revenue totaled $14.954 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $ 458 million or 3.2% compared to the same period in 2014. The change in Subscriber-related revenue from the same period in 2014 was primarily related to the increase in Pay-TV ARPU discussed below and increased revenue from broadband services, partially offset by a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base. Included in Subscriber-related revenue was $ 439 million and $376 million of revenue related to our broadband services for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing 2.9% and 2.6% of our total Subscriber-related revenue, respectively. Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was $86.79 during the year ended December 31, 2015 versus $83.77 during the same period in 2014. The $3.02 or 3.6% increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH branded pay-TV programming package price incr eases in February 2015 and 2014 and higher hardware related revenue. These increases were partially offset by a shift in DISH branded pay-TV programming package mix, an increase in retention credits and an increase in Sling TV subscribers. Sling TV subscribers generally have lower priced programming packages than DISH branded pay-TV subscribers. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2015 , the increase in Sling TV subscribers had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU. Subscriber-related expenses. Subscriber-related expenses totaled $8.7 83 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $4 70 million or 5. 7 % compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in Subscriber-related expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming costs and higher Broadband subscriber-related expenses due to the increase in our Broadband subscriber base, partially offset by a decrease in variable and retention costs per subscriber and a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base. The increase in programming costs was driven by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates. Included in Subscriber-related expenses was $272 million and $242 million of expense related to our broadband services for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Subscriber-related expenses represented 58.7 % and 57.4% of Subscriber-related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from higher programming costs, discussed above. In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. Our Subscriber-related expenses have and may continue to face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. In addition, our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $76 3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $70 million or 10. 1 % compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in Satellite and transmission expenses was primarily related to an increase in transmission costs associated with our Sling TV services and an increase in uplink costs and in transponder capacity leased from EchoStar , related to our DISH branded pay-TV service . Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.683 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $1 29 million or 7.1 % compared to the same period in 2014. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in Pay-TV SAC, discussed below, and a decrease in expense related to our Broadband subscriber activations. Included in Subscriber acquisition costs was $ 107 million and $136 million of expenses related to our broadband services for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Pay-TV SAC. Pay- TV SAC was $723 during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $853 during the same period in 2014, a decrease of $1 30 or 15.2 %. This change was primarily attributable to an increase in Sling TV subscriber activations and a decrease in hardware costs per activation. The decrease in hardware costs per activation was driven by a reduction in manufacturing costs for current generation Hopper receiver systems and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new DISH branded pay-TV subscriber accounts . During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH branded p ay-TV subscribers totaled $42 9 million and $543 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers resulted primarily from a decrease in hardware costs per activation, discussed above. 66 Table of Contents To remain competitive we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the Pay-TV SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Our Subscriber acquisition costs and Pay-TV SAC may materially increase in the future to the extent that we, among other things, transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies. See further information under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs. FCC auction expense. On October 1, 2015, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless notified the FCC that they would not be paying the gross winning bid amounts on certain AWS-3 Licenses. As a result, the FCC retained those AWS-3 L icenses and Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless owed the FCC an additional interim payment of approximately $516 million. See Note 15 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information . Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.000 billion during the year ended December 31 , 2015, a $78 million or 7.2% decrease compared to the same period in 2014. During the year ended December 31 , 2015, we had a decrease in depreciation expense from equipment leased to new and existing DISH branded pay-TV subscribers and from certain assets that support the DISH branded pay-TV service, which became fully depreciated during 2015. In addition, depreciation expense was lower in 2015 as a result of certain satellites transferred to EchoStar as part of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction . Impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets of $ 123 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from an impairment of the D1 sat ellite and related ground equipment. See Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized totaled $494 million during the year ended December 31 , 2015 , a decrease of $117 million or 19.2% compared to the same period in 2014. This decrease was primarily related to an increase in capitalized interest principally associated with wireless spectrum and a reduction in interest expense from debt redemptions during 2015 and 2014, partially offset by interest expense associated with the issuance in November 2014 of our 5 7/8% Senior Notes due 2024. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted the Northstar Licenses to Northstar Wireless and the SNR Licenses to SNR Wireless. We began capitalizing interest expense related to the commercialization of these wireless spectrum licenses in the fourth quarter 2015. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information . Other, net. Other, net income was $ 278 million during the year ended December 31 , 2015 , compared to expense of $69 million for the same period in 2014. The year ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by net realized and /or unrealized gains on our marketable investment securities and derivative financial instruments. The year ended December 31, 2014 was negatively impacted primarily by unrealized losses on our derivative financial instruments. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information . 67 Table of Contents Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization . Adjusted EBITDA was $2. 5 88 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015, a decreas e of $ 2 61 million or 9.1 % compared to the same period in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31 , 2015 was negatively impacted by the FCC auction expense of $516 million and an impairment charge for the D1 satellite and related ground equipment of $123 million, partially offset by the positive impact of Other, net income of $278 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31 , 2014 was negatively impacted by Other, net expense of $69 million. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements. For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (In thousands) Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,588,303 $ 2,848,837 Interest, net (474,487) (549,368) Income tax (provision) benefit, net (366,676) (276,840) Depreciation and amortization (1,000,048) (1,077,936) Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to DISH Network 747,092 944,693 Plus: Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network $ 747,092 $ 944,693 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry. Conceptually, Adjusted EBITDA measures the amount of income from continuing operations generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax (provision) benefit, net . O ur income tax provision was $367 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $277 million in 2014. The increase in the provision was related to an increase in our effective tax rate, partially offset by a decrease in Income (loss) before income taxes. Our effective tax rate during 2014 was favorably impacted by tax planning strategies related to the tax structure of certain foreign legal entities. During 2015, o ur effective tax rate was positively impacted by a $63 million credit that was previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and was released to our income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2015.

DISH lost approximately 79,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the addition of approximately 1,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2013. The decrease in net Pay-TV subscriber additions versus the same period in 2013 primarily resulted from lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts with several content providers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, DISH activated approximately 2.601 million gross new Pay-TV subscribers compared to approximately 2.666 million gross new Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2013, a decrease of 2.4%. Our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations during 2014 were negatively impacted by programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts with several content providers. In addition, our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations continue to be negatively impacted by increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, discounted promotional offers, and more aggressive retention efforts. Our Pay-TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 1.59% compared to 1.58% for the same period in 2013. Our Pay-TV churn rate continues to be adversely affected by increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing and discounted promotional offers. Our Pay-TV churn rate is also impacted by, among other things, the credit quality of previously acquired subscribers, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts with several content providers, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud, and the level of our retention efforts. Our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of multiple programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with several content providers, including, among others, Turner Networks, 21st Century Fox and certain local network affiliates. In particular, we suffered from lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions and higher Pay-TV churn rate beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continuing in the first quarter 2015, when, among others, certain programming from 21st Century Fox, including Fox entertainment and news channels, was not available on our service. Although we believe that the impact of the programming interruptions that occurred beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continued in the first quarter 2015 has now subsided, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions and Pay-TV churn rate resulting from similar programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions and higher Pay-TV churn rates as we did beginning in the fourth quarter 2014 and continuing in the first quarter 2015. Broadband subscribers. DISH gained approximately 141,000 net Broadband subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the addition of approximately 253,000 net Broadband subscribers during the same period in 2013. This decrease in net Broadband subscriber additions versus the same period in 2013 resulted from lower gross new Broadband subscriber activations and a higher number of customer disconnects. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, DISH activated approximately 295,000 and 343,000 gross new Broadband subscribers, respectively. Gross new Broadband subscriber activations declined primarily due to stricter credit policies and satellite capacity constraints in certain geographic areas. Customer disconnects were higher due to a larger Broadband subscriber base during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. Subscriber-related revenue. Subscriber-related revenue totaled $14.495 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $730 million or 5.3% compared to the same period in 2013. The change in Subscriber-related revenue from the same period in 2013 was primarily related to the increase in Pay-TV ARPU discussed below and increased revenue from broadband services. Included in Subscriber-related revenue was $376 million and $221 million of revenue related to our broadband services for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing 2.6% and 1.6% of our total Subscriber-related revenue, respectively. 70 Table of Contents Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was $83.77 during the year ended December 31, 2014 versus $80.37 during the same period in 2013. The $3.40 or 4.2% increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the programming package price increases in February 2014 and 2013 and higher hardware related revenue, partially offset by a shift in programming package mix. Subscriber-related expenses. Subscriber-related expenses totaled $8.313 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $495 million or 6.3% compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in Subscriber-related expenses was primarily attributable to higher pay-TV programming costs and higher Broadband subscriber-related expenses due to the increase in our Broadband subscriber base, partially offset by a one-time reduction in programming related expense. The increase in programming costs was driven by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates. Included in Subscriber-related expenses was $242 million and $143 million of expense related to our broadband services for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Subscriber-related expenses represented 57.4% and 56.8% of Subscriber-related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from higher pay-TV programming costs, discussed above. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $693 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $158 million or 29.4% compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in Satellite and transmission expenses was primarily related to an increase in transponder capacity leased from EchoStar as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction during the first quarter 2014. See Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information . Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.811 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $32 million or 1.7% compared to the same period in 2013. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations and a decrease in expense related to our Broadband subscriber activations. Included in Subscriber acquisition costs was $136 million and $154 million of expenses related to our broadband services for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Pay-TV SAC. Pay-TV SAC was $853 during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $866 during the same period in 2013, a decrease of $13 or 1.5%. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in hardware costs per activation, partially offset by an increase in advertising costs. The decrease in hardware costs per activation was driven by a reduction in manufacturing costs for next generation Hopper receiver systems and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new subscriber accounts. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new Pay-TV subscribers totaled $543 million and $621 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new Pay-TV subscribers primarily resulted from a decrease in hardware costs per activation as discussed above and a decrease in gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.078 billion during the year ended December 31 , 2014, a $24 million or 2.3% increase compared to the same period in 2013. During the year ended December 31 , 2014, we incurred higher depreciation expense from equipment leased primarily to new and existing subscribers with new Hopper receiver systems, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to certain satellites transferred to EchoStar as part of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction. T he year ended December 31, 2013 was negatively impacted by $53 million of additional depreciation expense as a result of the accelerated depreciable lives of certain assets designed to support the TerreStar MSS business. Impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted from an impairment of the T2 and D1 satellites. See Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Interest income. Interest income totaled $62 million during the year ended December 31 , 2014 , a decrease of $87 million or 58.5% compared to the same period in 2013. This decrease principally resulted from lower percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2014. 71 Table of Contents Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized totaled $611 million during the year ended December 31 , 2014 , a decrease of $134 million or 18.0% compared to the same period in 2013. This decrease was primarily related to an increase in capitalized interest principally associated with our wireless spectrum. The decrease was also driven by a reduction in interest expense as a result of redemptions and repurchases of debt during 2013 and 2014, partially offset by the issuance of debt in November 2014. Other, net. Other, net expense was $69 million during the year ended December 31 , 2014 , compared to income of $385 million for the same period in 2013. The year ended December 31, 2014 was negatively impacted primarily by unrealized losses on our derivative financial instruments. The year ended December 31, 2013 was positively impacted by net realized and/or unrealized gains on our marketable investment securities and derivative financial instruments. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization . Adjusted EBITDA was $2.849 billion during the year ended December 31 , 2014 , an increase of $44 million or 1.6% compared to the same period in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31 , 2013 was negatively impacted by the $438 million impairment charge for the T2 and D1 satellites , partially offset by the positive impact of Other, net income of $385 million. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements. For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 (In thousands) Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,848,837 $ 2,804,807 Interest, net (549,368) (596,120) Income tax (provision) benefit, net (276,840) (299,826) Depreciation and amortization (1,077,936) (1,054,026) Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to DISH Network 944,693 854,835 Plus: Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (47,343) Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network $ 944,693 $ 807,492 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry. Conceptually, Adjusted EBITDA measures the amount of income from continuing operations generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax (provision) benefit, net . Our income tax provision was $277 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $300 million in 2013. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in our effective tax rate, partially offset by an increase in Income (loss) before income taxes. Our effective tax rate during 2014 was favorably impacted by tax planning strategies related to the tax structure of certain foreign legal entities. Our effective tax rate during the same period in 2013 was favorably impacted by an audit settlement with the IRS related to periods prior to 2009. 72 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment Securities We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities totaled $1.611 billion compared to $9.236 billion as of December 31, 2014, a decrease of $ 7.625 billion. This decrease in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities primarily resulted from our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to the AWS-3 Licenses of $ 8.970 billion, the redemption of our 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2015 of $650 million , capital expenditures of $ 762 m illion and capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations of $353 million , partially offset by cash generated from continuing operations of $2. 436 billion, a refund from the FCC of our $400 million upfront payment related to the AWS-3 Auction and $204 million in aggregate capital contributions to Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo from Northstar Manager and SNR Management, respectively.

Debt Maturity Our 7 3/4% Senior Notes with a remaining principal balance of $650 million were redeemed on June 1, 2015. Our 7 1/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $1.5 billion were redeemed on February 1, 2016, using a substantial portion of our available cash and investment securities on hand. The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Adjusted Free Cash Flow We define adjusted free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations less Purchases of property and equipment, and Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Adjusted free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since adjusted free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations. Adjusted free cash flow can be significantly impacted from period to period by changes in operating assets and liabilities and in Purchases of property and equipment as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations and Net cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations sections, respectively, of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that adjusted free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, management timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, adjusted free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition and retention costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment, commercialization of our wireless spectrum and other factors. 73 Table of Contents The following table reconciles adjusted free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations. For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In thousands) Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations $ 2,436,080 $ 2,408,131 $ 2,309,197 Less Purchases of property and equipment (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) (1,114,377) (1,215,861) (1,253,499) Adjusted free cash flow $ 1,321,703 $ 1,192,270 $ 1,055,698 The increase in adjusted free cash flow from 2014 to 2015 of $129 million primarily resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations of $28 million and from a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) of $101 million. The decrease in Purchases of property and equipment (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) in 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenditures for equipment under our lease programs for new and existing DISH branded pay-TV and Broadband subscribers and in satellite construction, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations was primarily attributable to an increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities principally attributable to timing differences between book expense and cash payments, including income taxes. This increase was partially offset by a $390 million decrease in income from continuing operations adjusted to exclude non-cash charges for Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments, Impairment of long-lived assets, Depreciation and amortization expense and Deferred tax expense (benefit). Included in this amount is the $516 million payment related to the FCC auction expense. The increase in adjusted free cash flow from 2013 to 2014 of $137 million primarily resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations of $99 million and from a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) of $38 million. The decrease in Purchases of property and equipment (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) in 2014 was primarily attributable to a decrease in expenditures for equipment under our lease programs for new and existing Pay-TV and Broadband subscribers, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations and in satellite construction. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations was primarily attributable to a $135 million increase in income from continuing operations adjusted to exclude non-cash charges for Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments, Impairment of long-lived assets, Depreciation and amortization expense and Deferred tax expense (benefit). This increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities principally attributable to timing differences between book expense and cash payments. Cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primar ily to grow our subscriber base, expand our infrastructure , make strategic investments and repay debt obligations . For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we reported Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations of $ 2.4 36 billion, $2.408 billion, and $2.309 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations included in Adjusted free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities, acquisitions, strategic investments, including purchases and settlements of derivative financial instruments and purchases of spectrum licenses, and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we reported Net cash outflows from investing activities from continuing operations of $ 8.0 74 b illion, $984 million and $3.035 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures for new and existing DISH branded pay-TV customer equipment totaled $ 573 million, $755 million and $852 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, capital expenditures for new and existing broadband customer equipment totaled $ 25 million, $51 million and $77 million, respectively, of which $ 23 million, $48 million and $74 million was for new broadband customer equipment. 74 Table of Contents Net cash outflows from investing activities from continuing operations from 2014 to 2015 increased by $7.090 billion. The year ended December 31, 2015 was negatively impacted by cash outflows associated with our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to the AWS-3 Licenses of $8.970 billion and Purchases of property and equipment (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) of $1.114 billion, partially offset by net sales of marketable investment securities of $1.607 billion and a refund from the FCC of our $400 million upfront payment related to the AWS-3 Auction in 2015. The year ended December 31, 2014 was negatively impacted by purchases of H Block wireless spectrum licenses of $1.343 billion, AWS-3 Auction deposits of $1.320 billion and Purchases of property and equipment (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) of $1.216 billion, partially offset by net sales of marketable investment securities of $2.935 billion. The decrease in Net cash outflows from investing activities from continuing operations from 2013 to 2014 of $2.051 billion primarily related to an increase in net sales of marketable investment securities of $4.291 billion, partially offset by purchases of H Block wireless spectrum licenses of $1.343 billion during 2014 compared to $328 million during 2013 and $1.320 billion during 2014 related to AWS-3 auction deposits. Cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations. Our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long-term debt, cash used for the repurchase, redemption or payment of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, dividends paid on our Class A and Class B common stock and repurchases of our Class A common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported Net cash out flows from financing activities from continuing operations of $ 413 million . For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we reported Net cash inflows from financing activities from continuing operations of $980 million and $1.852 billion, respectively. The net cash out flows in 2015 primarily related to the redemption of our 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2015 of $650 million, partially offset by $204 million in aggregate capital contributions to Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo from Northstar Manager and SNR Management, respectively. The net cash inflows in 2014 primarily resulted from net proceeds of $1.992 billion from the issuance in November 2014 of our 5 7/8% Senior Notes due 2024, partially offset by the repurchases and redemption of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 of $1.0 billion and repurchases of our 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2015 of $100 million in open market trades. The net cash inflows in 2013 primarily resulted from net proceeds of $2.292 billion from the issuance in April 2013 of our 4 1/4% Senior Notes due 2 018 and 5 1/8% Senior Notes due 2020, partially offset by the repurchases and redemption of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 of $500 million. Operational Liquidity W e make general investments in property such as satellites, set-top boxes, information technology and facilities that support our overall business. Moreover , since we are primarily a subscriber-based company, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary. Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment. Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive , but there can be no assurances that over time we will recoup or earn a return on the upfront investment . There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time. The first factor is our Pay-TV churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current Pay-TV subscribers. As we lose Pay-TV subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced. The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our subscriber-related margins. To the extent our Subscriber-related expenses grow faster than our Subscriber-related revenue, the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced. The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers. The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with acquiring new subscribers. Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by the rate at which we make general investments and any cash flow from financing activities. 75 Table of Contents Our subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers have a significant impact on our cash flow. While fewer subscribers might translate into lower ongoing cash flow in the long-term, cash flow is actually aided, in the short-term, by the reduction in subscriber-specific investment spending. As a result, a slow-down in our business due to external or internal factors does not introduce the same level of short-term liquidity risk as it might in other industries. Subscriber Base We lost approximately 81,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the loss of approximately 79,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2014. The increase in net Pay-TV subscriber losses versus the same period in 2014 resulted from a higher Pay-TV churn rate, partially offset by higher gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, primarily related to the activation of Sling TV subscribers, which are reported net of disconnects. Our Sling domestic service was launched in February 2015. See Results of Operations above for further information . Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs We incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers, including advertising, retailer incentives, equipment subsidies, installation services, and /or new customer promotions. While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective . With respect to our DISH branded pay-TV service, w e employ business rules such as minimum credit requirements for prospective customers and contractual commitments to receive service for a minimum term . W e strive to provide outstanding customer service, to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their Pay-TV service s over longer periods of time. Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period. We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH branded pay-TV customers, mostly by upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers and by providing retention credits. As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention upgrade spending includes the cost of equipment and installation services. In certain circumstances, we also offer programming at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing for limited periods to existing customers in exchange for a contractual commitment to receive service for a minimum term. A component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move. Our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period. Seasonality Historically, the first half of the year generally produces fewer gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations than the second half of the year, as is typical in the pay-TV industry. In addition, the first and fourth quarters generally produce a lower churn rate than the second and third quarters. However, we cannot provide assurance that this will continue in the future. Satellites Operation of our DISH branded pay-TV service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming that we offer. Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity. 76 Table of Contents Security Systems Increases in theft of our signal or our competitors signals could, in addition to reducing gross new subscriber activations, also cause subscriber churn to increase. We use Security Access Devices in our DBS receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult. It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft. We expect that future replacements of Security Access Devices will be necessary to keep our system secure. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system security is compromised. Stock Repurchases Our Board of Directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock through and including December 31, 2015. On November 3, 2015, our Board of Directors extended this authorization such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock through and including December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Class A common stock under this program . During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no repurchases of our Class A common stock. Covenants and Restrictions Related to our Senior Notes The indentures related to our outstanding senior notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on the ability of DISH DBS Corporation ( DISH DBS ) and its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions on DISH DBS capital stock or repurchase DISH DBS capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets. Should we fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes could become immediately payable. The senior notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change-in-control events occur. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, DISH DBS was in compliance with the covenants. Other We are also vulnerable to fraud, particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers. While we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud, which could impact our subscriber growth and churn. Economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft, piracy and subscriber fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue. 77 Table of Contents Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2015, future maturities of our long-term debt, capital lease and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter (In thousands) Long-term debt obligations $ 13,630,996 $ 1,503,151 $ 903,170 $ 1,203,235 $ 1,403,305 $ 1,103,379 $ 7,514,756 Capital lease obligations 166,492 30,849 32,994 36,175 19,503 19,137 27,834 Interest expense on long-term debt and capital lease obligations 4,206,125 772,289 716,328 646,445 618,716 479,170 973,177 Satellite-related obligations 1,960,083 411,734 336,526 327,197 301,102 241,371 342,153 Operating lease obligations 178,918 52,305 32,960 22,563 15,623 10,040 45,427 Purchase obligations 2,325,567 1,768,934 248,443 165,584 115,814 11,892 14,900 Total $ 22,468,181 $ 4,539,262 $ 2,270,421 $ 2,401,199 $ 2,474,063 $ 1,864,989 $ 8,918,247 In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent that we procure launch and/or in-orbit insurance on our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. The table above does not include $ 33 6 million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits that were accrued, as discussed in Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. We do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months. Other than the Guarantees disclosed in Note 15 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we generally do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities. Satellite Insurance We generally do not carry commercial launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites that we use, other than certain satellites leased from third parties. We generally do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of launch or in-orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk of such failures. In light of current favorable market conditions, during January 2016, we procured commercial launch and in-orbit insurance (for a period of one year following launch) for the EchoStar XVIII satellite , which is expected to launch during the second quarter 2016 . We lease substantially all of our satellite capacity from third parties, including the vast majority of our transponder capacity from EchoStar, and we do not carry commercial insurance on any of the satellites that we lease from them. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Purchase Obligations Our 201 6 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment, broadband equipment, digital broadcast operations, transmission costs, engineering services, and other products and services related to the operation of our P ay-TV service s and broadband service . O ur purchase obligations also include certain fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, management timing of payments and inventory purchases , and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 78 Table of Contents Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. These programming commitments are not included in the Commitments table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base. I n addition, programming costs continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. Future Capital Requirements We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash , cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital. The amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies, depending on, among other things, the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2016, with the exception of the commercialization of our existing wireless spectrum licenses and potential purchase of additional wireless spectrum licenses discussed below, are expected to be driven by the costs associated with subscriber premises equipment and capital expenditures for our satellite-related obligations. These expenditures are necessa ry to operate and maintain our P ay-TV service s . Consequently, we consider them to be non-discretionary. The amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support p otential strategic initiatives that may arise from time to time. Our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time, and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or economic weakness and uncertainty. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at acceptable terms. These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position. Wireless DISH Network Spectrum. We have invested over $5.0 billion since 2008 to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we consider our options for the commercialization of our wireless spectrum, we may incur significant additional expenses and may have to make significant investments related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and wireless network infrastructure. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. For example, on February 10, 2016, we filed an application with the FCC to potentially participate as a bidder in the upcoming A uction 1000. Auction 1000 is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. The FCC determined that bidding in Auction 1000 will be anonymous, which means that prior to and during the course of the auction, the FCC will not make public any information about a specific applicant upfront deposits or its bids. In addition, FCC rules restrict information that bidders may disclose about their participation in Auction 1000. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless DISH Network Spectrum in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 79 Table of Contents DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses. Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American II and American III, we have made over $10.0 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, the parent company of Northstar Wireless, and in SNR HoldCo, the parent company of SNR Wireless, respectively. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted the Northstar Licenses to Northstar Wireless and the SNR Licenses to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in FCC authorizations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the applicable accounting guidance in ASC 810, Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we have consolidated these entities into our financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter 2014. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. We may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and to the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses, and comply with regulations applicable to the Northstar Licenses and the SNR Licenses. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information . We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to develop and implement business models that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity The ability to raise capital has generally existed for us despite economic weakness and uncertainty. While m odest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not likely impact our current operational plans , significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition . Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such diff erences may be material to our c onsolidated f inancial s tatements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Capitalized premise equipment . Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs for Pay-TV and Broadband subscribers, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, management judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Changes in estimated useful life may impact Depreciation and amortization on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). For example, if we had decreased the estimated useful life of our capitalized subscriber equipment by one year, annual 2015 depreciation expense would have increased by approximately $ 95 million. 80 Table of Contents Accounting for investments in private and publicly-traded securities . We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge in Other, net within Other Income (Expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other-than-temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying amount of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment current carrying amount , thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of long-lived assets . We review our long-lived assets and identifiable finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets which are held and used in operations, the asset would be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeded its undiscounted future net cash flows. Once an impairment is determined, the actual impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value as estimated using one of the following approaches: income, cost and/or market. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount. In that event, a loss is recorded in Impairment of long-lived assets on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group. Fair value, using the income approach, is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model that uses the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Fair value, utilizing the cost approach, is determined based on the replacement cost of the asset reduced for, among other things, depreciation and obsolescence. Fair value, utilizing the market approach, benchmarks the fair value against the carrying amount. See Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Assets which are to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. We currently evaluate our DBS satellite fleet for impairment as one asset group whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives . We evaluate the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. During 2015, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more like ly than not that the indefinite- lived asset fair value exceeds its carrying amount. In our assessment, we assess relevant qualitative factors , including macroeconomic conditions, overall financial performance, industry and market conditions, relevant company specific events, and perception of the market . When our qualitative assessment is inconclusive, further analysis is required. During 2014 and 2013 , we assessed these assets quantitatively by using one of the income, cost, and/or market approaches. While our qualitative assessment for 2015 indicated the fair value of our intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts, significant changes in our quantitative estimates of future cash flows or market data could result in a write-down of intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which will be recorded in a line item entitled Impairment of long-lived assets, on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Based on the quantitative methodology utilized in 2014 and 2013 to test for impairment, a 10% decrease in the estimated future cash flows or market value of comparable assets and/or, a 10% increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets (while all other assumptions remain unchanged) did not result in these assets being impaired. 81 Table of Contents Income taxes . Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. We periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Any such valuation allowance is recorded in either Income tax (provision) benefit, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) or Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Stockholders equity (deficit) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our consolidated results of operations. Uncertainty in tax positions . Management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law, regulations, case law, administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position. Changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our Income tax provision (benefit), net, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations. Contingent liabilities . A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if , an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period to General and administrative expenses or Litigation expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Business combinations. When we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques, including the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach. The accounting standard for business combinations requires most identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired to be recorded at estimated fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or the market approach. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. Backlog We do not have any material backlog of our products. 82 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements Revenue from Contracts with Customers. On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This converged standard on revenue recognition was issued jointly with the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). ASU 2014-09 provides a framework for revenue recognition that replaces most existing GAAP revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective. ASU 2014-09 allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected an adoption method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. The new standard could impact revenue and cost recognition for a significant number of our contracts, as well as our business processes and information technology systems. As a result, our evaluation of the effect of the new standard will likely extend over several future periods. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral on the effective date for implementation of this standard, which changed the effective date for us to January 1, 2018. Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 ( ASU 2016-01 ), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This amendment requires all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
