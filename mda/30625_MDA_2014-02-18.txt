ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Forward-Looking Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 ("Annual Report") for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our Company We believe that we are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products and services add value. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of Quick Response Centers ("QRCs"), we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. We currently employ approximately 18,000 employees in more than 50 countries. Our business model is significantly influenced by the capital spending of global infrastructure industries for the placement of new products into service and aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes. Over the past several years, we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to drive customer investments in our offerings and use of our services to replace or repair installed products. The aftermarket portion of our business also helps provide business stability during various economic periods. The aftermarket business, which is served by our network of 175 QRCs located around the globe, provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value-added services. It is generally a higher margin business compared to our original equipment business and a key component of our profitable growth strategy. Our operations are conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"): Engineered Product Division ("EPD") for long lead time, custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; Industrial Product Division ("IPD") for pre-configured engineered pumps and pump systems and related products and services; and Flow Control Division ("FCD") for engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators and controls and related services. Our business segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a high number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications that provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively. For example, our segment leadership reports to our Chief Operating Officer ("COO"), and the segments share leadership for operational support functions such as research and development, marketing and supply chain. The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, Valtek, Limitorque, Durco, Edward, Anchor/Darling and Durametallic, which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. Our products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world leading engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. We continue to build on our geographic breadth through our QRC network with the goal to be positioned as near to customers as possible for service and support in order to capture valuable aftermarket business. Along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell, install and service our equipment in remote regions, it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations. We continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products. We continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our business segments to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet 25 global customer demands. We also remain focused on improving on-time delivery and quality, while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations, through the assistance of a focused Continuous Improvement Process ("CIP") initiative. The goal of the CIP initiative, which includes lean manufacturing, six sigma business management strategy and value engineering, is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. We experienced improved bookings in 2013 as the chemical, oil and gas and general industries saw increased activity despite an environment of continued global macroeconomic uncertainty. The growth in the chemical industry was driven by Asia Pacific countries investing in their chemical processing capabilities and North America producers investing to utilize natural gas as a low-cost feedstock. We experienced a modest increase in bookings into Europe, as economic conditions in the region stabilized. In the power generation industry, we experienced a stable level of investment during 2013 due to low levels of economic growth and continued uncertainty related to environmental regulations. In 2013 , continued favorable conditions in our aftermarket business were driven by our customers' need to maintain continuing operations across several industries and the expansion of our aftermarket capabilities through our integrated solutions offerings. Our pursuit of major capital projects globally and our investments in localized customer service remain key components of our long-term growth strategy, and also provide stability during various economic periods. We believe that our commitment to localize service support capabilities close to our customers' operations through our QRC network has enabled us to grow our market share in the aftermarket portion of our business. We believe that with our customer relationships, global presence and highly-regarded technical capabilities, we will continue to have opportunities in our core industries; however, we face ongoing challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multinational presence, such as economic, political, currency and other risks. Our Markets The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the "Outlook for 2014" section included below in this MD&A. Our products and services are used in several distinct industries: oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management, and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as "general industries." Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of new capital investment depends, in turn, on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas, power generation and water management, as well as general economic conditions. These drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior. The levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment, planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process. Sales to EPC firms and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications, as are certain sales to distributors. Project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects. The quick turnaround business, which we also refer to as "short-cycle," is defined as orders that are received from the customer (booked) and shipped generally within three months of receipt. These orders are typically for more standardized, general purpose products, parts or services. Each of our three business segments generate certain levels of this type of business. In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from a large installed base of our original equipment, which requires periodic maintenance, repair and replacement parts. We use our manufacturing platform and global network of QRCs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. In geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response, we believe customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products. However, the aftermarket for standard products is competitive, as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products. As proximity of service centers, timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services, we continue to selectively expand our global QRC network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business. Oil and Gas The oil and gas industry, which represented approximately 41% of our bookings in both 2013 and 2012 , experienced an increased level of capital spending in 2013 compared to the previous year due to the need to continue building infrastructure to bring future capacity on line to meet future demand expectations. The majority of investment by the major oil companies continued to focus on upstream production activities; however, there were improved levels of spending in both mid-stream pipeline and downstream refining operations, particularly in the developing markets. Refining overcapacity remained a concern throughout 26 the year in the mature regions, as overall demand for oil remained volatile throughout the year. Aftermarket opportunities in this industry improved throughout the year in spite of deferred North American refinery maintenance activity. Our integrated solutions offering helped to offset a reduction in service-related business, as many refineries performed this work with their own personnel. The outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies. We believe oil and gas companies will continue with upstream and downstream investment plans that are in line with projections of future demand growth and the production declines of existing operations. A projected decline in demand could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of spending, which could decrease demand for our products and services. However, we believe the long-term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on current supply, projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth. With our long-standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream, mid-stream and downstream applications, along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to pursue the global opportunities in this industry. Chemical The chemical industry represented approximately 20% and 19% of our bookings in 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Capital spending in the chemical industry increased in 2013 with the expansion of existing facilities and the approval of new projects around the world. The Middle East and Asia have seen significant growth in chemical projects as countries in those regions try to access the higher margins available downstream in the petrochemical markets. Additionally, North America has seen a revival in the chemical industry, where shale gas has changed the economics of production allowing for a lower cost abundant feedstock to drive high value chemical projects. The aftermarket opportunities improved for the majority of the year with indications that the improvements will continue into 2014. Despite a strong year, the outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions. As global economies stabilize and unemployment conditions improve, a rise in consumer spending should follow. An increase in spending would drive greater demand for chemical-based products supporting improved levels of capital investment. We believe the chemical industry in the near-term will continue to invest in maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will continue investing in capital infrastructure to meet current and future indigenous demand. We believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well-positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry. Power Generation The power generation industry represented approximately 13% and 14% of our bookings in 2013 and 2012 , respectively. In 2013, the power generation industry continued to experience some softness in capital spending in the mature regions driven by the uncertainty related to environmental regulations, as well as potential regulatory impacts to the overall civilian nuclear market. In the developing regions, capital investment remained in place driven by increased demand forecasts for electricity in countries such as China and India. Global concerns about the environment continue to support an increase in desired future capacity from renewable energy sources. The majority of the active and planned construction throughout 2013 continued to utilize designs based on fossil fuels. Natural gas increased its percentage of utilization driven by market prices for gas remaining low and relatively stable. With the potential of unconventional sources of gas, such as shale gas, the power generation industry is forecasting an increased use of this form of fuel for power generation plants. We believe the outlook for the power generation industry remains favorable. Current legislative efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have an adverse effect on investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country. However, we believe that proposed methods of limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services. We believe the long-term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth, advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets. We also believe that our long-standing reputation in the power generation industry, our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods, our advancements in serving the renewable energy market and carbon capture methodologies, as well as our global service and support structure, position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry. Water Management The water management industry represented approximately 4% our bookings in both 2013 and 2012 . Although the water management industry displayed weakness in spending levels in 2013 as projects continued to be delayed, worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems, many of which require products that we offer, particularly pumps. The proportion of people living in regions that find it difficult to meet water requirements is expected to double by 2025. We believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continued investments. 27 General Industries General industries represented, in the aggregate, approximately 22% of our bookings in both 2013 and 2012 . General industries comprises a variety of different businesses, including mining and ore processing, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, none of which individually represented more than 5% of total bookings in 2013 and 2012 . General industries also includes sales to distributors, whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve. The outlook for this group of industries is heavily dependent upon the condition of global economies and consumer confidence levels. The long-term fundamentals of many of these industries remain sound, as many of the products produced by these industries are common staples of industrialized and urbanized economies. We believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide continued business opportunities. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion of our results of operations, we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have calculated currency effects by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods. Effective December 10, 2013, we acquired for inclusion in Industrial Product Division ("IPD"), Innovative Mag-Drive, LLC ("Innomag"), a privately-owned, United States ("U.S.") based company specializing in advanced sealless magnetic drive centrifugal pumps in the chemical and general industries. Effective March 28, 2013, we and our joint venture partner agreed to exit our joint venture, Audco India, Limited ( AIL ), which manufactures integrated industrial valves in India. To effect the exit Flow Control Division ("FCD") acquired 100% ownership of AIL's plug valve manufacturing business in an asset purchase and sold its 50% equity interest in AIL to the joint venture partner. Effective October 28, 2011 we acquired for inclusion in EPD, Lawrence Pumps, Inc. ("LPI"), a privately-owned, U.S.-based company specializing in the design, development and manufacture of engineered centrifugal slurry pumps for critical services within the petroleum refining, petrochemical, pulp and paper and energy markets. The results of operations of Innomag, AIL and LPI have been consolidated since the applicable acquisition dates. No pro forma information has been provided for these acquisitions due to immateriality. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Annual Report discusses the details of these acquisitions and the exit of the joint venture. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we initiated a realignment program that is discussed in Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We currently expect total realignment program charges to be $15.8 million for approved plans, of which $10.7 million has been incurred through December 31, 2013. Upon completion of our realignment program, we expect annual run rate savings of approximately $10 million. Actual savings realized could vary from expected savings, which represent management's best estimate to date. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Outlook for 2014 section included in this MD&A. Bookings and Backlog 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 4,881.4 $ 4,713.5 $ 4,661.9 Backlog (at period end) 2,556.9 2,648.9 2,690.1 We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer in regards to the manufacture, delivery, and/or support of products or the delivery of service. Bookings recorded and subsequently canceled within the same fiscal period are excluded from bookings. Bookings in 2013 increased by $167.9 million, or 3.6% , as compared with 2012 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $30 million. The increase was primarily driven by the oil and gas, chemical and general industries. The increase was more heavily weighted toward original equipment bookings. Bookings in 2012 increased by $51.6 million, or 1.1%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $204 million. The increase was primarily driven by the oil and gas and chemical industries, partially offset by declines in the power generation industry. The increase was more heavily weighted toward aftermarket bookings. The increase included the 2012 impact of IPD orders in excess of $90 million to supply offshore oil and gas platform equipment over the next five years and an order in 2011 in excess of $80 million to supply a variety of pumps for a refinery that did not recur in 2012. 28 Backlog represents the aggregate value of booked but uncompleted customer orders and is influenced primarily by bookings, sales, cancellations and currency effects. Backlog of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013 decreased by $92.0 million, or 3.5% , as compared with December 31, 2012 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $8 million (currency effects on backlog are calculated using the change in period end exchange rates). Approximately 24% of backlog at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was related to aftermarket orders. Backlog of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2012 decreased by $41.2 million, or 1.5%, as compared with December 31, 2011. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $22 million. Sales 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions) Sales $ 4,954.6 $ 4,751.3 $ 4,510.2 Sales in 2013 increased by $203.3 million, or 4.3% , as compared with 2012 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $33 million. The increase was primarily due to increased original equipment sales and was driven by increased sales into North America, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa, and were partially offset by a decrease into the Middle East. Sales in 2012 increased by $241.1 million, or 5.3%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $204 million. The increase was more heavily weighted toward original equipment sales and was driven by customer sales into North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East, partially offset by a decrease in customer sales into Europe. Sales to international customers, including export sales from the U.S., were approximately 71% of sales in both 2013 and 2012 , and 73% in 2011 . Sales to Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMA") were approximately 35% , 37% and 39% of total sales in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Sales to Asia Pacific were approximately 20% of total sales in both 2013 and 2012 and 19% of total sales in 2011 . Sales to Latin America were approximately 11% in 2013 and 10% in both 2012 and 2011 . Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Gross profit $ 1,688.1 $ 1,581.0 $ 1,513.6 Gross profit margin 34.1 % 33.3 % 33.6 % Gross profit in 2013 increased by $107.1 million, or 6.8% , as compared with 2012 . Gross profit margin in 2013 of 34.1% increased from 33.3% in 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to our execution of operational improvements and disciplined selectivity of customer bookings. Aftermarket sales decreased to approximately 40% of total sales, as compared with approximately 41% of total sales for the same period in 2012 . Gross profit in 2012 increased by $67.4 million, or 4.5%, as compared with 2011. Gross profit margin in 2012 of 33.3% decreased from 33.6% in 2011. The decrease was primarily attributed to the larger effect on revenue of certain large, lower margin projects that shipped from backlog as compared with the same period in 2011, partially offset by the effects of operational execution improvements. Aftermarket sales of approximately 41% of total sales were consistent with the same period in 2011. Selling, General and Administrative Expense ("SG&A") 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) SG&A $ 966.8 $ 922.1 $ 914.1 SG&A as a percentage of sales 19.5 % 19.4 % 20.3 % SG&A in 2013 increased by $44.7 million, or 4.8% , as compared with 2012 . Currency effects yielded a decrease of approximately $5 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the 2012 gains noted below that did not recur in 2013, increased selling-related expenses to support higher sales, and to a lesser extent, charges associated with the 2013 realignment program. SG&A as a percentage of sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 increased 10 basis points as compared with the same period in 2012 . A $10.4 million gain from the sale of our manufacturing facility in Brazil and a gain from certain legal matters, both in 2012, and neither of which recurred in 2013, were substantially offset by the favorable impact of improved SG&A leverage and continued focus on cost containment in 2013. 29 SG&A in 2012 increased by $8.0 million, or 0.9%, as compared with 2011. The increase included currency effects that yielded an decrease of approximately $28 million. Selling-related expenses and broad-based annual incentive compensation expenses primarily contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by a $10.4 million gain in EPD during the first quarter of 2012 from the sale of our manufacturing facility in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in preparation for opening a new manufacturing facility in 2013. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2012 improved 90 basis points as compared with 2011, due in part to a continued focus on cost management. Net Earnings from Affiliates 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions) Net earnings from affiliates $ 39.0 $ 17.0 $ 19.1 Net earnings from affiliates represents our net income from investments in seven joint ventures ( one located in each of Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and India and two in China) that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Net earnings from affiliates increased primarily as a result of the AIL transactions, which resulted in total pre-tax gains of $28.3 million recorded in net earnings from affiliates in 2013. Net earnings from affiliates in 2012 decreased by $2.1 million, or 11.0%, as compared with 2011, primarily due to decreased earnings of our FCD joint venture in India. Operating Income 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Operating income $ 760.3 $ 675.8 $ 618.7 Operating income as a percentage of sales 15.3 % 14.2 % 13.7 % Operating income in 2013 increased by $84.5 million, or 12.5% , as compared with 2012 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $12 million . The increase was primarily a result of the $107.1 million increase in gross profit and $28.3 million in gains from our transactions concerning the AIL joint venture discussed above, partially offset by the $44.7 million increase in SG&A discussed above. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the improvement in gross profit margin. Operating income in 2012 increased by $57.1 million, or 9.2%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $36 million. The overall net increase was primarily a result of the $67.4 million increase in gross profit. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of sales was primarily due to SG&A as a percentage of sales decreasing to 19.4% from 20.3% for the same period in 2011, partially offset by the slight decrease in gross profit margin. Interest Expense and Interest Income 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions) Interest expense $ (54.4 ) $ (43.5 ) $ (36.2 ) Interest income 1.4 1.0 1.6 Interest expense in 2013 increased by $10.9 million as compared with 2012 . The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense associated with the senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2013, and our increased short-term borrowings as compared to 2012. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for definition and discussion of our various credit resources. Interest expense in 2012 increased by $7.3 million as compared with 2011 primarily attributable to interest expense associated with increased borrowings under our Bridge Loan and senior notes and $1.3 million in unamortized deferred loan costs related to our Prior Credit Agreement that were expensed in the third quarter of 2012. At December 31, 2013 , approximately 38% of our debt was at fixed rates, including the effects of $140.0 million of notional interest rate swaps. Interest income in 2013 increased by $0.4 million as compared with 2012 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher average cash balances in 2013 as compared with 2012. Interest income in 2012 decreased by $0.6 million compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower average cash balances in 2012 as compared with 2011. 30 Other (Expense) Income, net 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions) Other (expense) income, net $ (14.3 ) $ (21.6 ) $ 3.7 Other (expense) income, net in 2013 decreased $7.3 million as compared with 2012 . The decrease was primarily due to a $6.0 million decrease in losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites functional currencies primarily due to the foreign currency exchange rate movements of the Euro, Argentinian peso, and Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. Other (expense) income, net in 2012 decreased $25.3 million to other expense, net of $21.6 million, as compared with other income, net of $3.7 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a $21.6 million increase in losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites functional currencies, as well as a $3.4 million increase in losses on foreign exchange contracts. The decrease was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate movements of the Euro and Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar. Tax Expense and Tax Rate 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 204.7 $ 160.8 $ 158.5 Effective tax rate 29.5 % 26.3 % 27.0 % The 2013 , 2012 and 2011 effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which included the impacts of lower foreign tax rates and changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions. On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was signed into law, creating an exclusion from U.S. taxable income for certain types of foreign related party payments of dividends, interest, rents and royalties that, prior to 2006, had been subject to U.S. taxation. This exclusion is effective for the years 2006 through 2013, and applies to certain of our related party payments. Our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location. Changes in any of these and other factors, including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits, could impact the tax rate in future periods. As of December 31, 2013 , we have foreign tax credits of $27.9 million , expiring in 2020 through 2023 against which we recorded a valuation allowance of $0.8 million . Additionally, we have recorded other net deferred tax assets of $27.3 million , which relate to net operating losses, tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods, most of which do not have a definite expiration. Should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses, our effective tax rate would increase. Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation $ 485.5 $ 448.3 $ 428.6 Net earnings per share diluted $ 3.41 $ 2.84 $ 2.55 Average diluted shares 142.4 158.0 168.3 Net earnings in 2013 increased by $37.2 million to $485.5 million, or to $3.41 per diluted share, as compared with 2012 . The increase was primarily attributable to an $84.5 million increase in operating income and a $7.3 million decrease in other expense, partially offset by a $10.9 million increase in interest expense and a $43.9 million increase in tax expense. Net earnings in 2012 increased by $19.7 million to $448.3 million, or to $2.84 per diluted share, as compared with 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a $57.1 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $25.3 million decrease in other income, a $7.3 million increase in interest expense and a $2.3 million increase in tax expense. 31 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions) Other comprehensive income (loss) $ 2.8 $ (8.3 ) $ (65.6 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) in 2013 increased by $11.1 million . The increase was primarily due to pension and other postretirement benefits activity, partially offset by foreign currency translation impact resulting from the weakening of the Argentinian peso, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar at December 31, 2013 as compared with December 31, 2012 . Other comprehensive loss in 2012 decreased by $57.3 million, primarily reflecting the foreign currency translation impact resulting from the strengthening of the Euro, Mexican peso and Indian rupee at December 31, 2012 as compared with December 31, 2011. Business Segments We conduct our operations through three business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment operating income. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our segments. The key operating results for our three business segments, EPD, IPD and FCD, are discussed below. Engineered Product Division Segment Results Our largest business segment is EPD, through which we design, manufacture, distribute and service custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals and auxiliary systems (collectively referred to as "original equipment"). EPD includes longer lead time, highly-engineered pump products, and shorter cycle engineered pumps and mechanical seals that are generally manufactured within shorter lead times. EPD also manufactures replacement parts and related equipment and provides a full array of replacement parts, repair and support services (collectively referred to as "aftermarket").

Bookings in 2013 increased by $101.0 million, or 4.3% , as compared with 2012 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $39 million. The increase in customer bookings was primarily driven by the oil and gas, general and chemical industries, partially offset by the water management industry. Customer bookings increased $55.7 million into Asia Pacific, $17.3 million into Latin America, $9.0 million into the Middle East and $7.8 million into North America and was primarily driven by customer original equipment bookings. Of the $2.5 billion of bookings in 2013 , approximately 50% were from oil and gas, 17% from general industries, 16% from power generation, 16% from chemical and 1% from water management. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) increased $2.9 million. Bookings in 2012 increased by $39.6 million, or 1.7%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $105 million. The increase in customer bookings was primarily driven by the chemical, oil and gas and general industries, partially offset by the power generation industry. Customer bookings increases of $80.1 million into North 32 America, $53.0 million into Asia Pacific and $47.1 million into Europe were partially offset by a decrease of $129.8 million into the Middle East. The overall net increase was driven by aftermarket bookings. The increase included the impact of an order in the first quarter of 2011 in excess of $80 million to supply a variety of pumps for a refinery in the Middle East that did not recur in 2012. Of the $2.4 billion of bookings in 2012, approximately 51% were from oil and gas, 17% from power generation, 15% from chemical, 2% from water management and 15% from general industries. The trend toward globalization is continuing to drive spending in the chemical, oil and gas and general industries in 2012. The North American pipeline business and the global fertilizer market strengthened compared to last year. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) decreased $11.2 million. Sales in 2013 increased $134.0 million, or 5.6% , as compared with 2012 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $43 million. The increase was primarily driven by increased original equipment sales, primarily resulting from increased customer sales of $88.7 million into Asia Pacific, $43.8 million into North America, $36.1 million into Africa, $36.2 million into Latin America and $12.9 million into Europe, partially offset by decreased sales of $79.7 million into the Middle East. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $1.3 million. Sales in 2012 increased $81.7 million, or 3.5%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $106 million. The increase was more heavily weighted towards aftermarket sales, primarily resulting from customer sales increases of $75.0 million into North America, $52.9 million into the Middle East and $21.1 million into Asia Pacific, partially offset by sales decreases of $28.6 million into Europe and $21.6 million into Latin America. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $17.4 million. Gross profit in 2013 increased by $50.1 million, or 6.2% , as compared with 2012 . G ross profit margin in 2013 of 33.9% was comparable with 2012. Lower costs associated with our execution of operational improvements and to a lesser extent, fewer lower margin projects that shipped from backlog, substantially offset by a sales mix shift to lower margin original equipment sales . Gross profit in 2012 increased by $7.8 million, or 1.0%, as compared with 2011. Gross profit margin in 2012 of 33.8% decreased from 34.6% in 2011. The decrease was primarily attributed to a larger effect on revenue of certain large, lower margin projects that shipped from backlog, as compared with the same period in 2011, partially offset by the effects of operational execution improvements and a sales mix shift towards higher margin aftermarket sales. Operating income in 2013 increased by $27.2 million, or 6.9% , as compared with 2012 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $8 million. The increase was due primarily to the gross profit increase of $50.1 million , partially offset by increased SG&A of $19.1 million (including a decrease due to currency effects of approximately $6 million ). The increase in SG&A was due in part to increased bad debt expense related to certain customers and included a $10.4 million gain from the sale of our manufacturing facility in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2012 that did not recur in 2013. Operating income in 2012 increased by $0.9 million, or 0.2%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $20 million. The increase was due primarily to the gross profit increase of $7.8 million, partially offset by increased SG&A of $7.4 million (including a decrease due to currency effects of approximately $13 million). The increase in SG&A included a $10.4 million gain from the sale of our manufacturing facility in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the opening a new manufacturing facility there in 2013, offset by increased SG&A costs associated with LPI, increased broad-based annual incentive compensation and increased selling-related expenses. Backlog of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2013 decreased by $88.9 million, or 6.3% , as compared with December 31, 2012 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $19 million . Backlog at December 31, 2013 included $21.6 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2012 decreased by $41.3 million, or 2.9%, as compared to December 31, 2011. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $11 million. Backlog at December 31, 2012 included $21.4 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Industrial Product Division Segment Results Through IPD we design, manufacture, distribute and service engineered, pre-configured industrial pumps and pump systems, including submersible motors and specialty products, collectively referred to as "original equipment."

Bookings in 2013 decreased by $75.2 million, or 7.8% , as compared with 2012 . This decrease included currency benefits of approximately $4 million. The decrease included the impact of orders in 2012 in excess of $90 million to supply offshore oil and gas platform equipment primarily to an end customer in Latin America. The nonrecurrence of large orders of similar size in 2013 resulted in decreased customer bookings in the oil and gas and general industries, partially offset by an increase in the power generation industry. Customer bookings decreases of $83.4 million into Latin America and $5.1 million into Africa were partially offset by increases of $8.7 million into Europe and $5.6 million into North America. The decrease was driven by customer original equipment bookings. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) decreased $5.9 million. Of the $889.1 million of bookings in 2013 , approximately 31% were from oil and gas, 29% from general industries, 18% from water management, 14% from chemical and 8% from power generation. Bookings in 2012 increased by $58.9 million, or 6.5%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $35 million.

The increase included the impact of 2012 orders in excess of $90 million to supply offshore oil and gas platform equipment over the next five years primarily to an end customer in Latin America. Customer bookings increases of $105.2 million into Latin America and $32.7 million into North America were partially offset by a decrease of $37.7 million into Europe and $22.8 million into Asia Pacific. The increase was more heavily weighted toward customer original equipment bookings. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) decreased $24.7 million. Of the $964.3 million of bookings in 2012, approximately 35% were from oil and gas, 16% from water management, 13% from chemical, 5% from power generation and 31% from general industries. In 2012, opportunities in the chemical industry were driven by inexpensive natural gas in North America and demand for product diversification in the Middle East. Additionally, stable pricing in 2012 promoted investment in both conventional and unconventional oil. Sales in 2013 decreased by $3.7 million, or 0.4% , as compared with 2012 . The decrease included currency benefits of approximately $5 million . The decrease was driven by interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above), which decreased $ 13.2 million and were partially offset by an increase in customer sales driven by original equipment sales. Increased customer sales of $31.7 million into Latin America and $13.8 million into Africa were partially offset by decreased sales of $22.5 million into the Middle East, $11.2 million into Europe and $6.0 million into Asia Pacific. Sales in 2012 increased by $75.7 million, or 8.6%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $31 million. The increase in customer sales was primarily driven by original equipment sales. Customer sales increases of $35.9 million into North America, $15.2 million into the Middle East, $14.3 million into Asia Pacific and $12.1 million into Latin America were partially offset by decreased sales of $22.7 million into Europe. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) increased $14.6 million. Gross profit in 2013 increased by $15.0 million, or 6.5% , as compared with 2012 . Gross profit margin in 2013 of 25.8% increased from 24.1% in 2012 . The increase was primarily attributable to lower manufacturing costs resulting from our execution of operational improvements. Gross profit in 2012 increased by $32.8 million, or 16.6%, as compared with 2011. Gross profit margin in 2012 of 24.1% increased from 22.5% in 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to $7.1 million of IPD recovery plan realignment charges incurred in 2011 that did not recur in 2012, lower costs resulting from operational improvements and continued realization of realignment savings, partially offset by a sales mix shift to lower margin original equipment sales. 34 Operating income for 2013 increased by $16.2 million, or 16.3% , as compared with 2012 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $1 million. The increase was due to the $15.0 million increase in gross profit and a $1.2 million decrease in SG&A. Operating income for 2012 increased by $36.6 million, or 58.2%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $4 million. The increase was due to the $32.8 million increase in gross profit discussed above and a $3.8 million decrease in SG&A. Backlog of $530.1 million at December 31, 2013 decreased by $62.9 million , or 10.6% , as compared with December 31, 2012 . Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $10 million .

The increase included currency benefits of approximately $5 million . The increase in customer bookings was primarily attributable to the oil and gas, general and chemical industries, partially offset by a decrease in the power generation industry. Increased customer bookings of $60.1 million into North America, $47.3 million into Latin America, $35.2 million into Europe and $9.6 million in to Asia Pacific were partially offset by a decrease of $16.6 million into the Middle East. The increase was primarily driven by increased customer original equipment bookings. Of the $1.7 billion of bookings in 2013 , approximately 32% were from oil and gas, 27% from chemical, 26% from general industries, 13% from power generation and 2% from water management. Bookings in 2012 decreased $76.2 million, or 4.8%, as compared with 2011. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $63 million. The decrease in customer bookings was primarily attributable to customer project delays in the oil and gas industry and fewer pulp and paper projects in general industries. Customer bookings decreases of $68.6 million into Europe and $21.9 million into Latin America were partially offset by an increase of $13.6 million into the Middle East. The decrease was more heavily weighted toward original equipment bookings. Of the $1.5 billion of bookings in 2012, approximately 29% were from oil and gas, 29% from chemical, 27% from general industries, 14% from power generation and 1% from water management. Sales in 2013 increased $58.6 million, or 3.8% , as compared with 2012 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $6 million. The increase was primarily driven by customer original equipment sales and growth in the oil and gas and power generation industries. Increased sales of $45.9 million into North America, $16.6 million into Europe and $9.6 million into the Middle East were partially offset by a decrease of $14.7 million into Asia Pacific. 35 Sales in 2012 increased $83.8 million, or 5.7%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $67 million. The increase was primarily driven by customer original equipment sales in the oil and gas and chemical industries. Sales increases of $77.8 million into Asia Pacific and $47.5 million into North America were partially offset by a decrease of $42.4 million into Europe. Gross profit in 2013 increased by $37.8 million, or 7.0% as compared with 2012 . Gross profit margin as of December 31, 2013 of 35.8% increased from 34.8% for the same period in 2012. The increase was attributable to a more favorable sales mix between original equipment and aftermarket, a shift in product line mix and continued traction of low cost sourcing and cost control initiatives. Gross profit in 2012 increased by $29.9 million, or 5.8% as compared with 2011. Gross profit margin in 2012 of 34.8% was comparable to the same period in 2011. Operating income in 2013 increased by $54.6 million, or 21.5% , as compared with 2012 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $5 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the $28.3 million in pre-tax gains realized from transactions concerning the AIL joint venture, as discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, and the $37.8 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $9.0 million increase in SG&A primarily driven by increased selling and research and development costs. Operating income in 2012 increased by $20.1 million, or 8.6%, as compared with 2011. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $12 million. The increase was principally attributable to the $29.9 million increase in gross profit noted above, partially offset by a $7.2 million increase in SG&A (including a decrease due to currency effects of approximately $11 million). Increased SG&A was primarily attributable to increased selling and research and development costs. Backlog of $769.6 million at December 31, 2013 increased by $45.7 million, or 6.3% , as compared with December 31, 2012 . Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $1 million .

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Analysis 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 487.8 $ 517.1 $ 218.2 Net cash flows used by investing activities (168.0 ) (126.4 ) (194.2 ) Net cash flows used by financing activities (255.8 ) (428.9 ) (239.0 ) Existing cash, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2013 was $363.8 million, compared with $304.3 million at December 31, 2012 and $337.4 million at December 31, 2011 . Our cash provided by operating activities was $487.8 million , $517.1 million and $218.2 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which provided cash to support short-term working capital needs. Working capital increased in 2013 due primarily to higher accounts receivable of $53.8 million . During 2013 , we contributed $46.9 million to our defined benefit pension plans. Working capital increased in 2012 due primarily to higher inventory of $72.7 million and higher accounts receivable of $35.1 million. During 2012, we contributed $28.1 million to our defined benefit pension plans. Increases in accounts receivable used $53.8 million of cash flow in 2013 , as compared with $35.1 million in 2012 and $243.1 million in 2011 . The use of cash for accounts receivable in 2013 was directly related to the overall increase in sales, and increased aging and slower collection of certain receivables in Latin America, as compared with 2012. The use of cash for accounts receivable in 2012 was primarily attributable to delays in the collection of accounts receivable due to slower than anticipated payments from certain customers. The use of cash for accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily attributable to delays in the collection of accounts receivable due to slower than anticipated payments from certain customers, relatively strong sales in December 2011, in part due to the completion of certain previously past due projects, and contractually longer payment terms in 2011. For the fourth quarter of 2013 , 2012 and 2011, our days' sales outstanding ("DSO") was 75 days. For reference purposes based on 2013 sales, a DSO 36 improvement of one day could provide approximately $15 million in cash. We have not experienced a significant increase in customer payment defaults in 2013. Decreases in inventory provided $28.6 million of cash flow in 2013 compared with uses of $72.7 million in 2012 and $139.8 million in 2011 . The cash provided from inventory in 2013 was primarily due a reduction of delayed shipments and an increase in progress billings on large orders at December 31, 2013. The use of cash for inventory in 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in progress billings on large orders at December 31, 2012 and higher raw material inventory needed to support an increased level of bookings. The use of cash for inventory in 2011 was primarily due to shipment delays and growth of short cycle orders during 2011, requiring higher raw material and work in process inventory to support end of period backlog. Inventory turns were 3.5 times at December 31, 2013 , compared with 3.2 and 3.4 times for the same period in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our calculation of inventory turns does not reflect the impact of advanced cash received from our customers. For reference purposes based on 2013 data, an improvement of one-tenth of a turn could yield approximately $24 million in cash. Cash flows used by investing activities were $168.0 million, $126.4 million and $194.2 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, due primarily to capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by cash received from the Audco India, Limited ("AIL") transaction discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Capital expenditures were $139.1 million, $135.5 million and $108.0 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. In 2013, our capital expenditures were focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic and capacity expansion, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities. Cash paid for acquisitions during 2013 was $76.8 million as compared with $4.0 million in 2012 and $90.5 million in 2011 . Additionally, in 2013 we sold our 50% equity interest in AIL to the joint venture partner for $46.2 million in cash. Cash flows used by financing activities were $255.8 million in 2013 compared with $428.9 million in 2012 and $239.0 million in 2011 . Cash outflows during 2013 resulted primarily from the repurchase of $458.3 million of our common stock and $76.9 million of dividend payments, partially offset by $298.6 million in net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. Cash outflows during 2012 resulted primarily from the repurchase of $771.9 million of our common stock, $80.0 million in net payments on long-term debt and $73.8 million of dividend payments, partially offset by $498.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. On May 31, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors endorsed a capital structure strategy designed to make our financial structure more efficient. This capital structure strategy includes: (i) targeting a long-term gross leverage ratio of 1.0x-2.0x total debt to EBITDA through the business cycle; and (ii) an expanded share repurchase program of $1.0 billion, which has subsequently been completed. We have maintained our previously-announced policy of annually returning 40% to 50% of running two-year average net earnings to shareholders following attainment of the announced target leverage ratio. On February 19, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a $750.0 million share repurchase authorization, which included approximately $193 million of remaining capacity under the previous $1.0 billion share repurchase authorization. As of December 31, 2013 , we had $384.4 million of remaining capacity under our current share repurchase program. While we intend to adhere to this policy for the foreseeable future, any future returns of cash through dividends and/or share repurchases, will be reviewed individually, declared by our Board of Directors and implemented by management at its discretion, depending on our financial condition, business opportunities and market conditions at such time. As a part of our continuing effort to execute our capital structure strategy, in the fourth quarter of 2013 we amended our existing credit agreement that provided an initial $400.0 million term loan ( Term Loan Facility ) and a revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Senior Credit Facility ). The significant amendments extended the maturity of our Senior Credit Facility by one year to October 4, 2018 , increased the Revolving Credit Facility from $850.0 million to $1.0 billion and removed the $300.0 million sublimit for the issuance of performance letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility retained its $30.0 million sublimit for swing line loans and all other significant existing terms under the credit agreement remained unchanged. This new agreement provides additional debt capacity to enhance our operating flexibility. Additionally, on November 1, 2013, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which bear an annual stated interest rate of 4.00% (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report). Our cash needs for the next 12 months are expected to be less than those of 2013, resulting from a decreased level of anticipated share repurchases and improvements in working capital management, partially offset by increased cash dividends. We believe cash flows from operating activities, combined with availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and our existing cash balances, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by a decrease in the rate of general global economic growth, as well as economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for periods beyond the next 12 months. 37 Payments for Acquisitions We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise economical capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this this Annual Report contains a discussion of acquisitions. Financing A discussion of our debt and related covenants is included in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this this Annual Report. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2013 . Certain financing arrangements contain provisions that may result in an event of default if there was a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that could result in an acceleration of payment due. Such provisions are referred to as "cross default" provisions. Each of the Senior Credit Facility, the Senior Notes and the European Letter of Credit ("LOC") Facility is cross-defaulted to the other. The rating agencies assign credit ratings to certain of our debt. Our access to capital markets and costs of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. In particular, a decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable interest payments related to our Senior Credit Facility. These agreements are more fully described in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, and in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" below. Liquidity Analysis Our cash balance increased by $59.6 million to $363.8 million as of December 31, 2013 as compared with December 31, 2012 . The cash increase included $487.8 million in operating cash flows, $298.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and $46.2 million in proceeds from the sale of our 50% equity interest in AIL, partially offset by $458.3 million of share repurchases, $139.1 million in capital expenditures, $76.9 million in dividend payments and $76.8 million in acquisition payments. Approximately 11% of our Term Loan Facility is due to mature in 2014 and approximately 12% in 2015 . Our Senior Credit Facility matures in October 2018. After the effects of $140.0 million of notional interest rate swaps, approximately 38% of our Term Loan Facility was at fixed rates at December 31, 2013 . As of December 31, 2013 , we had a borrowing capacity of $893.9 million on our $1.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility (including outstanding letters of credit). Our Revolving Credit Facility is committed and held by a diversified group of financial institutions. In the third quarter of 2013 we elected not to renew our European LOC facility. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, as a result of increases in values of the plan assets and our contributions to the plan, our U.S. pension plan was fully-funded as defined by applicable law. After consideration of our intent to maintain fully funded status, we contributed $20.0 million to our U.S. pension plan in 2013, excluding direct benefits paid of $4.2 million . We continue to maintain an asset allocation consistent with our strategy to maximize total return, while reducing portfolio risks through asset class diversification. At December 31, 2013, $334.0 million of our total cash balance of $363.8 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, $257.7 million of which we consider permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Based on the expected 2013 liquidity needs of our various geographies, we currently do not anticipate the need to repatriate any permanently reinvested cash to fund domestic operations that would generate adverse tax results. However, in the event this cash is needed to fund domestic operations, we estimate the $257.7 million could be repatriated resulting in a U.S. cash tax liability between $5 million and $15 million. Should we be required to repatriate this cash, it could limit our ability to assert permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings and invested capital in future periods. OUTLOOK FOR 2014 Our future results of operations and other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross profit margin and costs, capital spending, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenses, potential impairment of investments, tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount, type and valuation of share-based awards granted, as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover. In addition to the various important 38 factors discussed above, a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report. Our bookings were $4,881.4 million during 2013 . Because a booking represents a contract that can be, in certain circumstances, modified or canceled, and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition, there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in a comparable increase in revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results. We expect a continued competitive economic environment in 2014; however, we anticipate benefits from the continuation of our end-user strategy, the strength of our high margin aftermarket business, continued disciplined cost management, our diverse customer base, our broad product portfolio and our unified operating platform. Similar to prior years, we expect our results will be weighted towards the second half of the year. While we believe that our primary markets continue to provide opportunities, we remain cautious in our outlook for 2014 given the continuing uncertainty of global economic conditions. For additional discussion on our markets and our opportunities, see the "Business Overview Our Markets" section of this MD&A. On December 31, 2013 , we had $796.9 million of fixed-rate Senior Notes outstanding and $370.0 million of variable-rate debt under our Senior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2013, we had $140.0 million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of variable interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. However, because a portion of our debt carries a variable rate of interest, our debt is subject to volatility in rates, which could impact interest expense. We expect our interest expense in 2014 will be higher than 2013 due to our increased level of debt. Our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Annual Report. We expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt payments and pension plan contributions in 2014 . The amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues, customer cash advances, backlog, customer-driven delays and other factors. We seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory. In 2014, our cash flows for investing activities will be focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic expansion, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and we expect capital expenditures to be between $130 million and $140 million , before consideration of any potential acquisition activity. We have $40.0 million in scheduled principal repayments in 2014 under our Senior Credit Facility, and we expect to comply with the covenants under our Senior Credit Facility in 2014 . See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our debt covenants. We currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plan will be approximately $20 million, excluding direct benefits paid, in 2014 in order to maintain fully-funded status as defined by applicable law. We currently anticipate that our contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $13 million in 2014 , excluding direct benefits paid. 39 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2013 : Payments Due By Period Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Beyond 5 Years Total (Amounts in millions) Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes $ 40.0 $ 105.0 $ 225.0 $ 796.9 $ 1,166.9 Fixed interest payments(1) 29.9 59.0 59.0 123.4 271.3 Variable interest payments(2) 5.4 8.8 4.8 19.0 Other debt and capital lease obligations 32.7 0.7 33.4 Operating leases 54.1 75.5 45.6 47.0 222.2 Purchase obligations:(3) Inventory 503.9 10.0 2.5 0.1 516.5 Non-inventory 44.1 0.7 44.8 Pension and postretirement benefits(4) 55.4 112.6 121.1 322.6 611.7 Total $ 765.5 $ 372.3 $ 458.0 $ 1,290.0 $ 2,885.8 _______________________________________ (1) Fixed interest payments represent net incremental payments under interest rate swap agreements related to the interest payments on the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility as defined in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

We are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the uncertain tax positions. The following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at December 31, 2013 : Commitment Expiration By Period Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Beyond 5 Years Total (Amounts in millions) Letters of credit $ 484.2 $ 167.2 $ 40.0 $ 11.8 $ 703.2 Surety bonds 68.5 25.4 93.9 Total $ 552.7 $ 192.6 $ 40.0 $ 11.8 $ 797.1 We expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS Plan Descriptions We and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 68% of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately 53% of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the U.S. qualified plan as of December 31, 2013 . The assets for the U.S. qualified plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to all of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans. None of our common stock is directly held by these plans. 40 Our U.S. defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of primarily U.S. equity and fixed income securities. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets include a significant concentration of United Kingdom ("U.K.") equity and fixed income securities. In addition, certain of our defined benefit plans hold investments in European equity and fixed income securities as discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We monitor investment allocations and manage plan assets to maintain acceptable levels of risk. Benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants compensation and years of credited service. Assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2013 , the estimated fair market value of U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans increased to $605.5 million from $553.4 million at December 31, 2012 . Assets were allocated as follows: U.S. Plan Asset category 2013 2012 U.S. Large Cap 20 % 28 % U.S. Small Cap 4 % 4 % International Large Cap 14 % 14 % Emerging Markets 5 % 4 % World Equity 8 % 0 % Equity securities 51 % 50 % Liability Driven Investment 39 % 0 % Long-Term Government/Credit 10 % 21 % Intermediate Bond 0 % 29 % Fixed income 49 % 50 % Other(1) 0 % 0 % _______________________________________ (1) Less than 1% of holdings are in Other category in 2013. Non-U.S. Plans Asset category 2013 2012 North American Companies 3 % 5 % U.K. Companies 10 % 19 % European Companies 4 % 6 % Asian Pacific Companies 3 % 5 % Global Equity 8 % 1 % Equity securities 28 % 36 % U.K. Government Gilt Index 28 % 21 % U.K. Corporate Bond Index 21 % 19 % Global Fixed Income Bond 20 % 22 % Fixed income 69 % 62 % Other 3 % 2 % The projected benefit obligation ("Benefit Obligation") for our defined benefit pension plans was $769.2 million and $763.9 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The estimated prior service cost and the estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2014 is less than $0.5 million and $15.1 million, respectively. We amortize estimated prior service costs and estimated net losses over the remaining expected service period or over the remaining expected lifetime for plans with only inactive participants. We sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. These plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies. We fund the plans as benefits are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment 41 strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. The benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees. The Benefit Obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was $31.5 million and $35.0 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The estimated actuarial net gain for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2014 is $1.4 million. No estimated prior service benefit or cost is expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into pension expense in 2014. We amortize any estimated net gain over the remaining expected service period of approximately three years. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions We account for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. Our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We, in consultation with our actuaries, evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits, such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets for funded plans, mortality rates, retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases, and determine such assumptions as of December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. See discussion of our accounting for and assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the Our Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A. In 2013 , net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in operating income was $50.5 million compared with $41.4 million in 2012 and $37.8 million in 2011 . The following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2013 : U.S. Plan Non-U.S. Plans Weighted average assumptions used to determine Benefit Obligation: Discount rate 4.50 % 4.22 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.25 3.83 Weighted average assumptions used to determine 2013 net pension expense: Long-term rate of return on assets 6.00 % 5.49 % Discount rate 3.75 4.16 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.25 3.84 The following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the U.S. qualified and aggregate non-U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement plans. Effect of Discount Rate Changes and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.1 ) $ 1.2 Effect on Benefit Obligation (16.2 ) 17.5 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (2.5 ) 2.7 Effect on Benefit Obligation (27.0 ) 30.7 U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense (0.2 ) 0.1 Effect on Benefit Obligation (1.1 ) 1.1 42 Effect of Changes in the Expected Return on Assets and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.7 ) $ 1.7 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (0.8 ) 0.8 As discussed below, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. At December 31, 2013 , as compared with December 31, 2012 , we increased our discount rate for the U.S. plan from 3.75% to 4.50% based on an analysis of publicly-traded investment grade U.S. corporate bonds, which had a higher yield due to current market conditions. The average discount rate for the non-U.S. plans increased slightly from 4.16% to 4.22% based primarily on rates remaining steady in the Eurozone, U.K. and Venezuela while all other non-U.S. countries discount rates increased. The average assumed rate of compensation remained constant at 4.25% for the U.S. plan and decreased slightly from 3.84% to 3.83% for our non-U.S. plans. To determine the 2013 pension expense, the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets decreased from 6.25% to 6.00% and we decreased our average rate of return on non-U.S. plan assets from 5.78% to 5.49% , primarily as a result of our target asset allocations and expected long-term asset returns. As the expected rate of return on plan assets is long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rate. We expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately $6 million lower in 2014 than the $50.5 million in 2013 , primarily due to the reduction in the amortization of the actuarial net loss. We have used discount rates of 4.50% , 4.22% and 4.00% at December 31, 2013 , in calculating our estimated 2014 net pension expense for U.S. pension plans, non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement plans, respectively. The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were 7.5% for 2013 , 8.0% for 2012 and 8.5% for 2011 , with a gradual decrease to 5.0% for 2032 and future years. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care. Plan Funding Our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs. Including direct benefits, we contributed $46.9 million, $28.1 million and $27.0 million to our defined benefit plans in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. After consideration of our intent to remain fully-funded based on standards set by law, we currently anticipate that our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2014 will be approximately $20 million, excluding direct benefits paid. We expect to contribute approximately $13 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2014 , excluding direct benefits paid. For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. The most significant estimates made by management include: timing and amount of revenue recognition; deferred taxes, tax valuation allowances and tax reserves; reserves for contingent losses; pension and postretirement benefits; and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may differ from the estimates, and the difference may be material. Our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting estimates and policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 43 Revenue Recognition Revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers, which is typically based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions. In addition, our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement, a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectability. We defer the recognition of revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and/or services have been performed. Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Our contracts typically include cancellation provisions that require customers to reimburse us for costs incurred up to the date of cancellation, as well as any contractual cancellation penalties. We enter into certain agreements with multiple deliverables that may include any combination of designing, developing, manufacturing, modifying, installing and commissioning of flow management equipment and providing services related to the performance of such products. Delivery of these products and services typically occurs within a one to two-year period , although many arrangements, such as "short-cycle" type orders, have a shorter timeframe for delivery . We separate deliverables into units of accounting based on whether the deliverable(s) have standalone value to the customer (impact of general rights of return is immaterial). Contract value is allocated ratably to the units of accounting in the arrangement based on their relative selling prices determined as if the deliverables were sold separately. Revenues for long-term contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost-to-cost basis. Percentage of completion revenue represents less than 7% of our consolidated sales for each year presented. Revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered. Revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract. These contracts can range in duration, but generally extend for up to five years . Fixed fee service contracts represent approximately 1% of consolidated sales for each year presented. In certain instances, we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts. Failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non-recoverable costs. In instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable, we perform a project profitability analysis, accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues, which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project. In such instances, we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined. In circumstances where the total projected revenues still exceed total projected costs, the incurrence of penalties or non-recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition. Our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies. Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves We recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances, if necessary. We assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could, if successful, result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. While we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. 44 Reserves for Contingent Loss Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable. Assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts, including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations. The recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter, changes in political environments, legal venue and other factors. Recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties, technological innovation and regulatory environment changes. Estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos-related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed, settled and dismissed, with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur. A substantial majority of our asbestos-related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities. Estimated indemnities and receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos-related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries, which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers. We have claims pending against certain insurers that, if resolved more favorably than estimated future recoveries, would result in discrete gains in the applicable quarter. We are currently unable to estimate the impact, if any, of unasserted asbestos-related claims, although future claims would also be subject to existing indemnities and insurance coverage. Changes in claims filed, settled and dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, including former employees, and their beneficiaries. The assets, liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates, turnover, rates of compensation increases and other factors. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These assumptions are assessed annually in consultation with independent actuaries and investment advisors as of December 31 and adjustments are made as needed. We evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained, including appropriate rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation (health care cost trend) rates. We ensure that our significant assumptions are within the reasonable range relative to market data. The methodology to set our significant assumptions includes: Discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments. For the U.S. the discount rate is obtained from an analysis of publicly-traded investment-grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate. For plans in the United Kingdom and the Eurozone we use the discount rate obtained from an analysis of AA-graded corporate bonds used to generate a yield curve. For other countries or regions without a corporate AA bond market, government bond rates are used. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term high-quality debt securities, as well as the duration of our plans liabilities. The expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies, expected long-term performance of asset classes, risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. These rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates. The expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels, seniority, age and other factors. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. We evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations, cash flow requirements and other factors. We discuss our funding assumptions with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. 45 Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets The initial recording of goodwill and intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. We test the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. The test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units. The identification of our reporting units began at the operating segment level and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purpose of testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions. These conditions included, among other factors, (i) the extent to which a component represents a business and (ii) the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments and resulted in eight reporting units. Other factors that were considered in determining whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the methods of distribution and the types of industries served. An impairment loss for goodwill is recognized if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. We did not record an impairment of goodwill in 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . The fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values at December 31, 2013. We also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill. Our market capitalization increased as compared with 2012 and did not indicate a potential impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2013 . Impairment losses for indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a "relief from royalty" method, which estimates the fair value of a trademark by determining the present value of estimated royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that have a significant impact on the fair value and are substantially consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above. We did not record a material impairment of our trademarks in 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . The recoverable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, is reviewed when indicators of potential impairments are present. The recoverable value is based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing assumptions similar to those for goodwill. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS We have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
