ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont or the Company ). References to A$ refer to Australian currency, CDN$ to Canadian currency, CHF to Swiss currency, NZD$ to New Zealand currency, IDR to Indonesian currency and or $ to United States currency. This discussion addresses matters we consider important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2005, as well as our future results. It consists of the following subsections: Overview, which provides a brief summary of our consolidated results and financial position and the primary factors affecting those results, as well as a summary of our expectations for 2006; Accounting Changes, which provides a discussion of recent changes to our accounting policies that have affected our consolidated results and financial position; Critical Accounting Policies, which provides an analysis of the accounting policies we consider critical because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses in our consolidated financial statements and/or because they require difficult, subjective or complex judgments by our management; Consolidated Financial Results, which includes a discussion of our consolidated financial results for the last three years; Results of Operations, which sets forth an analysis of the operating results for the last three years, the Merchant Banking Segment and the Exploration Segment; Recent Accounting Pronouncements, which summarizes recently published authoritative accounting guidance, how it might apply to us and how it might affect our future results; and Liquidity and Capital Resources, which contains a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, investing activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Overview Newmont is one of the world largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties. We have operations in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Uzbekistan, Bolivia, New Zealand and Mexico. We have two development projects in Ghana, which is expected to become our next core operating district. During the last several years we have expanded our global footprint through our exploration efforts and through the acquisition of operating and development assets. We face key risks associated with our business. One of the most significant risks is fluctuation in the prices of gold and copper, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Other challenges we face include production cost increases and social and environmental issues. Operating costs at our operations are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grades, metallurgy, revisions to mine plans and changes in accounting principles. At foreign locations, such costs are also influenced by currency fluctuations that may affect our U.S. dollar operating costs. In addition, we must continually replace reserves depleted by production. Depleted reserves must be replaced by expanding known ore bodies, by acquisition or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term. 37 Table of Contents Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance The table below highlights key financial and operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Sales gold, net $ 3,734 $ 3,625 $ 3,059 Sales copper, net $ 672 $ 786 N/A Consolidated gold ounces sold 8,552.0 8,828.9 8,377.4 Consolidated copper pounds sold 572.7 683.3 N/A Average price received (1) Gold ($/oz) $ 441 $ 412 $ 365 Copper ($/lb) $ 1.45 $ 1.33 N/A Costs applicable to sales (2) Gold ($/oz) $ 236 $ 216 $ 195 Copper ($/lb) $ 0.53 $ 0.45 N/A Income from continuing operations $ 374 $ 453 $ 511 Income from continuing operations per share, basic $ 0.84 $ 1.02 $ 1.24 (1) Before treatment and refining charges. (2) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization. Consolidated Financial Performance Gold revenues increased 3% in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to higher gold prices, partially offset by lower gold sales. Gold sold decreased to 8.6 million ounces in 2005 from 8.8 million ounces in 2004, primarily due to lower production and sales in Nevada and the dispositions of Ovacik and Bronzewing in 2004. Copper revenues decreased 15% in 2005 from 2004 due to a 16% decrease in copper pounds sold at Batu Hijau and higher treatment and refining charges, partially offset by a 9% increase in the average realized price (see Results of Operations below). The gold price increases over the last few years were partially offset by higher production costs and fewer gold ounces sold. During the same period, Newmont has seen significant increases in the costs of fuel, power and other bulk consumables. In addition, our production costs were affected by increases in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. While a weaker U.S. dollar generally benefits the gold price, which is quoted in U.S. dollars, it also results in higher costs quoted in U.S. dollars at certain of our foreign operations. We experienced appreciation of 5% between 2005 and 2004 and 13% between 2004 and 2003 in the average Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. In addition, our financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005 were impacted by the following: Impairment of the Nevada reporting unit goodwill ($41); Significantly higher exploration expenditures ($40 greater than 2004); Increased reclamation and remediation costs ($37 in 2005); Minahasa environmental and Buyat Bay related costs, including settlement of the civil suit ($56); Loss from discontinued operations at Holloway and Golden Grove of $52 in 2005 compared to a gain of $37 in 2004; and Increased minority interests expense at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau ($45 greater than 2004). 38 Table of Contents Liquidity The Company financial position was as follows: At December 31, 2005 2004 Total debt $ 1,929 $ 1,602 Total stockholders equity $ 8,376 $ 7,938 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,082 $ 781 During 2005 our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $583; Net cash provided from continuing operations of $1,253; Proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and other assets of $226; Debt repayments of $218 cash and $48 non-cash; Capital expenditures at continuing operations of $1,226; Dividends paid to common shareholders of $179; and Dividends paid to minority interests of $186. Looking Forward Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to the following: Fluctuations in gold prices and, to a lesser extent, copper prices; Newmont expects 2006 consolidated gold sales of approximately 8 million ounces (approximately 6.25 million equity ounces) at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $280 to $285 per ounce. As a result of lower production from Yanacocha in Peru, planned mine closures in Canada and Nevada and previously announced asset sales, equity gold sales are expected to decline by a further 3% in 2007. Costs applicable to sales are expected to improve as gold sales increase after 2007 with the completion of the Leeville, Phoenix and power plant projects in Nevada, and the Ahafo and Akyem projects in Ghana. Capital expenditures in 2006 are expected to be between $1,350 and $1,500 (including costs related to the Ahafo and Akyem projects in Ghana, the Leeville and Phoenix projects in Nevada, the power plant in Nevada and mine equipment, leach pad expansions and processing facilities at Yanacocha) before the consideration of the acquisition of an additional 22.22% interest in the Boddington project; and We expect 2006 exploration expenditures of between $155 and $160. Accounting Changes Consolidation of Batu Hijau In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FIN 46R, which provides guidance on the identification and reporting for entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46R defines such entities as variable interest entities ( VIEs ). Application of this revised interpretation was required in financial statements for companies that have interests in VIEs or potential VIEs, commonly referred to as special-purpose entities, for periods ending after December 31, 2003. Application for all other types of entities was required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. 39 Table of Contents Newmont identified the Nusa Tenggara Partnership ( NTP ) and P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara ( PTNNT ) (collectively, Batu Hijau ) as VIEs because of certain capital structures and contractual relationships (primarily the sharing of the expected residual returns with a party that did not have an equity investment at risk that is considered significant to the total expected residual returns, as well as indications of insufficient equity). Newmont also determined that it is the primary beneficiary of Batu Hijau. Therefore, as of January 1, 2004, the Company fully consolidated Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For periods prior to 2004, the investment in Batu Hijau was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Upon consolidation of Batu Hijau, effective January 1, 2004, certain adjustments were recorded to the opening balance sheet of PTNNT to conform to Newmont accounting policies. These adjustments were recorded to change from units-of-production depreciation of processing plant and mining facilities to straight-line depreciation of such facilities and to change from allocating costs to stockpile inventories based on mining costs per ton to allocating costs based on recoverable pounds of copper equivalent contained in the various categories of stockpiles. The impact of these adjustments were charges of $15 and $32, respectively, net of income tax expense and minority interest which have been recorded in Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax in the 2004 Statements of Consolidated Income. The consolidation had a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Mineral Interests On April 30, 2004, a FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) was issued amending Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141 and No. 142 to provide that certain mineral rights are considered tangible assets and that mineral rights should be accounted for based on their substance. The FSP was effective for the first reporting period beginning after April 29, 2004, with early adoption permitted. As a result, Newmont reclassified all of its mineral, royalty and oil and gas interests, with a carrying value of $1,273, from mineral interests and other intangible assets to Property, plant and mine development, net in its balance sheets and ceased amortization of exploration stage mineral interests effective April 1, 2004. Reclamation and Remediation (Asset Retirement Obligations) In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which established a uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. The statement was adopted January 1, 2003, when the Company recorded the estimated present value of reclamation liabilities and increased the carrying amount of the related asset, which resulted in a net expense for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $35. Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that the Company believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported . Carrying Value of Goodwill At December 31, 2005, the carrying value of goodwill was approximately $2,879. Goodwill was assigned to the Company Merchant Banking ($1,562) and Exploration ($1,126) Segments and to various mine site reporting units in the Australia/New Zealand Segment ($191). This goodwill arose in connection with our February 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada, and represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Our approach to allocating goodwill was to identify those reporting units that we believed had contributed to such excess purchase price. We then performed 40 Table of Contents valuations to measure the incremental increases in the fair values of such reporting units that were attributable to the acquisitions, and that were not already captured in the fair values assigned to such units identifiable net assets. In the case of the Merchant Banking and Exploration Segments, these valuations were based on each reporting unit potential for future growth, and in the case of the mine site reporting units, the valuation was based on the merger-related synergies that were expected to be realized by each mine site reporting unit. We evaluate, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish this, we compare the estimated fair values of the reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value at the time of the evaluation, we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount and any shortfall would be charged to earnings. Assumptions underlying fair value estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Newmont performed its annual impairment tests of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2005 and determined that goodwill at one reporting unit, Nevada, was impaired as of December 31, 2005, as discussed below. A similar assessment by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2004 determined that the Pajingo reporting unit was impaired as of December 31, 2004. To the extent the assumptions used in the Company valuation models, described below, for such impairment tests are not achieved in the future, it is reasonably possible that the Company will record charges for impairment of goodwill in future periods. The specific application of the Company goodwill impairment policy with respect to the Merchant Banking Segment, Exploration Segment and mine site reporting units is separately discussed below. Merchant Banking Segment Goodwill Newmont Merchant Banking Segment is comprised of an equity portfolio, focused on managing the Company portfolio of equity securities, a royalty portfolio, portfolio management activities, providing in-house investment banking and advisory services to the Company, and downstream business activities. At December 31, 2005, the $1,562 carrying value of the Merchant Banking Segment goodwill represented approximately 58% of the carrying value of the total assets of the Merchant Banking Segment. Based on a December 31, 2005 valuation of the Merchant Banking Segment, the Company concluded that the fair value of the Merchant Banking Segment was significantly in excess of its carrying value at December 31, 2005. The December 31, 2005 discounted cash flow analysis for the Equity Portfolio of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) pre-tax returns on investment ranging from 35% in 2006 and gradually declining to 15% in 2013 through 2015; (iv) an initial equity portfolio investment of approximately $940; (v) capital infusions of $50 annually for the next three years; and (vi) a terminal value of approximately $3,885. The December 31, 2005 discounted cash flow analysis for the Royalty Portfolio of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) an annual growth rate of 5% in the Royalty Portfolio; and (iv) a pre-tax rate of return on investment of 13%. The December 31, 2005 discounted cash flow analysis for the Portfolio Management of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax advisory fee of 5% on approximately $500 of transactions and value-added activities in 2006, with the dollar amount of such transactions and activities increasing by 5% annually thereafter. The December 31, 2005 discounted cash flow analysis for the downstream business of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax annual return on investment of 15%. The December 31, 2005 discounted cash flow analysis assumed a combined terminal value for the royalty portfolio, portfolio management and downstream business of approximately $707. For purposes of valuing the Merchant Banking Segment in the future, the Company expects that the valuation model will continue to be reevaluated and enhanced to recognize the activities and objectives of the Merchant Banking Segment. The key drivers of such future valuations are expected to include (i) expected long-term investment returns, adjusted for Company specific and market driven factors; (ii) expected economic value 41 Table of Contents to be added by the Merchant Banking Segment in addition to such investment returns; (iii) the level of capital accessible by the Merchant Banking Segment; and (iv) other relevant facts and circumstances. To determine the appropriate returns, investment levels and other assumptions for purposes of this analysis, the Company will (i) review the expected or actual returns from transactions that were initiated and/or completed since the last impairment test; (ii) assess the actual economic value added by other Merchant Banking Segment activities since the last impairment test; and (iii) assess the ongoing appropriateness of all assumptions impacting the valuation based on then current conditions and expectations. The Company believes that any model used to value the Merchant Banking Segment will need to take into account the relatively long time horizon required to evaluate the investment returns and other economic value added activities of the Merchant Banking Segment. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining the assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of the Merchant Banking Segment. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from the corresponding assumptions and estimates. If a triggering event were to occur that could reasonably be expected to result in an impairment of the carrying value of the Merchant Banking Segment, the Company would be required to test the goodwill assigned to the Merchant Banking Segment as of the end of the reporting period in which any such event occurred. The Company believes that triggering events with respect to the Merchant Banking Segment could include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company partial or complete withdrawal of financial support for the Merchant Banking Segment; (ii) a significant reduction in management long-term expectation of the price of gold, given the adverse effect such a development could have on the fair values of the Merchant Banking Segment investment and royalty interest portfolios and the Merchant Banking Segment prospects for future growth; (iii) the divestiture of a significant portion of the Merchant Banking Segment investment portfolio together with management determination not to fund the replenishment of such portfolio for the foreseeable future; and (iv) any other event that might adversely affect the ability of the Merchant Banking Segment to consummate transactions that create value for the Company. The Company currently has no plans to withdraw financial support for the Merchant Banking Segment. For a discussion of the results of operations of the Merchant Banking Segment, see Results of Operations, Merchant Banking Segment, below. Exploration Segment Goodwill The Exploration Segment is responsible for all activities, regardless of location, associated with the Company efforts to discover new mineralized material that could ultimately advance into proven and probable reserves. As discussed in greater detail below, when performing its Exploration Segment goodwill impairment testing, the Company only uses historic additions to proven and probable reserves as an indication of the expected future performance of the Exploration Segment. In this regard, once a discovery is made by the Exploration Segment, all subsequent reserve additions (or subtractions) resulting from that original discovery are considered in determining the expected future performance of the Exploration Segment. Internally generated proven and probable reserve additions are attributed to the Exploration Segment for purposes of determining the Company assumptions with respect to the expected future performance of the Exploration Segment only to the extent that such additions are derived from (i) a discovery made by the Company; or (ii) a discovery made on previously acquired properties as a result of exploration efforts conducted subsequent to the acquisition date. A portion of the additions to proven and probable reserves during 2003 through 2005 was derived from the conversion of mineralized material that had been assigned values as part of the purchase price allocation process. In addition, the Company expects that a portion of internally generated reserve additions during 2006 and the next several years will also be derived from the conversion of mineralized material which had been assigned values as part of purchase price accounting. To avoid duplication, the reserves which are expected to be derived from this mineralized material in the future are excluded from the reserve additions used in the valuation of the Exploration Segment performed in connection with the Company goodwill impairment tests. 42 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005, the $1,126 carrying value of the Exploration Segment goodwill represented approximately 99% of the carrying value of the total assets of the Exploration Segment. Based on valuations of the Exploration Segment at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company concluded that substantially all of the fair value of the Exploration Segment, which was significantly in excess of the carrying value, was derived from the terminal value. The valuation models included the following: As at December 31, 2005 2004 Assumptions: Initial year additions to reserves (gold ounces in millions): Total additions 9.5 11.0 Less: Additions previously valued in purchase accounting (0.9 ) (1.0 ) Additions attributable to the Exploration Segment 8.6 10.0 Annual reserve addition growth rate 5 % 5 % Time horizon (years) 16 16 Time lag between reserve additions and production (years) 7.1 7.2 Production period (years) 5 5 Discount rate 8 % 8 % Price/cost assumptions (per ounce of gold): Gold price $ 450 $ 375 Operating costs $ 264 $ 230 Capital costs $ 56 $ 50 Finding costs $ 13 $ 13 Terminal value $ 7,514 $ 5,812 Additions to proven and probable reserves used in the Company valuation models were based on management reviews of historical performance and expectations of future reserve additions. Any model used to value the Exploration Segment will need to take into account the relatively long time horizon required to evaluate the activities of the Exploration Segment. Reserve additions may vary significantly from year to year based on the timing of when proven and probable reserves can be reported under SEC Industry Guide 7. A period of several years may be required to advance a project from initial discovery to proven and probable reserves. The Company December 31, 2005 Exploration Segment goodwill valuation model assumed proven and probable reserve additions attributable to the Exploration segment of 8.6 million equity ounces in 2006. Actual proven and probable additions attributable to the Exploration segment for 2005 and 2004 compared to assumptions used at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were as follows: (millions of equity ounces) Actual Assumption (1) Excess (shortfall) 2005 Total additions 9.4 11.0 (1.6 ) Additions previously valued in purchase accounting (1.2 ) (1.0 ) (0.2 ) Additions attributable to the Exploration Segment 8.2 10.0 (1.8 ) 2004 Total additions 12.4 7.9 4.5 Additions previously valued in purchase accounting (1.9 ) (5.0 ) 3.1 Reclassification of Cerro Quilish reserves (2.0 ) (2.0 ) Additions attributable to the Exploration Segment 8.5 2.9 5.6 (1) Additions assumed in the Exploration Segment valuation models for 2005 at December 31, 2004 and for 2004 at December 31, 2003. 43 Table of Contents Triggering events with respect to the Exploration Segment could include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company partial or complete withdrawal of financial support for the Exploration Segment; (ii) a significantly lower assumed annual reserve addition growth rate; (iii) a significant decrease in the Company long-term expectation of the price of gold; (iv) a significant change in the financial markets resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate; and (v) a significant increase in long-term operating and capital cost estimates. The Company currently has no plans to withdraw financial support for the Exploration Segment. For a discussion of the results of operations of the Exploration Segment, see Results of Operations, Exploration Segment, below. On December 27, 2005 and February 17, 2006, the Company received letters from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Corporate Finance ( Comment Letters ) in regards to the Company Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. The Comment Letters primarily relate to the Company disclosures regarding the Exploration Segment and the valuation model used to estimate the fair value of the Exploration Segment for annual goodwill impairment testing. The Company has made certain additional disclosures in response to the Comment Letters and will continue to respond to any additional issues. The Company continues to believe that the valuation model utilized in assessing the Exploration Segment goodwill is reasonable and consistent with the application of generally accepted accounting principles. Mine Site Goodwill The assignment of goodwill to mine site reporting units was based on synergies that have been incorporated into the Company operations and business plans over time. The amount of goodwill assigned to each segment or reporting unit was based on discounted cash flow analyses that assumed risk-adjusted discount rates over the remaining lives of the applicable mining operations. The Company believes that triggering events with respect to the goodwill assigned to mine site reporting units could include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant decrease in the Company long-term gold price assumption; (ii) a decrease in reserves; (iii) a significant reduction in the estimated fair value of mine site exploration potential; and (iv) any event that might otherwise adversely affect mine site production levels or costs. The Company performed its annual impairment test of mine site goodwill as of December 31, 2005 and determined that, except in the case of its Nevada reporting unit, the fair value of each mine site reporting unit was in excess of the relevant carrying value at December 31, 2005. As a result of increased future operating and capital costs at Nevada the Company determined there was an impairment of $41 as of December 31, 2005. For more information on the discounted cash flows used to value mine site reporting units, see Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets, below. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At the Company surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At the Company underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Depending upon whether the development is expected to benefit the entire remaining ore body, or specific ore blocks or areas only, the UOP basis is either the life of the entire ore body or the life of the specific ore block or area. 44 Table of Contents The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These factors could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual cash costs of mining, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for purpose of depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels and costs of production, capital and reclamation costs, all based on detailed life-of-mine engineering plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future discounted cash flows for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2005, apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $450 per ounce and Australian and Canadian dollar exchange rates of A$1.33 and CDN$1.19, respectively per $1.00. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained from proven and probable reserves and all related exploration stage mineral interests, except for other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential discussed separately below, after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. With the exception of other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential, all assets at a particular operation are considered together for purposes of estimating future cash flows. In the case of mineral interests associated with other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential, cash flows and fair values are individually evaluated based primarily on recent exploration results and recent transactions involving sales of similar properties. As discussed above under Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization, various factors could impact the Company ability to achieve its forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, labor and commodity prices, capital expenditure requirements and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. 45 Table of Contents During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, write-downs of long-lived assets were $43, $39 and $35, respectively. See Consolidated Financial Results below for further discussion. Material changes to any of these factors or assumptions discussed above could result in future impairment charges. Deferred Stripping Costs In general, mining costs are allocated to production costs, stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories, and are charged to Costs applicable to sales when gold or copper is sold. However, at certain open pit mines, which have diverse grades and waste-to-ore ratios over the mine life, the Company defers and amortizes certain mining costs on a units-of-production basis over the life of the mine. These mining costs, which are commonly referred to as deferred stripping costs, are incurred in mining activities that are normally associated with the removal of waste rock. The deferred stripping accounting method is generally accepted in the mining industry where mining operations have diverse grades and waste-to-ore ratios; however, industry practice does vary. Deferred stripping matches the costs of production with the sale of such production at the Company operations where it is employed, by assigning each ounce of gold or pound of copper with an equivalent amount of waste removal cost. If the Company were to expense stripping costs as incurred, there might be greater volatility in the Company period-to-period results of operations. In March 2005, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry, (EITF 04-6) which addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable production costs that should be included as a component of inventory to be recognized in costs applicable to sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. As a result, capitalization of stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period and the carrying value is less than the net realizable value. Newmont will adopt the provisions of EITF 04-6 on January 1, 2006. The most significant impact of adoption is expected to be the removal of deferred and advanced stripping costs from the balance sheet, net of taxes and minority interests, and reclassifying the balances as a cumulative effect adjustment reducing beginning retained earnings by approximately $75 to $85. Adoption of EITF 04-6 will have no impact on the Company cash position. Financial Instruments All financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value, with the exception of contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption. Changes in the fair market value of derivatives recorded on the balance sheet are recorded in the statements of consolidated operations, except for the effective portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. The Company portfolio of derivatives includes various complex instruments that are linked to gold prices and other factors. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding gold and other commodity prices, gold lease rates, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value of derivatives. In addition, certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair market value of these instruments are deferred in Other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated operations when the underlying production designated as the hedged item is sold. All derivative contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are designated against the applicable portion of future production from proven and probable reserves, where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that such future production is no longer probable of occurring due to changes in the factors impacting the determination of reserves, as discussed above under Depreciation, depletion and amortization , gains and losses deferred in Other comprehensive income would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated operations immediately. 46 Table of Contents Reclamation and Remediation Obligations (Asset Retirement Obligations) The Company mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which established a methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. The statement was adopted January 1, 2003, when the Company recorded the estimated present value of reclamation liabilities and increased the carrying amount of the related asset, which resulted in a charge to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of $35. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The reclamation costs will be allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and will be adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate. Such costs related to active mines were accrued and charged over the expected operating lives of the mines using the UOP method based on proven and probable reserves. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate at the end of each period of the undiscounted costs expected to be incurred. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs the Company will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Deferred Tax Assets The Company recognizes the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above under Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could limit the Company ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by its deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. Consolidated Financial Results Sales gold, net increased 3% in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 7% increase in the average realized price, partially offset by a 3% decrease in ounces sold. In 2004, gold sales increased 19% over 2003 primarily due to an increase in the average realized gold price and the consolidation of Batu Hijau. The following analysis reflects the increase in consolidated gold revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Consolidated gold sales, gross $ 3,760 $ 3,636 $ 3,060 Treatment and refining charges (26 ) (11 ) $ (1 ) Consolidated gold sales, net $ 3,734 $ 3,625 $ 3,059 Consolidated gold ounces sold (thousands) 8,552.0 8,828.9 8,377.4 Average realized price per ounce of gold $ 441 $ 412 $ 365 47 Table of Contents The change in consolidated gold sales is due to: 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Changes in consolidated ounces sold $ (123 ) $ (96 ) Consolidation of Batu Hijau 288 Change in average realized gold price 247 380 Change in treatment and refining charges (15 ) (6 ) $ 109 $ 566 Sales copper, net decreased 5% in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 16% decrease in copper pounds sold, partially offset by a 9% increase in the average realized copper price.

The 17% increase in 2004 from 2003 resulted primarily from the consolidation of Batu Hijau and increased costs in Nevada and Australia/New Zealand. Costs applicable to sales copper were $303 and $305 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Newmont has seen significant increases in the costs of fuel, power and other consumables during these periods. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Operations below. 49 Table of Contents The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales by operation: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Gold Nevada, USA $ 807 $ 716 $ 598 Yanacocha, Peru 487 432 362 Australia/New Zealand: Tanami, Australia 162 194 149 Kalgoorlie, Australia 144 141 108 Jundee, Australia 115 106 159 Pajingo, Australia 58 59 43 Martha, New Zealand 29 28 25 508 528 484 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 109 91 Other Operations: Golden Giant, Canada 48 48 53 Zarafshan, Uzbekistan 27 32 33 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 16 10 36 La Herradura, Mexico 15 10 11 Ovacik, Turkey 23 22 Minahasa, Indonesia 20 26 Mesquite, USA 9 106 143 190 $ 2,017 $ 1,910 $ 1,634 Copper Batu Hijau, Indonesia $ 303 $ 305 $ Deferred stripping. In general, mining costs are allocated to production costs, stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories, and are charged to Costs applicable to sales when gold or copper is sold. However, at certain open pit mines that have diverse grades and waste-to-ore ratios over the mine life, the Company defers and amortizes certain mining costs on a units-of-production basis over the life of the mine. These mining costs, which are commonly referred to as deferred stripping costs, are incurred in mining activities that are normally associated with the removal of waste rock. The deferred stripping accounting method is generally accepted in the mining industry where mining operations have diverse grade and waste-to-ore rations; however, industry practice does vary. Deferred stripping matches the costs of production with the sale of such production at the Company operations where it is employed, by assigning each ounce of gold with an equivalent amount of waste removal cost. If the Company were to expense stripping costs as incurred, there might be greater volatility in the Company period-to-period results of operations. Details of deferred stripping with respect to certain of the Company open pit mines are as follows: Nevada (4) La Herradura (5) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Life-of-mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 126.6 126.5 125.0 146.9 149.1 146.4 Average ore grade (2) 0.046 0.051 0.049 0.034 0.034 0.030 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (1) 139.1 154.3 124.9 193.0 156.1 157.4 Average ore grade (2) 0.053 0.059 0.075 0.029 0.026 0.026 Remaining Mine Life (years) (3) 16 10 9 4 4 5 50 Table of Contents Tanami (6) Kalgoorlie (7) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Life-of-mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) N/A 82.3 48.8 100.1 110.9 114.8 Average ore grade (2) N/A 0.160 0.160 0.061 0.061 0.065 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (1) N/A 52.3 63.5 116.3 102.9 112.2 Average ore grade (2) N/A 0.130 0.108 0.062 0.063 0.063 Remaining Mine Life (years) (3) N/A 1 1 12 13 13 Martha (8) Ovacik (9) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Life-of-mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 18.8 26.1 32.1 N/A 41.6 34.9 Average ore grade (2) 0.114 0.107 0.103 N/A 0.385 0.356 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (1) 12.9 31.7 29.5 N/A 57.0 40.4 Average ore grade (2) 0.143 0.091 0.089 N/A 0.298 0.374 Remaining Mine Life (years) (3) 1 3 3 N/A 2 2 Batu Hijau (10) 2005 2004 2003 Life-of-mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 0.20 0.22 N/A Average ore grade (2) 4.93 4.63 N/A Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (1) 0.21 0.16 N/A Average ore grade (2) 4.74 6.22 N/A Remaining Mine Life (years) (3) 13 14 N/A (1) Total tons to be mined in future divided by total ounces of gold or total pounds of copper equivalent to be recovered in future, based on proven and probable reserves.

(2) Total tons mined divided by total ounces of gold recovered or total pounds of copper equivalent recovered. (3) Remaining mine life (years) is as of January 1 st of the year being presented and is based on the then current life-of-mine plan. (4) The actual stripping ratio and average ore grade are higher than the life-of-mine. The stripping ratio will increase when operations commence at Phoenix. (5) The actual stripping ratio is higher in 2005 primarily due to increased waste tons being mined. La Herradura is included in the Company Other North America reportable segment. (6) Open pit operations at Tanami were completed in 2004. Tanami is included in the Company Australia/New Zealand reportable segment. (7) The actual stripping ratio is higher in 2005 primarily due to increased waste tons being mined. Kalgoorlie is included in the Company Australia/New Zealand reportable segment. (8) The actual stripping ratio is lower in 2005 primarily due to the higher average ore grade. Martha is included in the Company Australia/New Zealand reportable segment. (9) Ovacik suspended mine operations in August 2004 and was sold in March 2005. Ovacik was included in the Company Central Asia reportable segment. (10) The actual stripping ratio in 2005 is significantly higher than the prior year, primarily a result of the lower average ore grade. The average ore grade in 2005 was impacted as several small pit wall failures limited access to high-grade ore in the bottom of the pit. 51 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased 3% in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to the disposition of the Ovacik mine in Turkey and lower consolidated ounces sold. The 25% increase in 2004 from 2003 primarily resulted from the consolidation of Batu Hijau and significant capital expenditures in recent years at Yanacocha. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease. For a complete discussion, see Results of Operations, below. Newmont expects Depreciation, depletion and amortization to increase to approximately $740 to $780 in 2006. The following is a summary of Depreciation, depletion and amortization by operation: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Nevada, USA $ 124 $ 127 $ 138 Yanacocha, Peru 205 198 160 Australia/New Zealand: Tanami, Australia 33 38 36 Kalgoorlie, Australia 17 16 10 Jundee, Australia 27 27 36 Pajingo, Australia 25 31 29 Martha, New Zealand 16 14 11 Gold 118 126 122 Other 3 4 5 121 130 127 Batu Hijau, Indonesia Gold 34 28 Copper 87 90 121 118 Other Operations: Golden Giant, Canada 11 11 22 Zarafshan, Uzbekistan 9 10 10 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 4 2 7 La Herradura, Mexico 5 5 3 Ovacik, Turkey 16 14 Minahasa, Indonesia 3 8 Mesquite, USA 4 Gold 29 47 68 Other 3 4 3 32 51 71 Other: Merchant Banking 21 24 26 Corporate and Other 20 14 8 41 38 34 $ 644 $ 662 $ 530 Exploration was $147, $107 and $76 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The period-to-period increases reflect increased exploration and related activity in response to higher prevailing gold prices. Advanced projects, research and development were $73, $80 and $35 during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing spending on advanced projects, feasibility studies and exploration drilling at Martabe, Akyem, Ahafo and Conga. Newmont expects Exploration to be approximately $155 to $160 and Advanced projects, research and development to be approximately $40 to $45 in 2006. 52 Table of Contents General and administrative was $134, $116 and $130 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 from 2004 was attributable to increased salaries, benefits, consulting and contracted services. The decrease in 2004 from 2003 resulted from an increase in the allocation of costs incurred by corporate to the individual operations in 2004, partially offset by an increase in consulting fees and costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.0% in 2005, compared to 2.6% in 2004 and 4.2% in 2003. Newmont expects General and administrative expenses to be approximately $150 to $160 in 2006, including $9 in stock option expense under FAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006. Write-down of goodwill was $41 and $52 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 expense was related to the Nevada segment resulting from anticipated increased future operating and capital costs. The 2004 expense was related to the Pajingo reporting unit in Australia resulting from anticipated increased future operating costs and lower grade ore. Write-down of long-lived assets totaled $43, $39 and $35 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 write-down primarily related to an advanced exploration project in Indonesia and exploration tenements in Australia. The 2004 write-down included $16 related to the Ovacik mine in Turkey. The remainder of the write-down for 2004 was related to exploration tenements in Australia, long-lived asset impairment resulting from a reevaluation of future production and operating costs at Pajingo, and processing facilities at Yanacocha. The 2003 write-down included a $28 impairment charge at Golden Giant. For a discussion of the Company policy for assessing the carrying value of its goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, see Critical Accounting Policies, above. Other expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $111, $33 and $50, respectively. Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Reclamation and remediation $ 37 $ (11 ) $ 33 Minahasa environmental and goodwill agreement (Note 32) 56 7 Nevada waste dump slide 6 Other 12 37 17 $ 111 $ 33 $ 50 The 2005 expense included legal and other costs incurred in regards to pollution allegations at Minahasa in Indonesia, changes in environmental obligation estimates at other non-operating properties, costs incurred to stabilize material and repair damage to roads and utility lines for a waste dump slide in Nevada and a pension settlement loss. The 2004 expense related to the closure of Minahasa, care and maintenance charges at Ovacik, engineering and permitting expenses for the power plant in Nevada and other miscellaneous expenses. The 2003 expense included additions to reclamation and remediation liabilities related to depleted ore bodies, an accrual for certain environmental obligations, costs associated with the finalization of a de-watering agreement in Nevada, severance costs at the Kori Kollo project in Bolivia, and costs related to compliance and governance implementation activities. 53 Table of Contents Other income, net in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $269, $102 and $451, respectively, and is summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Royalty and dividend income, net $ 79 $ 64 $ 56 Interest income 59 23 11 Gain on sale of other assets, net 48 28 15 Gain (loss) on investments, net 54 (39 ) 83 Gain on derivative investments, net 2 2 23 Foreign currency exchange gains 8 7 97 Gain (loss) on QMC debt guarantee 9 11 (30 ) Gain on extinguishment of NYOL liabilities, net 221 Loss on extinguishment of debt (34 ) Other 10 6 9 $ 269 $ 102 $ 451 Royalty and dividend income increased each year due to higher gold, oil and gas prices and as a result of distributions received from Canadian Oil Sands Trust, which was acquired during the second and third quarters of 2004. Interest income increased each year due to increased funds invested and higher investment yields. The gain on sale of other assets during 2005 was primarily attributable to the sale of the Mezcala gold deposit for a gain of $31. The 2004 gain on sale of other assets primarily resulted from the sale of Perama, Midwest Uranium and Bronzewing. The 2003 gain resulted from the sale of Mesquite and Wiluna. The gain on investments during 2005 was primarily attributable to the sale of investments in Kinross and Oxiana which resulted in gains of $20 and $25, respectively. The loss on investments during 2004 was attributable to a $39 impairment of investment in Kinross based on the continued decline in value of Kinross equity securities. The 2003 gain was primarily related to the exchange of Echo Bay equity securities for Kinross equity securities. The gain on derivative instruments, net, representing non-cash, mark-to-market gains and losses recognized on ineffective and partially ineffective derivative instruments was $2, $2 and $23 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2003 gain primarily related to the acquired Normandy gold hedge books and resulted predominantly from a strengthening of the Australian dollar, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. dollar gold price. The Company substantially eliminated the acquired Normandy hedge books as of December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the Company converted CDN$499 of intercompany loans with a subsidiary whose functional currency is the Canadian dollar, to long-term notes, as the Company does not intend to settle these loans in the foreseeable future. As a result, the Company no longer records foreign currency gains and losses in earnings with respect to the converted long-term notes. The year ended December 31, 2003 foreign currency exchange gain included: (i) exchange gains, net of $59 on the Canadian dollar-denominated intercompany loans reflecting a strengthening of the Canadian dollar during the period; (ii) a $27 mark-to-market gain on ineffective foreign currency swaps; (iii) a $19 foreign currency gain on the translation of Newmont Australia Limited financial statements to U.S. dollars; and (iv) other foreign currency losses of $8. Newmont was the guarantor of an A$71 (approximately $53) amortizing loan facility of QMC Finance Pty Ltd. ( QMC ) which was collateralized by the assets of the Queensland Magnesium Project. Newmont reduced the amount accrued for this contingent obligation by the estimated fair value of the Australian Magnesium 54 Table of Contents Corporation assets that would be subrogated to Newmont in the event the guarantee was called, which resulted in a $30 loss during 2003. During 2004, Newmont entered into a transaction resulting in a loan from Newmont to a subsidiary of QMC for A$30 (approximately $23), the release of Newmont from its guarantee obligation and recognition of an $11 gain resulting from the release of all previously accrued contingent liabilities. An allowance was provided for 100% of the loan receivable from the QMC entity. In 2005, a gain was recognized for A$12 (approximately $9), resulting from a reduction in the allowance provided on the loan receivable. Gain on extinguishment of NYOL liabilities, net was $221 in 2003. In 2003, Newmont acquired all of Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd ( NYOL ) outstanding 8 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2008 and all of NYOL gold hedge contracts from the relevant counterparties. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $34 in 2003. During 2003, Newmont repurchased $148 of its 8 3 / 8 % debentures, $52 of its 8 5 / 8 % debentures, $81 of Newmont Australia 7 1 / 2 % guaranteed notes, $31 of Newmont Australia 7 5 / 8 % guaranteed notes and 100% of its 6% convertible subordinated debentures for total cash consideration of $446. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, Financing Activities . Interest expense, net of capitalized interest was $98, $98 and $89 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $39, $13 and $9 in each year, respectively. Interest costs increased in 2005 from 2004 due to the issuance of the $600 5 7 / 8 % notes in March 2005. Capitalized interest increased in 2005 due to construction of Leeville and Phoenix in Nevada and Ahafo in Ghana. Interest increased during 2004 as compared to 2003 as a result of the consolidation of Batu Hijau. Newmont expects Interest expense, net of capitalized interest to be approximately $95 to $105 in 2006. Income tax expense was $314 in 2005, compared to $325 and $212 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective tax rates were 29.5%, 29.2%, and 22.8% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, based on pre-tax income of $1,064 in 2005, $1,111 in 2004 and $931 in 2003. The factors that most significantly impact the Company effective tax rate are percentage depletion and resource allowances, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to minority interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, foreign currency translation gains and losses, changes in tax laws and the impact of certain specific transactions. Most of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed the Company tax basis in its mineral reserves) are available to the Company under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in the Company consolidated United States income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company. For 2005 and prior years, similar types of deductions are available for mining operations in Canada and are referred to as resource allowances. The tax benefits from percentage depletion and resource allowances were $47, $47 and $21 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2004 and 2005 compared to 2003 primarily is due to an increase in the Company average realized gold price. The Company operates in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. Many of these differences combine to move the Company overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the United States statutory rate depending on the mix of income relative to income earned in the United States. The effect of these differences is shown in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as either a foreign rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings, net of credits. Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations make the Company ability to fully utilize all of its available foreign income tax credits on a year-by-year basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower prices or higher costs can result in the Company having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carryback and carryforward periods and can only be used to reduce the United States income tax imposed on the Company foreign earnings included in its annual United States consolidated income tax return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable credits, were an increase of 55 Table of Contents income tax expense of $10 and $11 in 2005 and 2004 respectively, and a reduction of income tax expense of $28 in 2003. The Company separately stated, in its effective income tax rate reconciliation under Change in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets , income tax expense of $30 in 2005, resulting from the establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been released in prior periods. This establishment of valuation allowance primarily was caused by the realization of higher sources of taxable income, and therefore higher taxes, outside the United States and lower taxable income inside the United States resulting from an increase in operating costs. The effect of different income tax rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested contributed to an increase in the Company income tax expense of $8 and $61 in 2005 and 2004 respectively, and a decrease in income tax expense of $11 in 2003. The tax effect of changes in local country tax laws, as shown in the Company effective tax reconciliation in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted in a net tax benefit of $24, $51 and $36 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The net tax benefit is primarily related to a change in tax law in Australia that allows the Company to consolidate wholly-owned subsidiaries in that country. The need to record valuation allowances related to the Company deferred tax assets (primarily attributable to net operating losses and tax credits) is principally dependent on the following factors: (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit; (ii) the Company long-term estimate of future average realized minerals prices; and (iii) the degree to which many of the tax laws and income tax agreements imposed upon the Company and its subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax deductions early in the mining process. These up-front deductions can give rise to net operating losses and credit carryforwards in circumstances where future sources of taxable income may not coincide with available carryforward periods even after taking into account all available tax planning strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities, accrued for financial reporting purposes, may not be deductible for tax purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could happen after mining operations have ceased, when sufficient sources of taxable income may not be available. Changes to valuation allowances increased income tax expense by $22 in 2005, and decreased income tax expense $59 and $85 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. As noted above, $30 of the valuation allowance addition in 2005 was a result of re-establishing a valuation allowance that was released in prior periods with respect to the Company foreign tax credits. The Company, for financial reporting purposes, consolidates subsidiaries of which it does not own 100% of the outstanding equity. However, for tax purposes, the Company only is responsible for the income taxes on the portion of the taxable earnings attributable to its ownership interest of each consolidated entity. Such minority interests contributed $15, $7 and $22 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, as reductions in the Company income tax expense. The Company effective tax decreased by $14 and $13 in 2005 and 2004 respectively due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared with an increase of $54 in 2003. In 2005 and 2004, these amounts primarily relate to the Australian tax effect of realized and unrealized translation gains attributable to United States dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and the gold derivatives positions at Newmont Australia Limited whose functional currency is the United States dollar. Because Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from Newmont Australia Limited, no offsetting United States deferred income tax effect can be recorded. The effect in 2005 and 2004 differed from 2003 because of the significant strengthening of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar that took place primarily in 2003 versus relative weakness of the Australian dollar in 2004 and 2005. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing the Company effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 34% in 2006. Minority interest in income of subsidiaries was $380, $335 and $173 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 increase from 2004 resulted from increased earnings at Yanacocha due to increased gold price and 56 Table of Contents ounces sold, partially offset by an increase in costs (see Results of Operations, South American Operations). The 2004 increase from 2003 resulted from the recording of the minority interest in Batu Hijau which was consolidated in 2004 (see Accounting Changes, above), and increased earnings at Yanacocha. Equity income (loss) of affiliates was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 European Gold Refineries $ 6 $ 1 $ AGR Matthey Joint Venture (2 ) 1 1 Batu Hijau (1) 83 Australian Magnesium Corporation (2) (119 ) $ 4 $ 2 $ (35 ) (1) Batu Hijau was consolidated effective January 1, 2004. See Accounting Changes, above, for more information. (2) In December 2003, the Company sold its interest in Australian Magnesium Corporation. The Loss from discontinued operations in 2005 resulted from the classification of the Golden Grove copper-zinc operation in Australia and the Holloway gold operation in Canada as discontinued operations. The Company recorded $42 in pre-tax write-downs of long-lived assets and reclassified the income statement results from the historical presentation to discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. The gain of $37 in 2004 was primarily due to a tax credit from an election to prepare a consolidated tax return in Australia (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax was $47 and $35 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. The 2004 charge resulted from the consolidation of Batu Hijau to conform Batu Hijau accounting policies to Newmont accounting policies. The 2003 charge reflects the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, that changed the method of accounting for the Company estimated mine reclamation and abandonment costs. See Accounting Changes, above, for more information. Other comprehensive income, net of tax in 2005 included a $282 gain in value of marketable equity securities and a $57 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, offset by losses of $59 related to a minimum pension liability adjustment and $26 for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Other comprehensive income, net of tax in 2004 included a $123 gain in value of marketable equity securities and a $31 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, offset by losses of $11 related to a minimum pension liability adjustment and $19 for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Other comprehensive income, net of tax in 2003, included a $68 gain on the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges and a $23 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, partially offset by a loss of $5 related to a decline in value of marketable equity securities. 57 Table of Contents Results of Consolidated Operations Gold Ounces or Copper Pounds Sold Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 (ounces in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada 2,444.1 2,538.0 2,490.8 $ 333 $ 282 $ 240 $ 51 $ 50 $ 55 Yanacocha (2) (51.35% owned) 3,327.5 3,039.9 2,858.7 147 142 127 62 65 56 Australia/New Zealand 1,600.5 1,887.6 2,016.7 317 280 239 74 67 61 Batu Hijau (2)(3)(4) 720.5 715.2 152 128 47 39 Other (2) 459.4 648.2 1,011.2 229 220 189 63 73 67 Total/Weighted-Average 8,552.0 8,828.9 8,377.4 $ 236 $ 216 $ 195 $ 60 $ 60 $ 58 (pounds in millions) ($ per pound) ($ per pound) Copper Batu Hijau (2)(3)(4) 572.7 683.3 N/A $ 0.53 $ 0.45 $ N/A $ 0.15 $ 0.13 $ N/A (1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization. (2) Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes minority interests share. (3) Economic interest decreased to 52.875% from 56.25% on October 1, 2004. (4) Batu Hijau was consolidated as of January 1, 2004. Batu Hijau was accounted for using the equity method in 2003, and as a result was not included in Costs applicable to sales or Depreciation, depletion and amortization per ounce or pound in 2003. Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased 3% in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to: lower grade ores processed in Nevada and Australia/New Zealand; the dispositions of Ovacik (Other) and Bronzewing (Australia/New Zealand); and the completion of operations at Minahasa (Other); partially offset by increased sales at Yanacocha. Consolidated gold ounces sold increased 5% in 2004 from 2003 primarily due to: the consolidation of Batu Hijau as of January 1, 2004; partially offset by reduced throughput at Golden Giant (Other); the completion of milling at Kori Kollo (Other); and the suspension of operations at Ovacik (Other). Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased 16% in 2005 from 2004 due to the processing of lower grade copper ore at Batu Hijau. Access to ore in the lower portion of the pit was temporarily restricted as a result of several small pit wall slides during the first quarter of 2005. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 10% in 2005 from 2004 and 11% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to the decrease in production and increased operating costs in Nevada and Australia/New Zealand. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound increased 18% in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to the decrease in copper production. The Company expects consolidated gold sales of approximately 8.0 million ounces in 2006 at Costs applicable to sales of between $280 to $285 per ounce. 58 Table of Contents Nevada Operations Nevada gold ounces sold decreased 4% in 2005 from 2004, as a 12% decrease in mill ore grade and sales from inventories in 2004 were partially offset by an 18% increase in mill throughput and a 12% increase in heap leach ore placed. Adverse mill grades were caused by unfavorable ground conditions at underground operations and a labor shortage impacting underground development. Ore placed on the leach pads increased by 12% in 2005 from 2004 due to increased open pit production from Carlin and Twin Creeks. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 18%, primarily due to increased labor, diesel and other commodity prices, a decrease in ounces produced and higher underground contract service costs. Experienced miners, particularly underground miners, are in short supply in Nevada and labor rates have increased in line with this shortfall. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Nevada recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $41 as a result of anticipated increased future operating and capital costs. Gold ounces sold increased 2% in 2004 from 2003 as a 13% increase in mill throughput and sales from inventories offset a 13% decrease in mill ore grade and 15% lower heap leach production. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 18%, primarily due to the processing of lower-grade material, higher contract service costs for ore haulage and higher diesel, electricity and mine equipment maintenance costs. Consolidated gold sales for 2006 are expected to be approximately 2.6 million ounces at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $380 per ounce. The Company has completed the permitting process and received approval from its Board of Directors for construction and operation of a 200-megawatt coal-fired power plant. Construction has commenced and capital costs are expected to be approximately $450. Project completion is targeted for the first half of 2008. Non-governmental organizations have brought a series of actions relating to the Nevada operations, as described in more detail in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While Newmont believes that the legal actions are without merit, unfavorable outcomes could result in additional conditions being imposed on the Company operations, and such conditions could have a material adverse effect on Nevada results of operations or financial position. Yanacocha Operations Yanacocha gold ounces sold increased 9% in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 12% increase in the grade of ore placed and a 10% increase in the total ore placed, partially offset by timing of flows from the leach pads and increased inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 4% due to increased workers participation payments, increased consumption of reagents and higher royalties due to increased gold prices. Increased labor and commodity costs were partially offset by increased production, related allocation of costs to inventory and increased silver by-product credits. Gold ounces sold increased 6% in 2004 over 2003, primarily due to increased leach solution processing capacity including greater pumping capacity and additional carbon columns. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 12%, primarily due to an increase in workers participation payments resulting from higher taxable income, higher diesel fuel consumption and price, increased consumption of reagents and higher royalties due to increased gold prices. The increases were partially offset by increased silver by-product credits. Consolidated gold sales for 2006 are expected to be approximately 2.6 million ounces at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $185 per ounce. Consolidated gold sales for 2007 through 2010 are expected to average approximately 1.75 million ounces at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $255 per ounce, with actual gold sales and costs being determined by, among other factors, further mine plan optimization efforts, the discovery and development of additional oxide deposits, and the development of Conga, currently assumed to commence production in 2010. 59 Table of Contents During 2004, Peru enacted legislation to establish a sliding scale mining royalty of up to 3% based on the volume of mine production. The royalty is calculated on revenue from sales of product less certain refining and transportation expenses. While the Peruvian royalty became effective during the second quarter of 2004, it does not apply to those projects that had tax stabilization agreements prior to the adoption of the royalty law. Virtually all of Yanacocha current production is derived from projects that were stabilized prior to the enactment of the royalty legislation. However, pending amendment or successful legal challenges to the validity of the royalty legislation, future projects not covered by the tax stabilization agreements could be burdened by this royalty. Cerro Quilish is a deposit within the Yanacocha complex. In July 2004, Yanacocha received a drilling permit for the Cerro Quilish deposit and commenced drilling activities to further define the deposit. During September 2004, individuals from the Cajamarca region, where Cerro Quilish is located, conducted a sustained blockade of the road between the City of Cajamarca and the mine site, in protest of these exploration activities. Yanacocha suspended all drilling activities at Cerro Quilish and the blockade was resolved. At the request of Yanacocha, the Cerro Quilish drilling permit was revoked in November 2004. Yanacocha has reassessed the challenges involved in obtaining required permits for Cerro Quilish primarily related to increased community concerns. Based upon this reassessment, Yanacocha reclassified 3.9 million ounces (2.0 million equity ounces) of gold from proven and probable reserves to mineralized material not in reserve as of December 31, 2004.

(2) Ownership increased from 85.9% to 100% in April 2003. (3) During 2004 and 2003, Jundee included Bronzewing which ceased mining in the first quarter of 2004 and was sold during the third quarter of 2004. Jundee also included Wiluna until its sale in December 2003. (4) Ownership increased from 92.28% to 100% in April 2003. Australia/New Zealand operations sold 15% fewer ounces of gold in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to lower grades at Tanami and Kalgoorlie combined with lower throughput at Tanami and Pajingo. In 2004, gold ounces sold decreased 5% compared to 2003, primarily because of lower production from Pajingo and Jundee due to the sale of Wiluna in December 2003 and Bronzewing in the third quarter of 2004. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2005 from 2004 and in 2004 from 2003 by 13% and 17%, respectively, primarily due to the decrease in ounces sold, increased commodity costs and appreciation of the Australian and New Zealand dollars compared to the U.S. dollar. The unfavorable foreign exchange movements increased Australia/New Zealand Costs applicable to sales in 2005 from 2004 by $15 per ounce and in 2004 from 2003 by $30 per ounce. Tanami, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased 25% in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 16% decline in ore grade from mining lower grade zones of the Callie underground deposit and processing lower grade stockpiles at Groundrush. Mining was completed at Groundrush in 2004 and the lower grade stockpiles were exhausted in the third quarter of 2005. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 12%, primarily due to lower gold production, higher maintenance, diesel, power, ground support and surface works costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar. 60 Table of Contents Gold ounces sold increased 9% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a decrease in inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 20%, primarily due to appreciation of the Australian dollar, higher royalties due to increased gold prices and additional underground backfill costs. Consolidated gold sales for 2006 are expected to be approximately 435,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of $330 per ounce. Kalgoorlie, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased 13% in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 7% decrease in ore grade milled and sales from inventories in 2004, partially offset by a 2% increase in tons milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 17%, primarily due to increased mill throughput, increased diesel, reagent and power costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar. Gold ounces sold increased 16% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a decrease in inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 12%, primarily due to appreciation of the Australian dollar, higher amortization of deferred stripping costs, increased diesel prices and higher processing consumables costs. Consolidated gold sales for 2006 are expected to be approximately 430,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of $395 per ounce. Jundee, Australia . In 2003, the Yandal operations included the Wiluna, Bronzewing and Jundee operations. Operations at Bronzewing ceased during the second quarter of 2004 and Bronzewing was sold the third quarter of 2004 (see Other Investing Activities, below). The Wiluna operation was sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Jundee mine is the remaining Yandal operation. Gold ounces sold decreased 10% in 2005 from 2004, due to the cessation of production at Bronzewing, partially offset by higher mill ore grade from Jundee. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 21%, primarily due to higher underground contract services, steel, diesel and administration costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar. Gold ounces sold decreased 33% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a 46% decrease in mill throughput after the sale of the Wiluna operation and the cessation of production at Bronzewing, partially offset by an 8% increase in mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce remained the same as appreciation of the Australian dollar was offset by production coming mainly from the lower cost Jundee operation. Consolidated gold sales for 2006 are expected to be approximately 335,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of $335 per ounce. Gold ounces sold for 2007 through 2010 are expected to average approximately 296,000 ounces per year. Pajingo, Australia . Gold ounces sold decreased 24% in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 19% decrease in ore milled as low grade stockpiles which supplemented production in 2004 have been exhausted. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 28% due to lower production and appreciation of the Australian dollar. Gold ounces sold decreased 24% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a 33% decline in ore grade and a ground disturbance that delayed mill feed. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 82%, primarily due to the lower ore grade resulting in lower production, increased mine maintenance costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar. During the fourth quarter of 2004, Pajingo recorded goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charges of $52 and $6, respectively, as a result of anticipated increased future operating costs and lower grade ore. Consolidated gold sales for 2006 are expected to be approximately 195,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of $280 per ounce. Based on current mine plans, sales are expected to decline to approximately 135,000 ounces in 2007 and 60,000 ounces in 2008 as Pajingo approaches the end of its current mine life. Martha, New Zealand . Gold ounces sold increased 25% in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 37% increase in ore grade due to mine sequencing, partially offset by a 9% decrease in ore milled. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 18%, primarily due to increased production, partially offset by higher processing costs from harder ore and appreciation of the New Zealand dollar. 61 Table of Contents Gold ounces sold increased 18% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a 16% increase in mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 5%, primarily due to the increase in production, partially offset by appreciation of the New Zealand dollar. Consolidated gold sales are expected to be approximately 130,000 ounces in 2006 at Costs applicable to sales of $235 per ounce. Batu Hijau Operations Gold Ounces or Copper Pounds Sold Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 (ounces in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Gold Batu Hijau (2)(3)(4) 720.5 715.2 N/A $ 152 $ 128 N/A $ 47 $ 39 N/A (pounds in millions) ($ per pound) ($ per pound) Copper Batu Hijau (2)(3)(4) 572.7 683.3 N/A $ 0.53 $ 0.45 N/A $ 0.15 $ 0.13 N/A (1) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization. (2) Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes minority interests share. (3) Economic interest decreased to 52.875% from 56.25% on October 1, 2004. (4) Batu Hijau was consolidated as of January 1, 2004. Batu Hijau was accounted for using the equity method in 2003 and, as a result, was not included in Costs applicable to sales or Depreciation, depletion and amortization per ounce or pound in 2003. During 2003, Newmont accounted for its 56.25% economic interest (a 45% ownership interest) in Batu Hijau under the equity method of accounting. Upon adoption of FIN 46R, Newmont consolidated the operations of Batu Hijau as of January 1, 2004 (see Overview, above). As of October 1, 2004, Batu Hijau cumulative losses had been recovered and Batu Hijau began to report positive retained earnings, allowing for the payment of dividends, 6% of which are paid to the minority partner. Accordingly, Newmont began recognizing the minority interests in Batu Hijau at 47.125% (effective 52.875% Newmont share) of Batu Hijau earnings and will continue to do so until a loan to the minority interest partner is fully repaid (including accrued interest). See Consolidated Financial Results above for more information. Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 15%, by the end of 2005; 23%, by the end of 2006; 30%, by the end of 2007; 37%, by the end of 2008; 44%, by the end of 2009; and 51%, by the end of 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares of the project company would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest in the project company as a going concern. An Indonesian national currently owns a 20% interest in Batu Hijau, which requires the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership to offer a 3% interest in 2006. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in Batu Hijau could be reduced to 49% by the end of 2010. Copper sales decreased 16% and gold sales increased 1% in 2005 from 2004. Access to ore in the lower portion of the pit was temporarily restricted as a result of several small pit wall slides during the first quarter of 2005. As a result, the mine plan was revised, resulting in the processing of lower grade stockpiles. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper increased 18% and per ounce of gold increased 19% primarily as a result of the decrease in copper production, increased fuel, maintenance, consumables, and labor costs. 62 Table of Contents Copper and gold sales quantities increased 12% and 22% in 2004 from 2003, respectively. The increases were primarily attributable to higher mill throughput reflecting modifications to the crusher circuit in the second half of 2003 and higher ore grades (copper 5%, gold 10%). Consolidated sales for 2006 are expected to total approximately 565 million pounds of copper at Costs applicable to sales of $0.45 per pound and 575,000 ounces of gold at Costs applicable to sales of $155 per ounce. Copper and gold sales volumes are lower in 2006 as operations move to lower grade areas in the next mining phase and stripping increases.

(4) Ovacik sold in March 2005 and Mesquite sold in November 2003. Golden Giant, Canada . Gold ounces sold remained constant in 2005 compared to 2004. A 12% increase in mill throughput was offset by a 3% decline in ore grade and increased in-process inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce remained constant as an increase in milling costs due to increased throughput and appreciation of the Canadian dollar was offset by increased in-process inventory at the end of 2005. The unfavorable change in the foreign exchange rate increased Costs applicable to sales by $19 per ounce. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005, with final mill production and gold sales expected in the first quarter of 2006. Gold ounces sold decreased 30% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to reduced mining faces at this mature mine. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 29% in 2004 from 2003, primarily from lower production and appreciation of the Canadian dollar. The unfavorable change in the foreign exchange rate increased Costs applicable to sales by $19 per consolidated ounce. Zarafshan, Uzbekistan . Gold ounces sold decreased 42% in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to 3% fewer tons placed on the leach pads due to unscheduled plant maintenance, and lower gold recoveries associated with a 17% decrease in ore grade and slower flows from the leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 42%, primarily as a result of the decrease in production. Gold ounces sold decreased 4% in 2004 from 2003 as a result of a 3% decrease in ore grade and a 2% decrease in ore placed on the leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 2% primarily a result of the decrease in gold ounces sold. Consolidated gold sales for 2006 are expected to be approximately 130,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of $260 per ounce. 63 Table of Contents Kori Kollo, Bolivia . The mill was shut down in October 2003, however production continued from residual leaching. Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, additional material from the Kori Kollo pit was placed on the existing leach pad and ore from the Kori Chaca pit was processed on a new leach pad. This resulted in ounces sold nearly quadrupling in 2005 from 2004. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 58% from 2004 to 2005 as a result of the increased production. Consolidated gold sales for 2006 are expected to be approximately 125,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of $220 per ounce. La Herradura, Mexico . Gold ounces sold increased 17% in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to a 12% increase in the ore grade and the timing of flows from the leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased by 25% primarily due to increased labor, diesel and other commodity prices. Gold ounces sold increased 1% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due a 3% increase in ore placed on the leach pads. Consolidated gold sales for 2006 are expected to be approximately 85,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of $210 per ounce. Ovacik, Turkey . On March 1, 2005, the Ovacik mine was sold to a subsidiary of Koza Davetiye, a Turkish conglomerate. Operations were suspended in August 2004 as a result of a court decision ordering suspension of operating permits pending completion of certain additional permitting requirements and the submission of an updated environmental impact assessment. Gold ounces sold decreased 35% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to the suspension of operations, partially offset by reducing ore stockpiles and exhausting in-circuit inventory. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 56%, primarily due to the decline in production. In the second quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a write-down of $16 related to the long-lived assets at the Ovacik mine. Minahasa, Indonesia . Mining activities at Minahasa ceased in 2001. Milling of the remaining stockpiles was completed in August 2004. Gold ounces sold decreased 24% in 2004 from 2003, primarily reflecting lower grade ore processed and the completion of milling. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal actions related to Minahasa. Merchant Banking Merchant Banking is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Merchant Banking, also referred to as Newmont Capital, manages a royalty portfolio, an equity portfolio, a downstream gold refining business, and engages in value realization activities (managing interests in oil and gas, iron ore, and coal properties as well as providing in-house investment banking and advisory services). Merchant Banking manages a royalty portfolio which includes interests that were acquired as a result of the Franco-Nevada acquisition, as well as royalties created by virtue of its land bank activities (through sale or farm-out). Royalty interests are generally in the form of a net smelter return ( NSR ) royalty that provides for the payment of a specified percentage of production, less certain specified transportation and refining costs. In some cases, royalties are a net profit interest ( NPI ) entitling Newmont to a specified percentage of the net profits, as defined in each case. The majority of NSR royalty revenue and NPI revenue can be received in cash or in-kind at the option of Newmont. As of December 31, 2005, Merchant Banking equity portfolio had a market value of approximately $940 compared to the 2004 value of approximately $507. In addition to an unrealized gain of approximately $344 during 2005, Merchant Banking purchased marketable equity securities of Shore Gold, Gabriel Resources and Miramar Mining for approximately $87, $31 and $27, respectively and sold Kinross equity securities for approximately $111. In addition, Merchant Banking sold Oxiana Resources equity securities for $78, of which, the majority were acquired from the sale of Golden Grove. During 2004, in addition to an unrealized gain of 64 Table of Contents approximately $123, Merchant Banking purchased marketable equity securities of Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel for approximately $200 and $19, respectively. On January 31, 2003, Kinross, Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and TVX Gold Inc. were combined, and TVX Gold acquired Newmont 49.9% interest in the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture. Under the terms of the combination and acquisition and through the efforts of Merchant Banking, Newmont received a 13.8% interest in the restructured Kinross in exchange for its then 45.67% interest in Echo Bay and $180 for its interest in TVX Newmont Americas. Newmont recognized a pre-tax gain of $84 on the transaction in Gain on investments, net during the first quarter of 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, Newmont sold a portion of its Kinross equity securities for total cash proceeds of $225 and recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $7. At June 30, 2004, Newmont recognized a $39 impairment of its investment in Kinross for an other-than-temporary decline in value in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Merchant Banking royalty interests and equity investments generated $79, $64 and $56 of Royalty and dividend income, net in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase from period-to-period was primarily attributable to steady performance from the gold and platinum group metals royalties coupled with higher gold and oil and gas prices. The 2005 and 2004 amounts included distributions received from Canadian Oil Sands Trust. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense related to Royalty and dividend income, net was $21, $24 and $26 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Merchant Banking also manages the Company interests in downstream gold refining and distribution businesses (40% interest in AGR Matthey Joint Venture and 50% interest in European Gold Refineries). Merchant Banking earned $4, $2, and $1 in Equity income of affiliates through its investments in AGR and EGR in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Merchant Banking value realization activities include managing the reserve delineation program on its 100% owned oil sands leases in Alberta, Canada, and advancing its other interests in coal, iron ore and gas. Merchant Banking provides advisory services to Newmont to assist it in managing its portfolio of operating and property interests. In 2005, Merchant Banking provided assistance in the sale of non-core properties including Golden Grove in Australia, Ovacik in Turkey and Mezcala in Mexico. In 2004, Merchant Banking assistance was provided in the sale of non-core properties including Bronzewing in Australia, Perama in Greece and Midwest Uranium in Canada. In addition, Merchant Banking participated in the restructuring of Australian Magnesium Corporation eliminating all remaining Newmont obligations (see Other Investing Activities below). In 2003, Merchant Banking advised Newmont on a variety of transactions including the process of extinguishing the majority of the bond and derivative liabilities of NYOL. These transactions gave rise to a Gain on extinguishment of NYOL liabilities, net of $221 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Total cash payments to extinguish the NYOL bonds and the NYOL derivatives liabilities (including costs) were $202 during the year ended December 31, 2003. For the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 Other Income attributable to the Merchant Banking Segment was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Royalty and dividend income $ 79 $ 64 $ 56 Gain (loss) on investments 54 (39 ) 83 Gain on sale of the Mezcala gold deposit 31 Gain on extinguishment of NYOL liabilities, net 221 Gain (loss) on QMC debt Guarantee 9 11 (30 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (34 ) Other 1 5 $ 174 $ 41 $ 296 65 Table of Contents Exploration Exploration expense was $147, $107, and $76 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Exploration expense in 2005 reflects higher funding of exploration and related activities in response to higher gold prices. Newmont anticipates it will expense between $155 and $160 on exploration activities in 2006. During 2005, Newmont replaced approximately 8.6 million equity gold ounces of depletion and divestitures with 9.4 million equity gold ounces of additions to proven and probable reserves. Exploration activities during 2005 succeeded in converting significant new reserves at Carlin open pits (1.9 million gold ounces), Conga (1.6 million equity gold ounces), Ahafo (1.6 million gold ounces), Akyem (1.1 million equity gold ounces), Yanacocha (1.0 million equity gold ounces), Tanami (0.6 million gold ounces) and Phoenix (0.6 million gold ounces). Exploration activities during 2004 primarily focused on the Conga district in Peru and the Phoenix deposit in Nevada. Newmont added 4.5 million equity gold ounces at Conga and 2.3 million gold ounces at Phoenix in 2004. Exploration also focused its activities on Newmont two projects in Ghana where reserves increased by 3.0 million gold ounces at Ahafo and 1.1 million equity gold ounces at Akyem in 2004. Exploration activities during 2003 primarily focused on the Conga district in Peru, various deposits at Nevada and Australian operations and the Ahafo and Akyem projects in Ghana. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates In addition to its domestic operations in the United States, Newmont has operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Uzbekistan, Bolivia and other foreign locations. The Company operations sell their production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on the Company revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 37%, 40% and 42% of Newmont Costs applicable to sales were paid in local currencies in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company Costs applicable to sales are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at Newmont foreign mining operations increased Costs applicable to sales approximately $15 in 2005 from 2004 and $57 in 2004 from 2003, primarily in Australia. Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on the Company determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact the Company cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in 66 Table of Contents reduced gold or copper sales and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization calculated using the units-of-production method and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which revised SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123R will supersede APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amend SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires measurement and recording to the financial statements of the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award, recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for such award. Newmont adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective application. Accordingly, compensation expense will be recognized for all newly granted awards and awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after January 1, 2006. Compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards that are outstanding as of January 1, 2006, based on the fair value at date of grant as calculated for our pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123, will be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period. Additionally, SFAS No. 123R requires the benefits of tax deductions different from recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. Compensation expense in the periods following adoption of SFAS No. 123R may differ from our pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123, based on changes in the fair value of our common stock, changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options, the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates, volatilities or other factors. At present FAS 123R compensation expense of between $25 and $30 for 2006 is expected. In March 2005, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107, Share-Based Payment, which provides guidance on the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as on the valuation of share-based payments. SAB No. 107 provides interpretive guidance related to valuation methods (including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term), first time adoption of SFAS No. 123R in an interim period, the classification of compensation expense and disclosures subsequent to adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We are currently evaluating the impact of SAB No. 107 on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry, (EITF 04-6) which addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable production costs that should be included as a component of inventory to be recognized in Costs applicable to sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. As a result, capitalization of stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period and the carrying value is less than the net realizable value. Newmont will adopt the provisions of EITF 04-6 on January 1, 2006. The most significant impact of adoption is expected to be the removal of deferred and advanced stripping costs from the balance sheet, net of taxes and minority interests, and reclassifying the balances as a cumulative effect adjustment reducing beginning retained earnings by approximately $75 to $85. Adoption of EITF 04-6 will have no impact on the Company cash position. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation 47 ( FIN 47 ), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB No. 143. FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement. FIN 47 requires a liability to be recognized for 67 Table of Contents the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 was effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2005 the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No. 154 established new standards on accounting for changes in accounting principles. SFAS No. 154 requires all such changes to be accounted for by retrospective application to the financial statements of prior periods unless prescribed otherwise or it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position Paper ( FSP ) 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments, superseding EITF 03-1. FSP 115-1 will replace the accounting guidance on the determination of whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired as set forth in EITF 03-1 with references to existing other-than-temporary impairment guidance. FSP 115-1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Adoption of FSP 115-1 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources For 2005, Net cash provided from continuing operations was $1,253, compared to $1,549 and $645 for 2004 and 2003, respectively, and was significantly impacted by the following key factors: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Consolidated gold ounces sold (in thousands) 8,552.0 8,828.9 8,377.4 Average price received per ounce of gold (1) $ 441 $ 412 $ 365 Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold sold (2) $ 236 $ 216 $ 195 Consolidated copper pounds sold (in millions) 572.7 683.3 N/A Average price received per pound of copper (1) $ 1.45 $ 1.33 $ N/A Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper sold (2) $ 0.53 $ 0.45 $ N/A (1) Before treatment and refining charges. (2) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization. Net cash provided from continuing operations decreased 10% in 2005 compared to 2004, impacted by 276,900 fewer gold ounces and 110.6 million fewer copper pounds sold. The reduction in sales volume was offset by higher realized prices before treatment and refining charges. Net cash provided from continuing operations was also impacted by the physical delivery of 161,111 ounces under the Prepaid Forward Sales obligation which resulted in the recognition of $48 of non-cash revenue in 2005. Also impacting operating cash flows during 2005 were higher operating costs, as discussed above in Results of Consolidated Operations, and a $189 increase in inventories, stockpiles and ore on leach pads. Operating cash flow during 2004 compared to 2003 was impacted by the consolidation of Batu Hijau effective January 1, 2004, and higher realized gold and copper prices, partially offset by higher costs at virtually all operations and lower ounces sold. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $977, $1,432 and $380 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, with Additions to property, plant and mine development, of $1,226, $683 and $484 for continuing operations in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additionally, approximately $25, $35 and $21 was spent on capital expenditures for the discontinued operations of Golden Grove and Holloway in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 68 Table of Contents Additions to Property, Plant and Mine Development Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Nevada, USA $ 479 $ 169 $ 112 Yanacocha, Peru 225 232 206 Australia/New Zealand: Pajingo, Australia 12 11 15 Yandal, Australia 25 19 17 Tanami, Australia 19 18 40 Kalgoorlie, Australia 12 27 15 Martha, New Zealand 11 7 12 Other, Australia 19 7 2 98 89 101 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 65 35 Ghana, West Africa: Ahafo, Ghana 258 83 13 Akyem, Ghana 18 9 8 276 92 21 Other Operations: Kori Kollo, Bolivia 22 4 1 Zarafshan, Uzbekistan 6 9 8 La Herradura, Mexico 2 4 3 Ovacik, Turkey 9 6 Golden Giant, Canada 2 30 28 18 Exploration 1 Merchant Banking 4 5 2 Corporate and Other 49 33 23 $ 1,226 $ 683 $ 484 Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2005 included $73 for the development of the Leeville underground mine, $43 for the power plant, $226 for the development of the Phoenix project, and other sustaining capital.

Approximately 58% of the capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments and the remaining portion is allocated to new project development and business improvement initiatives. In February 2006, Newmont entered into an agreement to acquire Newcrest Mining Limited 22.22% interest in Boddington. Consideration for the purchase is A$225 before applicable stamp duty and similar costs. When the transaction closes, Newmont interest in Boddington will increase to two-thirds. Closing of the transaction is subject to Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and Western Australia Ministry of Mines approval, expected by April 2006. Estimated capital expenditures for 2006 will increase by $47 as a result of the acquisition of Newcrest interest in Boddington.

Corporate Revolving Credit Facilities Through July 29, 2004, the Company had three uncollateralized revolving credit facilities with a consortium of banks: a $200 U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility with an initial term of 364 days that was permitted to be extended annually to no later than October 2006; a $400 multi-currency revolving credit facility that matured in October 2006 and provided for borrowing in U.S., Canadian and Australian dollars, and which also contained a letter of credit sub-facility; and a $150 multi-currency revolving credit facility that was to mature in May 2005 and provided for borrowing in U.S. and Australian dollars. Interest rates and facility fees varied based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bore interest at a rate per annum equa1 to either the LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.45% to 1.25% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the lead bank prime rate plus a margin ranging from 0% to 0.25%. Facility fees were accrued at a rate per annum ranging from 0.10% to 0.40% of the commitment. Effective July 30, 2004, the Company entered into a new uncollateralized $1,250 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks. This revolving credit facility replaced the three existing revolving credit facilities which were cancelled upon the effectiveness of the new facility. The facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contains a letter of credit sub-facility. In July 2005, the Company amended its revolving credit facility, extending the final maturity one year, to July 28, 2010. In addition, certain adjustments to pricing and structure were also made. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.22% to 1.00% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the lead bank prime. Facility fees accrue at a rate per annum ranging from 0.080% to 0.250% of the aggregate commitments. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 0.10% on the amount of revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. At December 31, 2005, the facility fees were 0.09% of the commitment. There was $275 outstanding under the letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2005. Prepaid Forward Sales Contract Under the prepaid forward gold sales contract (the Prepaid Forward ) and forward gold purchase contract (the Forward Purchase ) the Company is obligated to sell 322,222 ounces of gold, to be delivered in June of 2006 and 2007 in annual installments of 161,111 ounces and to deliver 17,951 ounces of gold in June and December of 2006 and June of 2007. The Forward Purchase provides for purchases of 17,951 ounces of gold on each delivery date under the Prepaid Forward at an average of $344 per ounce in 2006 and $354 per ounce in 2007. 72 Table of Contents The Company may also be entitled to receive additional proceeds in connection with the annual deliveries of 161,111 ounces, to be determined at each delivery date based on the excess, if any, of the then market price for gold (up to a maximum of $380 per ounce) over $300 per ounce. During June 2005, 161,111 ounces were delivered in connection with the first annual delivery, resulting in a non-cash reduction in debt of $48. Remaining scheduled repayments are $48 in 2006 and 2007. Using relevant future market conditions and financial models, the estimated negative fair value of these contracts was approximately $159 and $205 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Debt Covenants Certain of Newmont current debt facilities contain various common public debt covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. These debt instruments include the 5 7 / 8 % notes, Newmont Australia 7 5 / 8 % notes, 8 5 / 8 % debentures, and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant. None of the aforementioned public debt instruments contain financial ratio covenants or credit rating provisions that could create liquidity issues for the Company. In addition to the covenants noted above, the revolving credit facility contains financial ratio covenants requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash) to EBITDA (Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total capitalization ratio (ratio of net debt to total capitalization, which includes owner equity retained earnings and fixed assets) of less than or equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company assets and a negative pledge on certain assets. Certain of the Company project debt facilities contain various common project debt covenants and default provisions including limitations on dividends subject to certain debt service cover ratios, limitations on sales of assets, negative pledges on certain assets, change of control provisions and limitations of additional permitted debt. At December 31, 2005, the Company and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants and default provisions. Scheduled Debt Payments During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company made scheduled cash debt repayments of $218 and a scheduled non-cash debt repayment of $48 for the Prepaid Forward. Scheduled minimum debt repayments are $196 in 2006, $162 in 2007, $232 in 2008, $114 in 2009, $113 in 2010 and $1,112 thereafter. Newmont expects to be able to fund maturities of its debt from Net cash provided by operating activities and existing cash balances . Shelf Registration Statement In January 2004, Newmont filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables it to issue debt and equity securities from time-to-time having an aggregate offering price up to $1,000. Newmont also filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 which enables it to issue, from time-to-time in connection with acquisitions of businesses, properties or assets, common stock and common stock warrants having an aggregate offering price of $200. These registration statements were declared effective on February 4, 2004. Common Stock Offering During November 2003, Newmont completed an equity offering for 25 million shares of its common stock under its then existing shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proceeds of approximately $1,027 from this offering were used for general corporate purposes. This was the only public offering during the last three years. 73 Table of Contents Dividends The Company paid dividends of $0.40 per common share during 2005, $0.30 per common share during 2004, and $0.17 per common share during 2003.

The Company also paid dividends of $186, $237 and $146 to minority interests during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Contractual Obligations Newmont contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt (1) $ 2,974 $ 282 $ 680 $ 475 $ 1,537 Capital lease obligations (1) 362 37 106 68 151 Remediation and reclamation obligations (2) 788 66 133 70 519 Employee-related benefits (3) 386 76 126 35 149 Operating leases 21 4 11 5 1 Minimum royalty payments 134 6 54 22 52 Purchase obligations (4) 429 150 211 52 16 Other (5) 344 163 149 14 18 $ 5,438 $ 784 $ 1,470 $ 741 $ 2,443 (1) Amounts represent principal and estimated interest payments assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, the Company is required to close its operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these remediation and reclamation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding remediation and reclamation liabilities, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefits include severance, pension funding and other benefit plans. Pension plan funding beyond 2010 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. (4) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (5) Other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the Company Consolidated Financial Statements include labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases as disclosed in the above table and $386 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). There is also an undrawn contingent sponsor support line of credit to Batu Hijau of $65, of which Newmont pro rata share is $37. 74 Table of Contents Batu Hijau has sales agreements to sell copper concentrates as follows (in millions of pounds) 1,614 in 2006; 1,362 in 2007; 1,378 in 2008; 1,389 in 2009; 1,389 in 2010 and 4,167 thereafter. For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. Future Cash Flows The Company expects to use cash for capital expenditures (see Investing Activities, below), to fund the Exploration and Merchant Banking Segments (see Results of Operations, above) and to service debt. For information on the Company long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Newmont believes it will be able to fund all existing obligations from either Net cash provided by operating activities or cash and marketable debt securities on hand. Subject to any significant adverse changes in the Company long-term view of gold and copper prices, the Company has both the ability and intention to fund from Net cash provided by operating activities, the exploration expenditures and Merchant Banking investments that were assumed in the goodwill valuations to support the Exploration and Merchant Banking Segments. The Company believes it will be able to raise funds as needed in the future as opportunities for expansion arise. Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized spot price of gold and copper. The Company has a series of price-capped gold sales contracts under which it will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $384 per ounce in 2008, $381 per ounce in 2009 to $392 per ounce in 2011. The Company also has copper collar contracts for 490 million pounds under which it will realize a minimum and maximum price of $1.10 and $1.35 per pound, respectively, in 2006 and $1.10 and $1.40 per pound, respectively, in 2007. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont Net cash provided by operating activities to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian dollar. For information concerning the sensitivity of the Company Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. The Company has entered into Australian dollar net zero-cost collar contracts under which it will purchase Australian dollars at a minimum average floor price of $0.55 and average maximum cap price of $0.80 per Australian dollar in 2006. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont Net cash provided to operating activities to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Based on Newmont production profile for the next three years and proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2005, without considering future additions to such reserves, Newmont expects that consolidated gold ounces sold will be between 7.8 and 8.2 million ounces in 2006 and will be between 7.2 and 7.6 million ounces in 2007. The Company does not anticipate that reasonably expected variations in gold or copper sales alone will influence its ability to pay its debt and other obligations over that period. On December 19, 2005, Yanacocha filed with the Peruvian securities regulatory authority (CONASEV), for its review and approval, a prospectus to register a $200 bond program in the Peruvian public market. When approved, the registration would make the bond program available for Yanacocha to make up to $200 in issuances over a two-year period. Yanacocha may also consider obtaining funds from other sources, including commercial banks. Any funds generated from the bond program or other debt facilities may be used by Yanacocha for capital expenditures and its general corporate purposes. In January 2006, the International Finance Corporation approved $125 in project financing for the Ahafo project. The financing is subject to satisfactory final documentation and syndication to commercial banks. The Company expects to close and drawdown on the facility prior to mid-year. 75 Table of Contents In February 2006, Newmont entered into an agreement to acquire Newcrest Mining Limited 22.22% interest in Boddington. Consideration for the purchase is A$225 before applicable stamp duty and similar costs. When the transaction closes, Newmont interest in Boddington will increase to two-thirds. Closing of the transaction is subject to Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and Western Australia Ministry of Mines approval, expected by April 2006. Environmental The Company mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $431 and $396, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties, of which $53 is classified as current liabilities expected to be spent in 2006. In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Company best estimate of its liability for these matters, $77 and $75 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 101% greater or 34% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2005. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Other expenses in the period estimates are revised. Newmont spent $14, $20 and $19 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and has classified $10 as a current liability expected to be spent in 2006. Expenditures for 2005 and 2004 related primarily to legacy Normandy properties in Australia, the McCoy/Cove property in central Nevada and the Dawn mill site near Ford, Washington. Expenditures for 2003 related primarily to the Dawn mill site and the McCoy/Cove property. Included in capital expenditures were $35, $43 and $26 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Expenditures of between $30 and $40 and anticipated in 2006. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of Costs applicable to sales .
