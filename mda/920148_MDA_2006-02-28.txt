Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General During 2005, the Company continued to strengthen its financial performance through the implementation of the Company strategic plan and the expansion of its national platform in routine testing. This plan continues to provide growth opportunities for the Company by building a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies primarily through internal development efforts, acquisitions and technology licensing activities. The Company believes future performance will be positively affected by several factors: 1) The expansion of higher-value genomic tests such as Cystic Fibrosis, HCV and HIV genotyping, along with the continued growth of HIV viral load and HPV testing; 2) Transition to Cytyc ThinPrep Imaging System; 3) Continued progress with existing licensing and business relationships (such as EXACT Sciences, Atherotech, Liposcience, and BioPredictive); 4) The Company ongoing business acquisition strategy; and 5) Growing demand for genomic testing creating a positive shift in test mix toward higher value testing. Continued Development of Genomic, Esoteric, and Anatomic Pathology Services The Company acquisitions of Dianon, US LABS, and Esoterix position the Company as the leading provider of cancer and specialty testing in the United States. At the end of December approximately 35 percent of the Company revenues are in the genomic, esoteric, and anatomic pathology categories. Prior to the acquisition of Dianon, only 27 percent of the Company revenues were derived from these testing categories. In addition to greater revenue and earnings potential, these acquisitions provide the Company the opportunity to reassess the cost structure of our entire organization to eliminate any redundant functions and costs wherever they may exist. The Company third quarter restructuring marks the beginning of the implementation of these integration efforts. In connection with these acquisitions, the Company expects to ultimately achieve cost reductions of approximately thirty million dollars on a pre-tax basis over time compared to the current run-rate. Cytyc ThinPrep Imaging System The acceptance of the Cytyc ThinPrep Imaging System continues to accelerate as more physicians become aware of this service and the benefits that it provides to them and to their patients. This new service offers both enhanced quality to clients and their patients as well as enhanced efficiency to the Company labs. By the end of the fourth quarter, the ThinPrep Imaging System was being requested for approximately 31 percent of all liquid-based Pap smears ordered, up from approximately 5 percent at the end of the first quarter. On an annualized run-rate basis, this means that the Company is now performing approximately 2.3 million imaged guided Pap tests. This significant adoption rate clearly indicates that physicians recognize the benefits of this Pap screening technology advancement. Managed Care The Company growth is fueled not only by the introduction of new testing capabilities, but also by expanding and strengthening relationships with managed care partners. A major driver of volume growth this year is a result of managed care relationships. Effective October 1, 2005, the Company was awarded the exclusive national provider contract for WellPoint PPO in the entire state of Georgia. Additionally, the Company was awarded the exclusive national lab provider contract for the Wellpoint HMO and PPO fee for service plans in Nevada effective October 15, 2005. (34) During 2005, the Company continued to strengthen relationships with its national managed care partners through three major initiatives. First, by helping managed care companies understand how the Company can help reduce their overall laboratory spending while still allowing for fair payment for the services that the Company provides. Control of leakage the amount of work performed and billed by non-contracted providers remains a major area of cost reduction opportunity for managed care companies. Second, by providing managed care companies with unique scientific capabilities both in traditional clinical and anatomic pathology services, and in break-through areas such as wellness. Third, by bringing unique connectivity and information aggregation and analysis solutions to our managed care partners. Seasonality The majority of the Company testing volume is dependent on patient visits to doctor offices and other providers of health care. Volume of testing generally declines during the year-end holiday periods and other major holidays. In addition, volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues and cash flows. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year. (35) Results of Operations (in millions) Years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 Net Sales Years Ended December 31, % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Net Sales Routine Testing $ 2,197 .8 $ 2,118 .3 $ 2,050 .3 3.8% 3.3% Genomic and Esoteric 1,129 .8 966 .5 889 .1 16.9% 8.7% Total $ 3,327 .6 $ 3,084 .8 $ 2,939 .4 7.9% 4.9% Number of Accessions Years Ended December 31, % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Volume Routine Testing 74 .8 75 .3 73 .6 (0.7% ) 2.3% Genomic and Esoteric 17 .3 15 .8 14 .3 9.5% 10.5% Total 92 .1 91 .1 87 .9 1.1% 3.6% Price Per Accession(PPA) Years Ended December 31, % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Price Routine Testing $ 29 .38 $ 28 .12 $ 27 .84 4.5% 1.0% Genomic and Esoteric 65 .26 61 .18 62 .28 6.7% (1.8% ) Total 36 .12 33 .86 33 .43 6.7% 1.3% The increase in net sales for the three years ended December 31, 2005 has been driven primarily by the Company continued shift in test mix to higher priced genomic and esoteric tests. As a percentage of total net sales, genomic and esoteric tests have increased during the three year period ended December 31, 2005 from 30.2% in 2003 to 34.0% in 2005. The acquisitions of US Labs and Esoterix in 2005 will continue to build on the Company leadership position in the genomic and esoteric market. In addition to a shift in test mix, net sales were positively impacted in 2005 by improved pricing in routine testing. The improvement in routine test pricing was the result of several factors including our emphasis on pricing discipline and the loss of a large capitated contract in Florida and a large hospital laboratory agreement. Cost of Sales Years Ended December 31, % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Cost of Sales $ 1,937 .3 $ 1,795 .5 $ 1,714 .8 7.9% 4.7% Cost of sales which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs has increased over the three year period ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increased volume in genomic and esoteric testing and the impact of acquisitions. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales has remained relatively stable over the three year period ended December 31, 2005. Labor and testing supplies comprise over 74% of the Company cost of sales. (36) Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Years Ended December 31, % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 703 .9 $ 649 .1 $ 651 .8 8.4% (0.4% ) SG&A as a % of sales 21.2% 21.0% 22.2% Total selling, general and administrative expenses as percentage of sales have decreased over the three year period, primarily due to the reduction in the companies bad debt expense rate. The bad debt expense rate as percentage of sales was 5.4%, 6.3% and 7.3% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. The decrease in the bad debt expense rate is the result of improved billing and collection performance. Other SG&A remained relatively flat in 2004 and increased significantly in 2005 as the Company began the integration of the Esoterix and US LABS acquisitions. The Company recorded $11.9 million in restructuring charges during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 in connection with the integration process and expects to ultimately realize savings of approximately thirty million dollars on a pre-tax basis over time compared to the current run-rate. Selling, general and administrative expenses have also increased due to the Company investment in the sales force. Amortization of intangibles and other assets Years Ended December 31, % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Amortization of intangibles and other assets $ 51 .4 $ 42 .7 $ 37 .6 20.4% 13.6% Amortization of intangibles and other assets is driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions and licensed technology. The increase during 2005 was driven primarily by the impact of the Esoterix and US LABS acquisitions. The increase during 2004 was related primarily to licensed technology as well as small acquisitions. Investment Loss Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Investment loss $ (3.1 ) $ -- $ -- During the second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded an investment loss of $3.1, related to a write-off of the value of warrants to purchase common stock of Exact Sciences Corporation ( Exact ), which were obtained as part of the Company licensing agreement for Exact PreGen Plus technology in 2002. The original term of the warrants expired in June 2005. Restructuring and other special charges Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Restructuring and other special charges $ 16.9 $ (0.9 ) $ 1.5 During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, the Company began to implement its plan related to the integration of Esoterix and US LABS operations into the Company service delivery network. The plan is directed at reducing redundant facilities, while maintaining the goal of providing excellent customer service. In connection with the integration plan, the Company recorded $11.9 million of costs associated with the execution of the plan. The majority of these integration costs related to employee severance and contractual obligations associated with leased facilities and equipment. Of this amount, $10.1 million (37) related to employee severance benefits for approximately 700 employees, with the remainder primarily related to contractual obligations associated with leased facilities. Employee groups being affected as a result of this plan included those involved in the collection and testing of specimens, as well as administrative and other support functions. The Company also recorded a special charge of $5.0 million related to forgiveness of amounts owed by patients and clients as well as other costs associated with the areas of the Gulf Coast severely impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded certain adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges due to changes in estimates, resulting in a credit of approximately of $0.9 million. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $3.3 million in connection with the integration of DIANON. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $3.1 million, relating to the continuing integration of its recent acquisitions. The Company also recorded certain adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2003 to previously recorded restructuring charges due to changes in estimates, resulting in a credit of approximately $4.9 million. Interest expense Years Ended December 31, % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Interest expense $ 34 .4 $ 36 .1 $ 40 .9 (4.7% ) (11.7% ) The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 was a direct result of debt reductions following the Company financing of the DIANON acquisition in 2003. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 is primarily the result of the completion of amortization of deferred fees associated with the zero coupon-subordinated notes in 2004. Income from joint venture partnerships Years Ended December 31, % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Income from joint venture partnerships $ 58 .3 $ 51 .3 $ 43 .7 13.6% 17.4% Income from investments in joint venture partnerships represents the Company ownership share in joint venture partnerships acquired as part of the Dynacare acquisition on July 25, 2002. The increase in income from these investments is driven primarily by improvement in operational performance. A significant portion of this income is derived from investments in Ontario and Alberta, Canada, and is earned in Canadian dollars. Income tax expense Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Income tax expense $ 254 .5 $ 252 .3 $ 219 .4 Income tax expense as a % of income before tax 39.7% 41.0% 40.6% The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by a deduction for certain dividends received in 2005. (38) Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position The Company strong cash-generating capability and financial condition provide ready access to capital markets. The Company principal source of liquidity is operating cash flow. This cash-generating capability is one of the Company fundamental strengths and provides substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating, investing and financing needs. In addition, the Company has revolving credit facilities that are further discussed in Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Activities In 2005, the Company operations provided $574.2 million of cash, primarily reflecting the Company solid business results, offset by net tax payments of $233.3 million and pension plan contributions of $8.0 million. The growth in the Company cash flow from operations primarily resulted from improved earnings and the expansion of the business through acquisitions. The Company continued to focus on efforts to increase cash collections from all payers, as well as on-going improvements to the claim submission processes. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company made contributions to its defined pension plan in the amounts of $8.0 million, $60.0 million and $18.3 million, respectively. The Company expects to contribute $8.0 million to its defined benefit pension plan during 2006. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the Company pension and postretirement plans. Investing Activities Capital expenditures were $93.6 million, $95.0 million and $83.6 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company expects capital expenditures of approximately $100.0 to $115.0 million in 2006. The Company will continue to make important investments in information technology connectivity with its customers and financial systems. Such expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations as well as borrowings under the Company revolving credit facilities. The Company has invested a total of $28.3 million over the past three years in new testing technologies and had $60.5 million net book value of capitalized patents, licenses and technology at December 31, 2005. While the Company continues to believe its strategy of entering into licensing and technology distribution agreements with the developers of leading-edge technologies will provide future growth in revenues, there are certain risks associated with these investments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that the licensed technology will not gain broad acceptance in the marketplace; or that insurance companies, managed care organizations, or Medicare and Medicaid will not approve reimbursement for these tests at a level commensurate with the costs of running the tests. Any or all of these circumstances could result in impairment in the value of the related capitalized licensing costs. Financing Activities During 2005, the Company repurchased $588.7 million of stock representing 11.6 million shares. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding authorizations to purchase approximately $285.2 million. Holders of the zero coupon-subordinated notes may require the Company to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes on September 11, 2006 and 2011 at prices of $741.92 to $819.54 per note, respectively. Should the holders put the notes to the Company on any of the dates above, the Company believes that it will be able to satisfy this contingent obligation with cash on hand, borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and additional financing if necessary. Credit Ratings The Company debt ratings of Baa3 from Moody and BBB from Standard and Poor contribute to our ability to access capital markets. (39) Contractual Cash Obligations Payments Due by Period Total 2006 2007- 2008 2009- 2010 2010 and thereafter Capital lease obligations $ 4.0 $ 2.2 $ 1.8 $ -- $ -- Operating lease obligations 249.3 68.1 87.0 43.1 51.1 Contingent future licensing payments (a) 52.4 0.6 22.3 11.4 18.1 Minimum royalty payments 35.3 6.5 12.8 11.3 4.7 Minimum purchase obligations 30.3 10.3 20.0 -- -- Zero coupon-subordinated notes (b) 552.0 552.0 -- -- -- Scheduled interest payments on Senior Notes 285.0 33.3 66.6 66.6 118.5 Long-term debt 604.5 0.2 0.2 0.2 603.9 Total contractual cash obligations(c) $ 1,812.8 $ 673.2 $ 210.7 $ 132.6 $ 796.3 (a) Contingent future licensing payments will be made if certain events take place, such as the launch of a specific test, the transfer of certain technology, and when specified revenue milestones are met. (b) Holders of the zero coupon-subordinated notes may require the Company to purchase in cash all or a portion of their notes on September 11, 2006 and 2011 at $741.92 and $819.54 per note, respectively. Should the holders put the notes to the Company on any of the dates above, the Company believes that it will be able to satisfy this contingent obligation with cash on hand, borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and additional financing if necessary. (c) The table does not include obligations under the Company pension and postretirement benefit plans which are included in Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company expects to contribute approximately $8 million to its defined pension plan during 2006, although it is not legally required to do so. Benefits under the Company postretirement medical plan are made when claims are submitted for payment, the timing of which are not practicable to estimate. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have transactions or relationships with special purpose entities, and the Company does not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases. On December 7, 2005, the Company executed an overnight share repurchase transaction with a bank for the acquisition of 4.8 million shares of the Company outstanding common stock for an initial purchase price of $52.04 per share. Pursuant to the agreement with the bank, the bank will purchase 4.8 million shares in the open market over a period ending no later than June 13, 2006. At the end of the purchase period, the Company will either receive from or pay to the bank a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average purchase price of the shares acquired compared to the initial purchase price. Such price adjustment can be either in cash or common stock at the discretion of the Company. The Company has limited its potential financial exposure in the event of an increase in its share price above a cap during the purchase period with respect to 2.4 million of the repurchased shares. At December 31, 2005, the price adjustment would have required the Company to pay $5.3 million in cash or common stock. Other Commercial Commitments At December 31, 2005, the Company provided letters of credit aggregating approximately $62.6 million, primarily in connection with certain insurance programs. These letters of credit are secured by the Company senior credit facilities and are renewed annually, around mid-year. Based on current and projected levels of operations, coupled with availability under its new senior credit facilities, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet both its short-term and long-term cash needs. (40) New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004 the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued FAS 123(R), Share-Based Payment (revised 2004). This Statement is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This Statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. This Statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. The Company currently estimates the adoption to impact net income by approximately $15.0, net of tax. This Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in Statement 123 as originally issued and EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. This Statement does not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans, which are subject to AICPA Statement of Position 93-6, Employers Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans. In March, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. This Interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Thus, the timing and (or) method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and (or) through the normal operation of the asset. Uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. Statement 143 acknowledges that in some cases, sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This Interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This Interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect that this standard will impact its financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2005. This statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes (APB 20) and SFAS No. 3 Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements . APB 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including, in net income of the period of the change, the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The Company does not expect that this standard will impact its financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets. This Statement amends the guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. That statement is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The Company has not historically entered into a significant level of nonmonetary transactions and therefore does not expect that this standard will impact its financial position or results unless nonmonetary transactions are (41) utilized in the future. This statement is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Company critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following: Allowances for doubtful accounts Pension expense Accruals for self insurance reserves Income tax expense Allowance for doubtful accounts Revenue is recognized for services rendered when test results are reported to the ordering physician and the testing process is complete. The Company sales are generally billed to three types of payers clients, patients and third parties, such as managed care companies, Medicare and Medicaid. For clients, sales are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at the Company client list price, less any negotiated discount. Patient sales are recorded at the Company patient fee schedule, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients. The Company bills third party payers in two ways fee-for-service and capitated agreements. Fee-for-service third party payers are billed at the Company patient fee schedule amount, and third party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. These discounts are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule that is maintained for each third party payer. The majority of the Company third party sales are recorded using an actual or contracted fee schedule at the time of sale. For the remaining third party sales, estimated fee schedules are maintained for each payer. Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to revenue. These adjustments are not material to the Company results of operations in any period presented. The Company periodically adjusts these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends. Under capitated agreements with managed care companies, the Company recognizes revenue based on a negotiated monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the number or costs of services performed. The Company has a formal process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding. Bad debt expense is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales considered necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level. The Company process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment, and considers such factors as the age of the underlying receivables, historical and projected collection experience, and other external factors that could affect the collectibility of its receivables. Accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company write off policy (e.g. when they are deemed to be uncollectible). In the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance, accounts are progressively reserved based on the historical timing of cash collections relative to their respective aging categories within the Company receivables. These collection and reserve processes, along with the close monitoring of the billing process, help reduce the risks of material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection or reimbursement experience. (42) The following table presents the percentage of the Company net accounts receivable outstanding by aging category at December 31, 2005 and 2004: Days Outstanding 2005 2004 0 - 30 43.6% 47.3% 31 - 61 22.3% 19.2% 61 - 91 10.1% 10.1% 91 - 120 7.3% 6.7% 121 - 150 4.6% 5.1% 151 - 180 3.6% 3.9% 181 - 270 6.6% 6.0% 271 - 360 1.4% 1.4% Over 360 0.5% 0.3% Pension Expense Substantially all employees of the Company are covered by a defined benefit retirement plan (the Company Plan ). The benefits to be paid under the Company Plan are based on years of credited service and compensation earned while an employee of LabCorp. The Company has a second defined benefit plan which covers its senior management group and provides for additional benefits, due in part to limitations on benefits and pay imposed on the Company Plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Company net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year. The Company is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The key assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plans were a 5.6% discount rate and an 8.5% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets as of December 31, 2005. Discount Rate The Company works with its independent actuary to develop a discount rate assumption used to value the benefit obligations of its retirement plans. The Company follows paragraph 186 of Financial Accounting Standard 106 in developing this rate. The Company actuary obtains information on high-quality corporate (AA rating or higher) bonds from a nationally recognized credit rating agency. These bonds are then reviewed and outliers are discarded. The results of the actuary discount rate analysis are then reviewed by the Company and a final decision on the discount rate assumption is made by the Company. A one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in 2005 pension expense of $3.4 million. Return on Plan Assets In establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption, the Company reviews its asset allocation and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses. Actual asset over/under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease/increase unrecognized loss. The change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods. A one percentage point increase in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in 2005 pension expense of $2.5 million. Current year net pension cost was $9.8 million, a decrease of $1.5 million from 2004. Our actuaries have estimated that 2006 net pension cost will be higher by approximately $4.8 million than 2005 net pension cost. The decrease in the discount rate assumption during fiscal 2005 is a primary reason for this expected increase in net pension cost for 2006. Further information on our defined benefit retirement plan is provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. (43) Accruals for Self-insurance Reserves Accruals for self-insurance reserves (including workers compensation, auto and employee medical) are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history, along with current and estimated future economic conditions. The Company is self-insured for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business, generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results. The Company records an accrual for such claims payable and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial assessment of the accrual driven by frequency and amounts of claims, which is performed at least annually. While management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature, estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company Audit Committee periodically reviews the Company significant accounting policies. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of significant accounting policies. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.
