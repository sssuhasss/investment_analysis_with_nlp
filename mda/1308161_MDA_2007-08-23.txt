OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY S BUSINESS The Company is a diversified entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in eight segments: Filmed Entertainment , which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide. Television , which principally consists of the operation of 35 full power broadcast television stations, including nine duopolies, in the United States (of these stations, 25 are affiliated with the FOX network and ten are affiliated with the MyNetworkTV network), the broadcasting of network programming in the United States and the development, production and broadcasting of television programming in Asia. Cable Network Programming , which principally consists of the licensing and production of programming distributed through cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite ( DBS ) operators primarily in the United States. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television , which principally consists of the distribution of premium programming services via satellite and broadband directly to subscribers in Italy. Magazines and Inserts , which principally consists of the publication of free-standing inserts, which are promotional booklets containing consumer offers distributed through insertion in local Sunday newspapers in the United States, and the provision of in-store marketing products and services, primarily to consumer packaged goods manufacturers, in the United States and Canada. Newspapers , which principally consists of the publication of four national newspapers in the United Kingdom, the publication of approximately 145 newspapers in Australia and the publication of a mass circulation, metropolitan morning newspaper in the United States. Book Publishing , which principally consists of the publication of English language books throughout the world. Other , which includes NDS Group Plc ( NDS ), a company engaged in the business of supplying open end-to-end digital technology and services to digital pay-television platform operators and content providers; News Outdoor Group ( News Outdoor ), an advertising business which offers display advertising primarily in outdoor locations throughout Russia and Eastern Europe; and Fox Interactive Media ( FIM ), which operates the Company Internet activities. Filmed Entertainment The Filmed Entertainment segment derives revenue from the production and distribution of feature motion pictures and television series. In general, motion pictures produced or acquired for distribution by the Company are exhibited in U.S. and foreign theaters, followed by DVDs, pay-per-view television, premium subscription television, network television and basic cable and syndicated television exploitation. Television series initially produced for the networks and first-run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and international markets concurrently and subsequently released in seasonal DVD box sets. More successful series are later syndicated in domestic markets. The length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production and, therefore, may cause fluctuations in operating results. License 44 Table of Contents fees received for television exhibition (including international and U.S. premium television and basic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the period that licensed films or programs are available for such exhibition, which may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. The revenues and operating results of the Filmed Entertainment segment are significantly affected by the timing of the Company theatrical and home entertainment releases, the number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks and the number of its television series in off-network syndication. Theatrical and home entertainment release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the marketplace. The distribution windows for the release of motion pictures theatrically and in various home entertainment formats have been compressing and may continue to change in the future. A reduction in timing between theatrical and home entertainment releases could adversely affect the revenues and operating results of this segment. The Company enters into arrangements with third parties to co-produce many of its theatrical productions. These arrangements, which are referred to as co-financing arrangements, take various forms. The parties to these arrangements include studio and non-studio entities, both domestic and foreign. In several of these agreements, other parties control certain distribution rights. The Filmed Entertainment segment records the amounts received for the sale of an economic interest as a reduction of the cost of the film, as the investor assumes full risk for that portion of the film asset acquired in these transactions. The substance of these arrangements is that the third-party investors own an interest in the film and, therefore, receive a participation based on the third-party investor interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film. Consistent with the requirements of Statement of Position 00-2, Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films ( SOP 00-2 ), the estimate of the third-party investor interest in profits or losses incurred on the film is determined by reference to the ratio of actual revenue earned to date in relation to total estimated ultimate revenues. Operating costs incurred by the Filmed Entertainment segment include: exploitation costs, primarily theatrical prints and advertising and home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs; amortization of capitalized production, overhead and interest costs; and participations and talent residuals. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. The Company competes with other major studios, such as Disney, Paramount, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros., and independent film producers in the production and distribution of motion pictures and DVDs. As a producer and distributor of television programming, the Company competes with studios, television production groups and independent producers and syndicators, such as Disney, Sony, NBC Universal, Warner Bros. and Paramount Television, to sell programming both domestically and internationally. The Company also competes to obtain creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of the Company filmed entertainment businesses. Television and Cable Network Programming The Company U.S. television operations primarily consist of the FOX Broadcasting Company ( FOX ), MyNetworkTV, Inc. ( MyNetworkTV ) and the 35 television stations owned by the Company. The Company international television operations consist primarily of STAR Group Limited ( STAR ). The U.S. television broadcast environment is highly competitive and the primary methods of competition are the development and acquisition of popular programming. Program success is measured by ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, with the top rated programs commanding the highest advertising prices. FOX and MyNetworkTV compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks, such as CBS, ABC, NBC and The CW, independent television stations, cable program services, as well as other media, including DBS services, DVDs, video games, print and the Internet. In addition, FOX and MyNetworkTV compete with the other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the country. 45 Table of Contents The television stations owned by the Company compete for programming, audiences and advertising revenues with other television stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and in the case of advertising revenues, with other local and national media. The competitive position of the television stations owned by the Company is largely influenced by the strength of FOX and MyNetworkTV, and, in particular, the prime-time viewership of the respective network, as well as the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not programmed by FOX and MyNetworkTV. In Asia, STAR channels are primarily distributed to local cable operators or other pay-television platform operators for distribution to their subscribers. STAR derives its revenue from the sale of advertising time and affiliate fees from these pay-television platform operators. The Company U.S. cable network operations primarily consist of the Fox News Channel ( Fox News ), the FX Network ( FX ) and the Regional Sports Networks ( RSNs ). The Company international cable networks consist of the Fox International Channels ( FIC ) with operations primarily in Latin America and Europe. Generally, the Company cable networks, which target various demographics, derive a majority of their revenues from monthly affiliate fees received from cable television systems and DBS operators based on the number of its subscribers. Affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to a cable operator or DBS operator to facilitate the launch of a cable network). The Company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Cable television and DBS are currently the predominant means of distribution of the Company program services in the United States. Internationally, distribution technology varies region by region. The Company cable networks compete for carriage on cable television systems, DBS systems and other distribution systems with other program services, as well as other uses of bandwidth, such as retransmission of free over-the-air broadcast networks, telephony and data transmission. A primary focus of competition is for distribution of the Company cable network channels that are not already distributed by particular cable television or DBS systems. For such program services, distributors make decisions on the use of bandwidth based on various considerations, including amounts paid by programmers for launches, subscription fees payable by distributors and appeal to the distributors subscribers. The most significant operating expenses of the Television segment and the Cable Network Programming segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming and the production and technical expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcaster or cable network. Other expenses include promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the broadcaster or cable network and its programming. Additional expenses include sales commissions paid to the in-house advertising sales force, as well as salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses. The Company has several multi-year sports rights agreements, including contracts with the National Football League ( NFL ) through fiscal 2012, contracts with the National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing ( NASCAR ) for certain races and exclusive rights for certain ancillary content through calendar year 2014, a contract with Major League Baseball ( MLB ) through calendar year 2013 and a contract for the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) through fiscal year 2010. These contracts provide the Company with the broadcast rights to certain national sporting events during their respective terms. The costs of these sports contracts are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period operating profit to estimated total operating profit for the remaining term of the contract. The profitability of these long-term national sports contracts is based on the Company best estimates at June 30, 2007 of directly attributable revenues and costs; such estimates may change in the future and such changes may be significant. Should revenues decline from estimates applied at June 30, 2007, a loss may be 46 Table of Contents recorded. Should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues, the Company may have an improved operating profit related to the contract, which may be recognized over the estimated remaining contract term. While the Company seeks to ensure compliance with federal indecency laws and related Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) regulations, the definition of indecency is subject to interpretation and there can be no assurance that the Company will not broadcast programming that is ultimately determined by the FCC to violate the prohibition against indecency. Such programming could subject the Company to regulatory review or investigation, fines, adverse publicity or other sanctions, including the loss of station licenses. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television The DBS segment operations consist of SKY Italia, which provides basic and premium programming services via satellite and broadband directly to subscribers in Italy. SKY Italia derives revenues principally from subscriber fees. The Company believes that the quality and variety of video, audio and interactive programming, quality of picture, access to service, customer service and price are the key elements for gaining and maintaining market share. SKY Italia competition includes companies that offer video, audio, interactive programming, telephony, data and other information and entertainment services, including broadband Internet providers, digital terrestrial transmission ( DTT ) services, wireless companies and companies that are developing new media technologies. In fiscal 2005, competitive DTT services in Italy expanded to include pay-per-view offering of soccer games previously available exclusively on the SKY Italia platform. The Company is currently prohibited from providing a pay DTT service under regulations of the European Commission. In addition, the Italian government previously offered a subsidy on the purchase of DTT decoders. SKY Italia most significant operating expenses are those related to the acquisition of entertainment, movie and sports programming and subscribers and the production and technical expenses related to operating the technical facilities. Operating expenses related to sports programming are generally recognized over the course of the related sport season, which may cause fluctuations in the operating results of this segment. Magazines and Inserts The Magazine and Inserts segment derives revenues from the sale of advertising space in free-standing inserts, in-store marketing products and services, promotional advertising, subscriptions and production fees. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues. Operating expenses for the Magazine and Inserts segment include paper costs, promotional, printing, retail commissions, distribution expenses and production costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. Newspapers The Newspapers segment derives revenues from the sale of advertising space and the sale of published newspapers. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues. Circulation revenues can be greatly affected by changes in competitors cover prices and by promotion activities. Operating expenses for the Newspapers segment include costs related to newsprint, ink, printing costs and editorial content. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. The Newspapers segment advertising volume, circulation and the price of newsprint are the key uncertainties whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the Company operating results and cash flow. The Company has to anticipate the level of advertising volume, circulation and newsprint prices in managing its businesses to maximize operating profit during expanding and contracting economic cycles. Newsprint is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. The Company costs and expenses are 47 Table of Contents affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of newsprint. The newspapers published by the Company compete for readership and advertising with local and national newspapers and also compete with television, radio, Internet and other media alternatives in their respective locales. Competition for newspaper circulation is based on the news and editorial content of the newspaper, service, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. The success of the newspapers published by the Company in competing with other newspapers and media for advertising depends upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. Competition for advertising among newspapers is based upon circulation levels, readership levels, reader demographics, advertising rates and advertiser results. Such judgments are based on factors such as cost, availability of alternative media, circulation and quality of readership demographics. In recent years, the newspaper industry has experienced difficulty increasing circulation volume and revenues. This is due to, among other factors, increased competition from new media formats and sources, and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news from sources other than a newspaper. The Company believes that competition from new media formats and sources and shifting consumer preferences will continue to pose challenges within the newspaper industry. Book Publishing The Book Publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general and children books in the United States and internationally. The revenues and operating results of the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of the Company releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. The book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end-of-year holiday season. Each book is a separate and distinct product, and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance. Major new title releases represent a significant portion of the Company sales throughout the fiscal year. Consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. Operating expenses for the Book Publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, authors royalties, editorial, art and design expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. The book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market and has been affected by consolidation trends. This market continues to change in response to technological innovations and other factors. Recent years have brought a number of significant mergers among the leading book publishers. There have also been a number of mergers completed in the distribution channel. The Company must compete with other publishers such as Random House, Penguin Group, Simon & Schuster and Hachette Livre, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities. Although the Company currently has strong positions in each of its book publishing markets, further consolidation in the industry could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage with respect to scale and resources.

( Google ), pursuant to which Google is the exclusive search and keyword-targeted advertising sales provider for a majority of FIM web properties. Under the terms of the agreement, Google is obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to FIM of $900 million, of which the $50 million that was due was paid as of June 30, 2007.

Under the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, Liberty will exchange its entire interest in the Company common stock (approximately 325 million shares of Class A Common Stock and 188 million shares of Class B Common Stock) for 100% of a News Corporation subsidiary ( Splitco ), whose holdings will consist of an approximately 39% interest (approximately 470 million shares) in The DIRECTV Group, Inc. ( DIRECTV ) constituting the Company entire interest in DIRECTV, three of the Company RSNs (FSN Northwest, FSN Pittsburgh and FSN Rocky Mountain (the Three RSNs )) and $588 million in cash, subject to adjustment. The transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement was approved by the Class B common stockholders on April 3, 2007, but remains subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, regulatory approvals, the receipt of a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and the absence of a material adverse effect on Splitco. If these conditions are satisfied, the transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of calendar 2007. The Company will enter into a non-competition agreement with DIRECTV and non-competition agreements with each of the Three RSNs, in each case, restricting its right to compete for a period of four years with DIRECTV and the Three RSNs in the respective regions in which such entities are operating on the date the Share Exchange Agreement is consummated. In January 2007, the Company and VeriSign, Inc. ( VeriSign ) formed a joint venture to provide entertainment content for mobile devices. The Company paid approximately $190 million for a controlling interest in VeriSign wholly-owned subsidiary, Jamba, which was combined with certain of the Company Fox Mobile Entertainment assets. The results of the joint venture have been included in the Company consolidated results of operations since January 2007. The Company and VeriSign have various call and put rights related to VeriSign ownership interest including VeriSign right to put its share of the joint venture to the Company for $150 million and $350 million, in fiscal 2010 and 2012, respectively. 49 Table of Contents In June 2007, the Company announced its plan to sell nine of its FOX-affiliated television stations. No agreement has yet been entered into with respect to the sale of any of these stations. In June 2007, the Company announced that it intends to explore strategic options for News Outdoor in connection with News Outdoor continued development plans.

See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation. Overview The Company revenues in fiscal 2007 increased 13% as compared to fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to revenue increases at the Cable Network Programming, Filmed Entertainment, DBS, Newspapers, Television and Other segments. Operating expenses for the fiscal year end June 30, 2007 increased 12% from fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher sports programming rights at the DBS, Cable Network Programming, Television and Other segments. The increase in operating expenses was also due to higher amortization of production and participation costs and higher home entertainment manufacturing and marketing expenses at the Filmed Entertainment segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increased personnel costs, higher costs relating to Internet activities 51 Table of Contents and incremental costs resulting from acquisitions. Depreciation and Amortization for fiscal 2007 increased 13% as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily resulting from acquisitions and additional plant and equipment placed into service. Operating income increased 15% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increased Operating income at the Cable Networks Programming, DBS, Newspapers and Filmed Entertainment segments. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the weakening of the U.S. dollar resulted in an increase of approximately 2% in both revenues and Operating income as compared to fiscal 2006. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 decreased $21 million as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from higher cash balances during the period. The increase in interest income was partially offset by increased interest expense primarily due to the issuance of $1,150 million in 6.4% Senior Notes due 2035 in December 2005 and $1,000 million in 6.15% Senior Notes due 2037 in March 2007. Equity earnings of affiliates Net earnings from equity affiliates increased $131 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 reflects increased contributions from DIRECTV, resulting from subscriber growth and higher pricing, as well as lower expenses resulting from DIRECTV set-top receiver lease program. These improvements were offset by the absence of equity earnings from Innova S. de R.L. de C.V. ( Innova ) sold in February 2006 and Sky Brasil Servicos Ltda ( Sky Brasil ) sold in August 2006 and increased costs at British Sky Broadcasting Group plc ( BSkyB ) associated with the launch of broadband.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation. Income tax expense The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was 34% as compared to the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 of 35% and a statutory rate of 35%. The lower effective rate for fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was due to the realization of deferred tax assets on which valuation allowances had previously been recorded and the resolution of domestic and foreign income tax matters. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the occurrence of certain capital gain transactions and ordinary taxable income resulted in the utilization of existing capital loss carryforwards and net operating losses on which valuation allowances had been previously recorded. Gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax During fiscal 2006, the Company sold its TSL Education Ltd. division ( TSL ), which primarily included The Times Educational Supplement publication in the United Kingdom, for cash consideration of approximately $395 million. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a gain of $381 million, net of tax of $0. Also in fiscal 2006, the Company sold Sky Radio Limited ( Sky Radio ), a commercial radio station group in the Netherlands and Germany, for cash consideration of approximately $215 million. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $134 million, net of tax of $0. Both of these transactions are included in gain on disposition of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. There was no provision for income taxes related to these transactions as any tax due was offset by a release of a valuation allowance that was applied to an existing deferred tax asset established for capital losses, which, because of the sale of TSL and Sky Radio, was utilized. Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) Topic No. D-108, Use of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other Than Goodwill ( EITF D-108 ). EITF D-108 requires companies who have applied the residual value method in the valuation of acquired identifiable intangibles for purchase accounting and impairment testing to use a direct value method. As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded a charge of $1.6 billion ($1 billion net of tax, or ($0.33) per diluted share of Class A Common Stock and ($0.28) per diluted share of Class B Common Stock), to reduce the intangible balances attributable to its television stations FCC licenses. This charge has been reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Net income Net income increased $1,112 million for fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the absence of the Cumulative effect of accounting change recognized in fiscal 2006 and increases in Operating income, Equity earnings from affiliates and Other, net. The increase in net income was partially offset by the effect of the gains on sale of TSL and Sky Radio that were recorded during fiscal 2006, with no corresponding gains in fiscal 2007. 53 Table of Contents Segment Analysis: The following table sets forth the Company revenues and operating income by segment, for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in worldwide home entertainment, pay television and free television revenues, partially offset by a decrease in worldwide theatrical revenues. The increase in home entertainment revenues for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the worldwide release of previously strong theatrical titles, primarily driven by Ice Age: The Meltdown, Night at the Museum, X-Men: The Last Stand, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan , The Devil Wears Prada and Eragon . Fiscal 2006 worldwide home entertainment releases included Fantastic Four, Walk the Line, Robots, Kingdom of Heaven and Hide & Seek . Home entertainment revenues generated from the sale and distribution of film and television titles in fiscal 2007 were 78% and 22%, respectively, of total home entertainment revenues. The increases in worldwide pay television and free television revenues were primarily due to a stronger film lineup and more feature films available during fiscal 2007 and stronger revenues from the returning primetime series Prison Break, Family Guy and My Name Is Earl . Fiscal 2007 worldwide theatrical revenues were driven by the worldwide release of Night at the Museum, Eragon, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, The Devil Wears Prada and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer . Fiscal 2006 theatrical releases included Ice Age: The Meltdown, X-Men: The Last Stand, Fantastic Four, Walk the Line, Big Momma House 2 and Cheaper by the Dozen 2 . 54 Table of Contents Operating income at the Filmed Entertainment segment for the fiscal year ended 2007 increased $133 million, or 12%, as compared to fiscal 2006. The improvement was primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, which were partially offset by higher releasing costs and higher amortization of production and participation costs directly associated with the increase in revenues noted above. Television (20% and 21% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, Television segment revenues increased $371 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2006. The Television segment reported a decrease in Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 of $70 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2006. Revenues at the U.S. television operations increased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to the broadcasts of the BCS and NASCAR Daytona 500 with no comparable events in fiscal 2006 and higher FOX prime-time advertising revenue due to higher pricing and additional commercial inventory sold. Also contributing to the increased advertising revenues was higher political advertising at the Company television stations due to the November 2006 elections. The increase in revenue was partially offset by revenue decreases at the Company-owned MyNetworkTV affiliated stations. Operating income at the Company U.S. television operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 decreased from fiscal 2006. The decrease in Operating income was a result of expenses associated with the first full year of MyNetworkTV which was launched in September 2006, higher sports programming costs related to the BCS, Daytona 500 and the new NFL contracts, partially offset by the increase in revenues noted above. Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 at the Company international television operations increased over fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher advertising revenues in India and higher subscription revenues. Operating income for the Company international television operations decreased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher programming costs. Cable Network Programming (13% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased $544 million, or 16%, as compared to fiscal 2006. The increase was driven by higher net affiliate and advertising revenues at the RSNs and FIC, as well as increased net affiliate revenues at Fox News and FX. The RSNs revenues increased 12% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to advertising and net affiliate revenue increases. The increase in advertising revenues was primarily due to additional revenues from the increased number of MLB and National Basketball Association ( NBA ) games broadcasted. The increase in net affiliate revenues was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber and a higher number of subscribers, including those from the acquisition of SportSouth in May 2006. Fox News revenues increased 19% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to net affiliate and advertising revenue increases. Net affiliate revenues increased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as a result of increases in average rates per subscriber and lower cable distribution amortization as compared to fiscal 2006. Advertising revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 increased as compared to fiscal 2006 due to higher pricing and higher volume. In addition, revenue from licensing fees contributed to the increase in fiscal 2007. As of June 30, 2007, Fox News reached approximately 92 million Nielsen households. FX revenues increased 4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in net affiliate revenues. Net affiliate revenues increased as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in the average rate per subscriber and in the number of subscribers. As of June 30, 2007, FX reached approximately 92 million Nielsen households. 55 Table of Contents Revenues at the Company international cable channels increased 65% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The increases were due to the consolidation of NGC Network International LLC ( NGC International ) and NGC Network Latin America LLC ( NGC Latin America ) beginning January 1, 2007, as well as improved advertising sales and subscriber growth at the other FIC channels. The Cable Network Programming segment Operating income increased $226 million, or 26%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006. This improvement in Operating income was primarily driven by the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher sports rights amortization mainly due to additional games, higher entertainment programming for new shows and incremental expenses from the consolidation of NGC International and NGC Latin America. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television (11% and 10% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, SKY Italia revenues increased $534 million, or 21%, as compared to fiscal 2006. This revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscribers over fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, SKY Italia added approximately 368,000 net subscribers, which resulted in SKY Italia subscriber base totaling almost 4.2 million at June 30, 2007. The total churn for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was approximately 423,000 on an average subscriber base of approximately 4.0 million, as compared to churn of approximately 314,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of approximately 3.6 million in fiscal 2006. Subscriber churn for the period represents the number of SKY Italia subscribers whose service was disconnected during the period. SKY Italia average revenue per subscriber ( ARPU ) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was approximately 44 and was consistent with that of fiscal 2006. SKY Italia calculates ARPU by dividing total subscriber-related revenues for the period by the average subscribers for the period and dividing that amount by the number of months in the period. Subscriber-related revenues are comprised of total subscription revenue, pay-per-view revenue and equipment rental revenue for the period. Average subscribers are calculated for the respective periods by adding the beginning and ending subscribers for the period and dividing by two. Subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber ( SAC ) were approximately 260 in fiscal 2007, which was consistent with that of fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in commissions being offset by lower average installation costs. SAC is calculated by dividing total subscriber acquisition costs for a period by the number of gross SKY Italia subscribers during the period. Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of the commissions paid to retailers and other distributors, the cost of equipment sold directly by SKY Italia to subscribers and the costs related to installation and acquisition advertising, net of any upfront activation fee. SKY Italia excludes the value of equipment capitalized under SKY Italia equipment lease program, as well as payments and the value of returned equipment related to disconnected lease program subscribers from subscriber acquisition costs. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, Operating income at SKY Italia improved by $182 million as compared to fiscal 2006. The improvement in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher programming costs due to the increased subscriber base, as well as higher sports rights amortization. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the weakening of the U.S. dollar resulted in an increase of approximately 7% in both revenues and Operating income as compared to fiscal 2006. Magazines and Inserts (4% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, revenues at the Magazines and Inserts segment increased $29 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in revenues primarily resulted from an increase in volume of in-store marketing and free-standing insert products, partially offset by lower rates for these products. 56 Table of Contents Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 increased $28 million, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, as well as lower printing costs. Newspapers (16% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2007 and 2006) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, revenues at the Newspaper segment increased $391 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal 2006. Operating income increased $136 million, or 26%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The weakening of the U.S. dollar resulted in increases of approximately 7% in both revenues and Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, U.K. newspapers revenues increased 9% as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange movements and higher Internet revenues which were partially offset by lower circulation and advertising revenues. Operating income increased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to a higher redundancy provision in fiscal 2006. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the Company recorded a redundancy provision of approximately $109 million as compared with a $24 million provision recorded during fiscal 2007. The increase in Operating income was also a result of lower production costs due to decreased circulation and lower promotional costs, partially offset by higher operating costs associated with the launch of a free London newspaper, increased investment in Internet businesses and higher newsprint costs. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, Australian newspapers revenues increased 10% as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange movements, an increase in advertising revenues and incremental revenue from the acquisition of the Federal Publishing Company group of companies in April 2007. Operating income increased 3% as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the impact of favorable exchange rate movements, partially offset by higher employee and newsprint costs. Book Publishing ( 5% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2007 and 2006) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, revenues at the Book Publishing segment increased by $35 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong sales on key titles, including The Dangerous Book For Boys by Conn and Hal Iggulden, The Reagan Diaries by Ronald Reagan, The Children of Hurin by J.R.R. Tolkien and The Measure of a Man by Sidney Poitier, partially offset by lower revenues from the successful children title The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis in the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, HarperCollins had 128 titles on The New York Times Bestseller lists with 16 titles reaching the number one position. Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 decreased $8 million, or 5%, as compared to fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of the highly profitable The Chronicles of Narnia which were included in fiscal 2006. Other ( 8% and 6% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, revenues at the Other operating segment increased $889 million, or 64%, as compared to fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of active users and higher advertising revenues from FIM Internet sites. The revenue increase was also driven by incremental revenues from acquisitions by FIM in October 2005 and from the Jamba joint venture which was formed in January 2007. Also contributing to the revenue increase was Global Cricket Corporation sale of the broadcast and sponsorship rights of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) Cricket World Cup with no comparable event in fiscal 2006. 57 Table of Contents Operating results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, decreased $43 million as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to a loss on the ICC Cricket World Cup which can be attributable to a shortfall in advertising and sponsorship revenue. This underperformance was due to the early elimination of two of the more popular teams from the competition, which resulted in matches among less well-known teams, significantly reducing the Company advertising and sponsorship revenues. Also contributing to the decrease was higher employee costs and higher costs related to Internet initiatives. The decrease in operating results was partially offset by improved Operating income at FIM, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above.

See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation. Overview The Company revenues in fiscal 2006 increased 6% as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to revenue increases at the Cable Network Programming, Filmed Entertainment, DBS and Other segments. Operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased approximately 4% from fiscal 2005, primarily due to increased expenses at the Cable Network Programming segment and acquisitions made by the Newspaper segment and FIM during fiscal 2005 and 2006. The increased operating expenses at the Cable 58 Table of Contents Network Programming segment were due to the acquisition in April 2005 of the Florida and Ohio RSNs and Fox Sports Net, a national sports program service, and higher programming costs at the remaining RSNs and the FX. In addition, operating results include the consolidation of Queensland Press Pty Ltd ( QPL ), which was acquired in November 2004, within the Newspapers segment and the impact of the Internet businesses acquired by the Company in fiscal 2006, collectively referred to as the FIM acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by reduced operating expenses at the Filmed Entertainment and Television segments. The operating expense reduction at the Filmed Entertainment segment was due to reduced amortization of production and participation costs. The decrease in operating expenses at the Television segment was mainly due to the absence of programming costs for the NFL Super Bowl and NASCAR Daytona 500 that were broadcast in fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 from fiscal 2005, primarily due to the consolidation of the Florida and Ohio RSNs, Fox Sports Net and QPL. In addition, the impact of acquisitions at FIM also contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 20% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, when compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired on the purchase of the minority interest in the FEG in March 2005, as well as incremental expenses resulting from the FIM acquisitions. Accelerated depreciation recognized on printing plant assets in the United Kingdom also contributed to the increase. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, Operating income increased 9% from fiscal 2005, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above. The Operating income increase was offset by a $109 million redundancy provision recorded as an other operating charge during fiscal 2006. The redundancy provision, recorded at the Newspapers segment, was related to certain U.K. employees as a result of the Company committing to a reduction in workforce, associated with the development of new printing plants in the United Kingdom. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net increased $9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase is primarily due to interest on the Company issuance of $1.0 billion in 6.2% Senior Notes due 2034 and $750 million in 5.3% Senior Notes due 2014 in December 2004 and $1.15 billion in 6.4% Senior Notes due 2035 in December 2005. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by higher interest income. Equity earnings of affiliates Net earnings from affiliates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased $533 million as compared to fiscal 2005. The improvement for fiscal 2006 was due to an increased contribution from DIRECTV on subscriber growth and increased pricing. DIRECTV results also reflect lower expenses associated with a new set-top receiver lease program, as well as the absence of charges recognized in fiscal 2005 related to the SPACEWAY program and PanAmSat. For the years ended June 30, 2006 2005 Change % Change ( $ millions) The Company share of equity earnings of affiliates principally consists of: British Sky Broadcasting Group plc $ 369 $ 374 $ (5 ) (1 )% The DIRECTV Group, Inc. 246 (186 ) 432 * * Other DBS equity affiliates 108 81 27 33 % Cable channel equity affiliates 68 46 22 48 % Other equity affiliates 97 40 57 * * Total equity earnings of affiliates $ 888 $ 355 $ 533 * * ** not meaningful 59 Table of Contents Other, net For the years ended June 30, 2006 2005 (in millions) Loss on sale of Regional Programming Partners (a) $ $ (85 ) Gain on sale of Innova (b) 206 Gain on sale of China Netcom Group Corporation (b) 52 Loss on sale of Sky Multi-Country Partners (b) (55 ) Gain on sale of Rogers Sportsnet (b) 39 Change in fair value of exchangeable securities (c) (76 ) 246 Other 12 33 Total Other, net $ 194 $ 178 (a) See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation.

A significant variance in the price of the underlying stock could have a material impact on the operating results of the Company. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation. Income tax expense The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was 35%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 reflects the positive impact of the Company application of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( AJCA ). The Company reflected a tax benefit of approximately $126 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, primarily resulting from the reduction of prior deferred tax accruals relating to the repatriation of foreign earnings at the lower rate of 5.25% under the AJCA. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was slightly higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 of 34%, primarily due to the impact of the resolution of foreign income tax audits in fiscal 2005, offset by the impact of the AJCA noted above. Minority interest in subsidiaries, net of tax Minority interest expense improved by $146 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of minority shares of FEG in fiscal 2005. Gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax In October 2005, the Company sold TSL for cash consideration of approximately $395 million and recorded a gain on disposition of discontinued operations of approximately $381 million. In April 2006, the Company sold Sky Radio for cash consideration of approximately $215 million and recorded a gain on disposition of discontinued operations of approximately $134 million. (See Results of Operations Fiscal 2007 versus Fiscal 2006 for further information on Gain on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax) Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted EITF D-108. As a result of this adoption, the Company recorded a charge of $1.6 billion ($1 billion net of tax) to reduce the intangible balances attributable to its television stations FCC licenses. (See Results of Operations Fiscal 2007 versus Fiscal 2006 for further information on Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax) Net income Net income increased $186 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in Operating income, Equity earnings from affiliates, Other income, the Gain on the disposition of discontinued operations, as well as lower minority interest expense, partially offset by the Cumulative effect of accounting change. 60 Table of Contents Segment Analysis: The following table sets forth the Company revenues and operating income by segment, for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in worldwide theatrical, pay television and free television revenues, partially offset by a decrease in worldwide home entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues increased primarily due to improved performance and an increase in the number of releases, driven by successful titles including Ice Age: The Meltdown, X-Men: The Last Stand, Fantastic Four, Walk the Line, Big Momma House 2 and Cheaper by the Dozen 2. Fiscal 2005 theatrical releases included I, Robot, Alien vs. Predator, Robots, Hide & Seek and Sideways. The increases in worldwide pay television and free television revenues were primarily due to a stronger film lineup, more feature films available during fiscal 2006 and stronger revenues from the returning primetime series 24 and new primetime series Prison Break and My Name Is Earl . Fiscal 2006 worldwide home entertainment revenues were driven by the worldwide release of Fantastic Four, Walk the Line, Robots, Kingdom of Heaven and Hide & Seek. Fiscal 2005 included the worldwide home entertainment release of The Day After Tomorrow, I, Robot, Alien vs. Predator, Garfield, Dodgeball, Man on Fire, Napoleon Dynamite, the Star Wars Trilogy and the distribution fees earned for The Passion of the Christ . The film home entertainment decreases were slightly offset by home entertainment revenue from television titles, including Family Guy and 24. Home entertainment revenues generated from the sale and distribution of film and television titles in fiscal 2006 were 76% and 24%, respectively, of total home entertainment revenues. Operating income at the Filmed Entertainment segment for fiscal 2006 increased $34 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2005. This improvement was due to the revenue changes noted above and lower home 61 Table of Contents entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher theatrical marketing costs directly associated with the increased number of releases. Television (21% and 22% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, Television segment revenue was consistent with fiscal 2005. The Television segment reported an increase in Operating income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 of $80 million, or 8%, from fiscal 2005. Revenues at the Company U.S. television operations decreased 1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to the broadcast of the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 in fiscal 2005, with no comparable events in fiscal 2006. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in primetime net advertising revenue as a result of higher primetime ratings, pricing and continued growth in local news programming versus fiscal 2005. Operating income at the Company U.S. television operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased approximately 11% from fiscal 2005. The increase was mainly due to the absence of programming costs for the Super Bowl and Daytona 500 that were broadcast in fiscal 2005, partially offset by the decreased revenues noted above and by higher programming costs for returning shows, local news expansions, music license fees and new sports programming on the non-FOX affiliated stations. Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 at the Company international television operations increased over fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily driven by higher advertising and subscription revenues.

These increases were driven by higher net affiliate and advertising revenues at the RSNs and FX, as well as increased advertising revenue at Fox News. FX revenues increased 14% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to advertising and net affiliate revenue increases.

The RSNs revenues increased 30% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to advertising and net affiliate revenue increases. The increase in advertising revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of the Florida and Ohio RSNs in April 2005. Also contributing to the increase in advertising revenues was the resumption of NHL games in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 after the cancellation of the 2004-05 NHL season. In addition, there was an increase in overall advertising pricing in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Net affiliate revenues increased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to the consolidation of the Florida and Ohio RSNs, the absence of fiscal 2005 allowances related to the cancellation of the 2004-05 NHL season, an increase in DBS subscribers and higher average rates per subscriber. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, Fox News revenues increased 13% as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to advertising and affiliate revenue increases. Advertising revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased as compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher pricing and higher volume.

The Cable Network Programming segment Operating income increased $162 million, or 23%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily driven by the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher programming expenses. Programming expenses increased primarily due to the consolidation of the Florida and Ohio RSNs and Fox Sports Net in April 2005 and the programming costs associated with the resumption of NHL games after the cancellation of the 2004-05 season. Also contributing to this increase were newly acquired series and more original programming at FX. In addition, marketing expenses increased at FX due to increased promotion costs for its new original series, as well as returning shows in fiscal 2006. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television (10% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005 ) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, SKY Italia revenues increased $229 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal 2005. This revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscribers over fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, SKY Italia added approximately 513,000 net subscribers, which resulted in SKY Italia subscriber base totaling more than 3.8 million at June 30, 2006. The total churn for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was approximately 314,000 on an average subscriber base of 3.6 million, as compared to churn of approximately 270,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 3.0 million in fiscal 2005. Subscriber churn for the period represents the number of SKY Italia subscribers whose service was disconnected during the period. ARPU for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was over 44. The ARPU for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 improved slightly over fiscal 2005 primarily due to a nearly 2 price increase during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, which was partially offset by price promotions. SAC of approximately 260 in fiscal 2006 increased over fiscal 2005 due to changes in the consumer offer that reflected lower upfront activation fees and increased advertising and marketing costs on a per gross addition basis, although fiscal 2006 marketing and advertising costs on an aggregate basis remained relatively flat as compared to fiscal 2005. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in decreases of approximately 4% in both revenues and operating income as compared to fiscal 2005. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, operating results at SKY Italia improved by $212 million as compared to fiscal 2005. The improvement was primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by increased programming costs associated with the larger subscriber base, as well as higher spending, which was primarily due to the broadcast of additional movie titles and new entertainment channels on the basic programming tier.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the U.K. newspapers revenues decreased 7% as compared to fiscal 2005. The U.K. newspapers advertising revenues decreased from fiscal 2005 as a result of a general weakness in the U.K. advertising market. Advertising revenues were affected by lower mono display and lower classified revenues across all titles. Revenues also decreased due to the absence of revenue from TSL, which the Company sold in October 2005. The decrease was partially offset by higher color display revenue on The Sun , The Times and The Sunday Times and increased circulation revenues due to cover price increases across all titles and higher net circulation on The Times as a result of promotional activities and strong editorial content. U.K. newspapers Operating income decreased 70% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

In addition, higher depreciation expense and other costs associated with the development of the new printing plants in the United Kingdom also contributed to this decrease. The Company expects annualized personnel cost savings of approximately $65 million when the U.K. workforce reduction is completed. Also contributing to this decrease in operating income was the lower advertising revenue noted above, the absence of the TSL division noted above, increased costs associated with employees and increased newsprint costs. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the Australian newspapers revenues increased 9% as compared to fiscal 2005, mainly due to the consolidation of the results of QPL beginning in November 2004. Also contributing to this increase were improved display and classified advertising revenues, along with the impact of cover price increases at the major weekend newspapers. The increase in Operating income of 8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, was primarily attributable to the consolidation of QPL beginning in November 2004. Book Publishing (5% and 6% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, revenues at the Book Publishing segment decreased by $15 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2005 as fiscal 2005 included the effect of significant sales of The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, HarperCollins had 109 titles on The New York Times Bestseller List with 14 titles reaching the number one position. Notable bestsellers during fiscal 2006 included: Marley and Me by John Grogan, Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren, YOU: The Owner Manual by Michael F. Roizen and Mehmet C. Oz, M.D. and The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis. Operating income for the Book Publishing segment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 increased by $3 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2005.

Other (6% and 5% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, revenues at the Other segment increased $274 million, or 24%, as compared to fiscal 2005.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Current Financial Condition The Company principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds; however, the Company has access to the worldwide capital markets, a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and various film co-production alternatives to supplement its cash flows. The availability under the revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2007 was reduced by letters of credit issued which totaled approximately $121 million. Also, as of June 30, 2007, the Company had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.7 billion. The Company believes that cash flows from operations will be adequate for the Company to conduct its operations. The Company internally generated funds are highly dependent upon the state of the advertising market and public acceptance of film and television products. Any significant decline in the advertising market or the performance of the Company films could adversely impact its cash flows from operations which could require the Company to seek other sources of funds including proceeds from the sale of certain assets or other alternative sources. The principal uses of cash that affect the Company liquidity position include the following: investments in the production and distribution of new feature films and television programs; the acquisition of and payments under programming rights for entertainment and sports programming; paper purchases; operational expenditures including employee costs; capital expenditures; interest expense; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; dividends; acquisitions and stock repurchases.

The higher sports rights payments reflect the renewal of several sports teams local rights agreements, the addition of the BCS sports rights and higher international sports rights. Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 is as follows (in millions): Years Ended June 30, 2007 2006 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,076 ) $ (2,060 ) Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2007 was slightly higher than fiscal 2006 due to higher capital expenditures and increased investments. Partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in the total net cash used for acquisitions and dispositions. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the Company continued investment in new printing plants in the United Kingdom and an increase in expenditures related to Internet initiatives. The decrease in cash used for acquisitions was primarily due to the acquisitions of Intermix Media, Inc. ( Intermix ) and IGN Entertainment, Inc. ( IGN ) during fiscal 2006. 65 Table of Contents The Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the Company securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness.

The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Intermix, IGN and a RSN during fiscal 2006. The cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2006 was partially offset by proceeds received from the disposition of discontinued operations as the Company sold its TSL division for approximately $395 million in cash consideration in October 2005 and its Sky Radio division for approximately $215 million in cash consideration in April 2006. The cash received from the sale of Innova and China Netcom Group Corporation 66 Table of Contents during fiscal 2006 and cash received in advance on the sale of Sky Brasil to DIRECTV and the sale of other non-strategic investments during fiscal 2005 also partially offset the cash used in investing activities.

The Company would be liable under this guarantee, to the extent of default by the affiliate. As of June 30, 2007, the Company was contractually obligated for approximately $242 million and $42 million in the United Kingdom and Australia, respectively, for new printing plants and related costs. All firm commitments related to these projects are included in the capital expenditure lines disclosed in the commitments table above. The table excludes the Company pension and other postretirement benefits ( OPEB ) obligations. The Company made voluntary contributions of $67 million and $149 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates. Assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the Company expected plan return of 7% in fiscal 2008 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any material contributions to its pension plans to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements for the foreseeable future. The Company expects to make voluntary contributions of approximately $60 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2008. Payments due to participants under the Company pension plans are primarily paid out of the underlying trusts. Payments due under the Company OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the Company pension plans. The Company expects its OPEB payments to approximate $7 million in fiscal 2008. See Note 16 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation for further discussion of the Company pension and OPEB plans. Contingencies The Company wholly-owned subsidiary, News Outdoor owns and operates outdoor advertising companies and also owns approximately 73% of Media Support Services Limited ( MSS ), an outdoor advertising company 71 Table of Contents in Russia. The minority stockholders of MSS had the right to sell a portion of their interests to News Outdoor during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and exercised those rights. In certain limited circumstances, the minority stockholders of MSS have the right to sell, and News Outdoor has the right to purchase, the remaining minority interests at fair market value. The Company believes that the exercise of these sale rights, if any, will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. In June 2007, the Company announced that it intends to explore strategic options for News Outdoor in connection with News Outdoor continued development plans. These strategic options include, but are not limited to, exploring the opportunity to expand News Outdoor existing shareholder group through new strategic and private equity partners. Other than previously disclosed in the notes to these consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to several purchase and sale arrangements which become exercisable over the next ten years by the Company or the counter-party to the agreement. In the next twelve months, none of these arrangements that become exercisable are material. Purchase arrangements that are exercisable by the counter-party to the agreement, and that are outside the sole control of the Company are accounted for in accordance with EITF No. D-98 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities . Accordingly, the fair values of such purchase arrangements are classified in Minority interest liabilities. The Company experiences routine litigation in the normal course of its business. The Company believes that none of its pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. The Company operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and as a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. Related Party Transactions Immediately prior to and as part of the Reorganization, the Company acquired from certain trusts, the beneficiaries of which include Mr. K.R. Murdoch, members of his family and certain charities ( the Murdoch Trusts ), the 58% shareholding in QPL which was not already owned by the Company predecessor through the acquisition of the Cruden Group of companies ( the Cruden/QPL Transaction ). The principal assets of the Cruden Group were shares of News Corporation and a 58% interest in QPL. QPL owns a publishing business which includes two metropolitan and eight regional newspapers in Queensland, Australia, as well as shares in News Corporation. Following this transaction, Mr. K.R. Murdoch and the Murdoch Trusts owned approximately 29.5% of the Company Class B Common Stock. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the Company financial condition and results, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the Company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board. For a summary of all of the Company significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management best 72 Table of Contents knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from the estimates. Revenue Recognition Filmed Entertainment Revenues from distribution of feature films are recognized in accordance with SOP 00-2. Revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized as they are exhibited and revenues from home video and DVD sales, net of a reserve for estimated returns, together with related costs, are recognized on the date that video and DVD units are made widely available for sale by retailers and all Company-imposed restrictions on the sale of video and DVD units have expired. Revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television program is made available to the licensee for broadcast. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on the historical performance of similar films, incorporating factors such as the past box office record of the lead actors and actresses, the genre of the film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings) and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. Management updates such estimates based on information available on the actual results of each film through its life cycle. License agreements for the telecast of theatrical and television product in the broadcast network, syndicated television and cable television markets are routinely entered into in advance of their available date for telecast. Cash received and amounts billed in connection with such contractual rights for which revenue is not yet recognizable is classified as deferred revenue. Because deferred revenue generally relates to contracts for the licensing of theatrical and television product which have already been produced, the recognition of revenue for such completed product is principally only dependent upon the commencement of the availability period for telecast under the terms of the related licensing agreement. Television, Cable Network Programming and Direct Broadcast Satellite Advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired, net of agency commissions. Subscriber fees received from subscribers, cable systems and DBS operators are recognized as revenue in the period that services are provided, net of amortization of cable distribution investments. The Company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Filmed Entertainment and Television Programming Costs Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with SOP 00-2, which requires management judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period. These judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized filmed entertainment and television programming costs, the expensing of participation and residual costs associated with revenues earned and any fair value adjustments. In accordance with SOP 00-2, the Company amortizes filmed entertainment and television programming costs using the individual-film-forecast method. Under the individual-film-forecast method, such programming costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that current period actual revenue for such title bears to management estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the current fiscal year to be recognized over approximately a six year period or operating profits to be realized from all media and markets for such title. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on factors such as historical performance of similar films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses and once released actual results of each film. For each television program, management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue on the performance of the television programming in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell additional episodes of the program and the past performance of similar television programs. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a title-by-title basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write down of the asset to fair value. 73 Table of Contents The costs of national sports contracts at FOX and for international sports rights agreements are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period operating profit to estimated total remaining operating profit of the contract. Estimates of total operating profit can change and accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary. Such changes in the future could be material. The costs of local and regional sports contracts, which are for a specified number of events, are amortized on an event-by-event basis. Those costs, which are for a specified season, are amortized over the season on a straight-line basis, and if applicable, a portion of the cost is allocated to rebroadcasts. Original cable programming is amortized on an accelerated basis. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a contract basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write down of the asset to fair value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to the Company business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the Company estimates. In those cases where the Company determines that the useful life of buildings and equipment should be shortened, the Company would depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense. Intangible Assets The Company has a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, FCC licenses, and other copyright products and trademarks. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair market value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. Identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill thereto requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. Carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . The Company impairment review is based on, among other methods, a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of the cash flows for that reporting unit. An impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired. 74 Table of Contents For all of its television station acquisitions through June 30, 2005, the Company utilized the residual method to estimate the fair value of the stations FCC licenses. Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted EITF D-108. EITF D-108 requires companies who have applied the residual value method in the valuation of acquired identifiable intangibles for purchase accounting and impairment testing to now use a direct valuation method. The direct valuation method used for FCC licenses requires, among other inputs, the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the Company owns television stations. This method also involves the use of management judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the U.S. broadcast industry. The resulting fair values for FCC licenses are sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material. Income Taxes The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company annual provision for income taxes and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on evaluations of the probability of whether additional taxes and related interest and penalties will be due. The Company adjusts these reserves based on changing facts and circumstances and it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter. The Company believes that its reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax matters. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. Employee Costs In June 2007, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) ( SFAS No. 158 ). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the fiscal year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation) The following table summarizes the incremental effects of the initial adoption of SFAS No. 158 on the Company consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2007: Before application of SFAS No.158 SFAS No. 158 adjustment After application of SFAS No. 158 (in millions) Intangible assets $ 11,710 $ (7 ) $ 11,703 Other non-current assets 1,096 (274 ) 822 Total assets 62,624 (281 ) 62,343 Other liabilities 3,301 18 3,319 Deferred income taxes 5,999 (100 ) 5,899 Total stockholders equity 33,121 (199 ) 32,922 Total liabilities and stockholders equity 62,624 (281 ) 62,343 75 Table of Contents The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of its employees and retirees. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense (income) is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considered the pension portfolio past average rate of returns, and future return expectations of the various asset classes. The expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% equities, 37% fixed-income securities and 3% in all other investments. The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the Company annual measurement date of June 30 and is subject to change each year. The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The rate was determined based on a cash flow matching technique whereby a hypothetical portfolio of high quality debt securities was constructed that mirrors the specific benefit obligations for each of the Company primary plans where appropriate. The key assumptions used in developing the Company fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 net periodic pension expense (income) for its plans consists of the following: 2007 2006 2005 ($ in millions) Discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost 5.9 % 5.1 % 5.7 % Assets: Expected rate of return 7.0 % 7.5 % 7.5 % Expected return $ 135 $ 122 $ 111 Actual return $ 232 $ 186 $ 160 Gain $ 97 $ 64 $ 49 One year actual return 12.3 % 11.1 % 10.8 % Five year actual return 9.0 % 4.7 % 1.7 % The weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia as of the measurement date. The Company will utilize a weighted average discount rate of 6.0% in calculating the fiscal 2008 net periodic pension expense for its plans. The Company will continue to use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 7% for fiscal 2008 based principally on a combination of asset mix and historical experience of actual plan returns. The net losses on the Company pension plans were $301 million at June 30, 2007, a decrease from $348 million at June 30, 2006. This decrease of $47 million was due primarily to an actual plan asset return of 12% in fiscal 2007, which was higher than the expected rate of return of 7%, and loss amortization in fiscal 2007. The net losses at June 30, 2006 were primarily a result of economic conditions and the strengthening of the mortality assumptions. Economic conditions impacting the plan were the lower interest rate environment for high-quality fixed income debt instruments over the past five years and the downturn in the equity markets in the earlier part of this decade. These deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions ( SFAS No. 87 ). Unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants. The Company made contributions of $67 million, $149 million and $236 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These were primarily voluntary contributions made to improve the funded status of the plans which were impacted by a declining interest rate environment, as well as the downturn of the equity markets earlier in this decade. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rate movements. Assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the Company 76 Table of Contents expected plan returns in fiscal 2008 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any statutory contributions to its primary U.S. pension plans for the foreseeable future. Changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the Company expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table highlights the sensitivity of the Company pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant: Changes in Assumption Impact on Annual Pension Expense Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Increase $12 million Increase $87 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Decrease $12 million Decrease $87 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $6 million 0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $6 million Net periodic pension expense for the Company pension plans is expected to be approximately $80 million in fiscal 2008 which is consistent with fiscal 2007.
