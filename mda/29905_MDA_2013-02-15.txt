ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended December 31, 2012 . The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I of this Form 10-K. OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK Dover is a diversified global manufacturer focusing on innovative equipment and components, specialty systems, and support services provided through its four major operating segments: Communication Technologies, Energy, Engineered Systems, and Printing & Identification. The Company's entrepreneurial business model encourages, promotes, and fosters deep customer engagement which has led to Dover's well-established and valued reputation for providing superior customer service and industry-leading product innovation. Overall, 2012 concluded as a solid performance year, with strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth, despite the backdrop of a low-growth macro-economic environment. Our consolidated revenue increased $735 million or 10% to $8.1 billion, inclusive of acquisitions, and our gross profit increased by $262 million or 9% to $3.1 billion. The 2012 results were led by our strong positions in the energy, handset, refrigeration and food equipment, and other industrial markets. In our Energy segment, expanding production activity and strong downstream investments in distribution and retail fueling are among the trends that drove solid results during the year. The strong production and downstream performance was partially offset by the softening North American rig count, which caused our year-over-year drilling end market comparisons to decline as the year progressed. In all, the segment had solid performance, characterized by continuing growth and strong margins. We expect this trend to continue in 2013. Within our Communication Technologies segment, several OEM's launched new products in the handset market during the second quarter and our microelectronic mechanical ("MEMs") microphone activity was very strong once the new OEM product launches commenced. However, our 2012 performance at Sound Solutions was weaker than anticipated. The Sound Solutions business continued to work through operational challenges which led to lower volumes than anticipated for the year; however, they did experience sequential growth and margin improvement in the fourth quarter, relative to the earlier quarters, and we expect their performance to continue to improve in 2013. Overall, we expect the handset market to be strong in 2013, supported by numerous new product releases, coupled with the increased use of multiple microphones per handset. Our aerospace/defense and medical technology markets were solid during the year, while our telecom market continued to be weak. Within our Engineered Systems segment, the refrigeration and food equipment markets were solid, as were most of our U.S. industrial end markets. The results of our Fluid Solutions platform continued to reflect good performance from our first quarter Maag Pump Systems acquisition, which helped to mitigate the impact of a weakened market in Europe. We expect 2013 to be another solid year for Engineered Systems, as we leverage our recent acquisitions and continue our geographic expansion within our Fluid Solutions platform. We anticipate customer wins, an active remodel market, expanded product offerings and recent acquisitions to drive 2013 growth within our Refrigeration & Industrial platform. In our Printing & Identification segment, solid organic growth in our fast moving consumer goods market more than offset uneven demand in our industrial markets, which was impacted by weak Europe and slowing China markets. We anticipate the release of several new products in the first half of the year, traction of added sales and service resources in key regional markets, along with stable fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets to contribute to our 2013 growth. Margin performance in the segment steadily improved over the course of 2012, driven by productivity and restructuring activities. We expect incremental benefit from these activities to carry over into 2013, enabling continued reinvestment in our product identification growth space. 24 Table of Contents In addition to our solid financial results, we continued to execute on our corporate strategy. During 2012, we continued to focus on our five key growth spaces of communication components, energy, fluids, refrigeration and food equipment, and product identification. We invested $1.2 billion on seven acquisitions that expanded our markets, enhanced our product offerings and broadened our customer base. In advancing our strategy of focusing on our higher margin growth spaces, we have reclassified to discontinued operations two non-core businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets. We expect to divest these businesses in 2013. Although solid performers, these businesses serve highly volatile end-markets, and their sale should improve the consistency of our future results and enable management to focus on our key growth spaces. In 2012, we generated $964 million in free cash flow, which enabled us to continue to invest in higher growth economies and innovation, and to continue our long tradition of raising our annual dividend, now standing at 57 consecutive years. Lastly, in November of 2012, we announced and began to execute on a $1 billion share repurchase program, to continue to drive long-term shareholder value. With respect to our expectations for 2013, we are targeting full year organic growth in the range of 3% to 5% (inclusive of a negligible foreign exchange impact) and acquisition related growth of approximately 4% for acquisitions completed in 2012. Based on these revenue assumptions, our profitability expectations and anticipated additional share buy-backs, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2013 is estimated to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.35, and we expect our earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters. If global or domestic economic conditions accelerate or deteriorate, our operating results for 2013 could be materially different than currently projected. 25 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in the fourth quarter of 2012 , we reclassified certain businesses in the Printing & Identification segment to discontinued operations based on our decision to divest these businesses. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations and are presented within results of discontinued operations for all periods presented. Years Ended December 31, % / Point Change (dollars in thousands, except per share figures) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Revenue $ 8,104,339 $ 7,369,154 $ 6,109,507 10.0 % 20.6 % Cost of goods and services 4,997,274 4,524,351 3,686,861 10.5 % 22.7 % Gross profit 3,107,065 2,844,803 2,422,646 9.2 % 17.4 % Gross profit margin 38.3 % 38.6 % 39.7 % (0.3 ) (1.1 ) Selling and administrative expenses 1,841,688 1,720,954 1,499,597 7.0 % 14.8 % Selling and administrative as a percent of revenue 22.7 % 23.4 % 24.5 % (0.7 ) (1.1 ) Interest expense, net 121,141 115,525 106,371 4.9 % 8.6 % Other expense (income), net 6,665 (1,938 ) 3,556 nm nm Provision for income taxes 304,452 237,076 193,625 28.4 % 22.4 % Effective tax rate 26.8 % 23.5 % 23.8 % 3.3 (0.3 ) Earnings from continuing operations 833,119 773,186 619,497 7.8 % 24.8 % Loss from discontinued operations, net (22,049 ) 122,057 80,607 nm 51.4 % Earnings from continuing operations per common share - diluted $ 4.53 $ 4.09 3.27 10.8 % 25.1 % Revenue Our 2012 consolidated revenue increased 10% to $8.1 billion, reflecting organic growth of 5%, growth from acquisitions of 6% and an unfavorable impact from currency translation of 1%. All four of our segments generated 2012 organic revenue growth, with the majority attributed to volume increases driven by strength in the energy, handset, refrigeration and food equipment, and many of the other industrial markets served by our Engineered Systems segment. Approximately 3% of our growth was generated by new products, particularly in our Communication Technologies segment, and geographic market expansion in our Energy segment. Pricing had a negligible impact to 2012 revenue, as price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs, were partly offset by lower strategic pricing initiatives. Revenues generated outside of the U.S. increased by 9% compared with 2011, with growth in Canada and Asia offsetting weakness in Europe. Over 80% of the 2012 revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by Sound Solutions, Maag Pump Systems, and Production Control Services, three of our more significant recent acquisitions made in the second half of 2011 and first half of 2012. Our 2011 consolidated revenue increased $1.3 billion or 21% compared with 2010, reflecting organic growth of 12%, growth from acquisitions of 7% and a favorable impact from currency translation of 2%. The majority of our 2011 organic growth was attributed to increased volumes across all four segments driven by strength in the energy and consumer handset markets and solid growth in fluid solutions, refrigeration equipment and many of the industrial markets served by our Engineered Systems segment. Additionally, approximately 2% of our growth was generated by new products, particularly in our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments. Pricing added about 1% to revenue principally driven by strategic pricing initiatives and price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs. Revenues generated outside of the U.S. increased by 25% compared with 2010, with revenue generated in emerging economies of China and Latin America increasing 56%. 26 Table of Contents Over 70% of the 2011 revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions, two large acquisitions that we made in 2011 to expand our operations serving the artificial lift and handset markets, respectively. Gross Profit Our gross profit increased $262.3 million or 9% in 2012 compared with 2011, reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes, favorable net material costs, and benefits from productivity initiatives. Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted 30 basis points in 2012 to 38.3% from 38.6% in 2011, with the reduction in large part due to the integration of Sound Solutions, which generated lower than anticipated revenue in 2012, more than offsetting the operating leverage achieved by our other businesses. Our gross profit increased $422.2 million or 17% in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes. However, gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted 110 basis points in 2011 to 38.6% from 39.7% in 2010 due principally to the impact of product and customer mix, which more than offset operating leverage, as well as the impact of higher depreciation from recent acquisitions. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $120.7 million or 7% in 2012 compared with 2011 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses declined to 22.7% in 2012 compared with 23.4% in 2011. This 70 basis point improvement is largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels, which more than offset higher acquisition-related amortization and increased restructuring charges. Selling and administrative expenses increased $221.4 million or 15% in 2011 compared with 2010 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses declined to 23.4% in 2011 compared with 24.5% in 2010. This 110 basis point improvement was largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels, which more than offset higher amortization and other nonrecurring expenses related to recent acquisitions. Non-Operating Items Interest expense, net, increased $5.6 million or 5% to $121.1 million in 2012 primarily due to lower average levels of cash on hand at reduced interest rates, leading to $4.4 million less of interest income in 2012 as compared with 2011. In 2011, our interest expense, net, increased 9% to $115.6 million due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings during 2011 as compared with 2010. As discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in February of 2011 we issued $800 million in new notes, receiving net proceeds of $789 million, approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire $400 million of notes which came due earlier that month, with the remainder used to fund first quarter 2011 acquisitions. As a result, our total borrowings were $380 million higher at the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2010. Other expense (income), net in 2012, 2011, and 2010 includes $9.5 million, $7.5 million, and $6.9 million, respectively, of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, offset in each of these years by royalty income and other miscellaneous non-operating gains and losses, none of which are individually significant. In 2010, other expense (income), net also includes a $4.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt relating to early settlement of a non-interest bearing, structured loan arrangement. Income Taxes We operate globally, and 38%, 43%, and 47% of our pre-tax earnings in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, were generated in foreign jurisdictions, where such earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are well below the 35% U.S. statutory rate. We also benefit from tax holidays and incentives in a number of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, our blended effective tax rate is typically significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. 27 Table of Contents The 2012 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 26.8% compared to the 2011 rate of 23.5%. The 2012 and 2011 rates were favorably impacted by net discrete items, principally settlements with U.S. federal and state taxing authorities totaling $16.1 million and $40.7 million, respectively. After adjusting for discrete items, the effective tax rates were 28.2% and 27.5% for 2012 and 2011, respectively. The higher pre-discrete rate in 2012 reflects the impact of a higher proportion of U.S. earnings, partly offset by lower effective tax rates on earnings generated in foreign jurisdictions. The 2010 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 23.8%. The effective tax rate in 2010 was also favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling $50.3 million, arising principally from settlements with the U.S. federal taxing authority, coupled with the resolution of a foreign tax matter. After adjusting for discrete and other items, the effective tax rate for 2010 was 30%, which was higher than the adjusted effective tax rate for 2011 of 27.5% due primarily to the geographic mix of earnings, with a greater proportion of our non-U.S. earnings generated in foreign jurisdictions having higher tax rates than in 2011, when more of the non-U.S. earnings were generated in foreign jurisdictions having lower tax rates on average. We believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. This decrease may result in an income tax benefit. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to $140 million. Some portion of such change may be reported as discontinued operations. We believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Earnings from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 8% to $833.1 million, or $4.53 diluted earnings per share ("EPS") in 2012, compared with earnings from continuing operations of $773.2 million, or $4.09 EPS, in 2011. The increase in 2012 earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives, offset in part by higher acquisition-related expenses and increased restructuring charges relative to 2011. The EPS increase reflects the increase in earnings, as well as the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding for the 2012 period relative to 2011. As discussed in the "Financial Condition" section of this MD&A, we have repurchased incrementally more common shares in 2012 as compared to 2011. Earnings from continuing operations increased 25% to $773.2 million, or $4.09 EPS in 2011, compared with earnings from continuing operations of $619.5 million, or $3.27 EPS, in 2010. The increase in 2011 dollar earnings and EPS from continuing operations was primarily the result of higher revenues and the lower effective tax rate relative to 2010. Discontinued Operations We did not dispose of any businesses in 2012. However, in the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to divest Everett Charles Technologies (including the Multitest business, collectively "ECT") and DEK International ("DEK"), two non-core businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets. The results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $63.8 million ($51.9 million, net of tax) in connection with the intended divestiture of ECT. As a result, in 2012, we generated a net after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $22.0 million, or a loss of $0.12 EPS, reflecting $30.0 million of net earnings from the operations of these businesses along with minor adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities, which were more than offset by the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge. We sold three businesses in the third and fourth quarters of 2011, and the operations of these businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations in 2011. Our net earnings from discontinued operations for 2011 totaled $122.1 million, or $0.65 EPS, and includes net earnings of $100.7 million from the operations of the businesses sold in 2011 and held for sale in 2012, coupled with tax benefits of $18.0 million and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities. Net earnings from discontinued operations also includes a $4.7 million loss on the 2011 sale of the three businesses, inclusive of goodwill impairment. For 2010, our net earnings from discontinued operations totaled $80.6 million, or $0.43 EPS, and includes net earnings of $80.7 million from the operations of the businesses sold in 2011 and held for sale in 2012, coupled with adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities, offset in part by a net loss of $14.2 million relating to the sale of a business that had been reflected as a discontinued operation in a previous year. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations. 28 Table of Contents Restructuring Activities 2012 Restructuring Activities During the year, we initiated restructuring actions relating to ongoing cost reduction efforts, including targeted facility consolidations and headcount reductions at certain businesses. As a result, in 2012, we incurred restructuring charges totaling $19.4 million related to these programs, as follows: The Communication Technologies segment incurred restructuring charges of $5.5 million, primarily relating to a facility consolidation and related headcount reductions within its operations that serve the telecom infrastructure market to better reflect the current market dynamics, along with headcount reductions undertaken to facilitate management changes and optimize the cost structure of its businesses serving the consumer electronics market. The Energy segment incurred restructuring charges of $0.7 million, primarily representing costs for the integration of recent acquisitions and minor headcount reductions. The Engineered Systems segment incurred restructuring charges of $7.5 million, mainly relating to facility consolidations and other headcount reduction programs undertaken to optimize its cost structure. The Printing & Identification segment incurred restructuring charges of $5.7 million, principally relating to rationalization of global headcount within its marking and coding businesses to better align its footprint with present market conditions. We expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $20 to $30 million in 2013 in connection with the above-mentioned projects, as well as certain other programs to be initiated during the year to rationalize headcount and optimize operations in a few select businesses. We anticipate that a significant portion of the 2013 charges will be incurred in the first quarter, with much of the benefit of the 2012 and 2013 programs being realized over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014. We also expect to fund the remainder of the 2012 programs currently underway, as well those commenced in 2013, over the next 12 to 18 months. In light of the economic uncertainty in certain of our end markets and our continued focus on improving our operating efficiency, it is possible that additional programs may be implemented throughout the remainder of 2013. 2011 and 2010 Restructuring Activities Restructuring initiatives in 2011 and 2010 were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations. We incurred restructuring charges of $5.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, relating to such activities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details regarding our recent restructuring activities. 29 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our four reportable operating segments (Communication Technologies, Energy, Engineered Systems, and Printing & Identification). Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple end markets. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment revenue, earnings, and operating margin to our consolidated revenue, earnings from continuing operations, and operating margin. Segment EBITDA and segment EBITDA margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. For further information, see the Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. Communication Technologies Our Communication Technologies segment is engaged in the design and manufacture of innovative products and components which serve the following key markets: Consumer Electronics, Medical Technology, Aerospace/Defense, and Telecom/Other. For the reporting within this Form 10-K, and on a go-forward basis, we have condensed our end market analysis into the four above-mentioned markets, reduced from the analysis of five end markets in our prior annual and quarterly reporting. Therefore, all prior year revenue information has been recast to be consistent with the current end-market designations.

The overall increase in revenue resulted primarily from increased microelectronic mechanical ( MEMs ) microphone volumes stemming from new product introductions and overall smart phone market growth, combined with a full year of revenue for Sound Solutions in 2012 compared to six months of revenue in 2011. Our MEMs revenue grew in excess of 25% over the 2011 level. The 2012 revenue increase was partially offset by strategic pricing initiatives for our communications and telecommunication products, corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities, and reduced volumes in certain end markets. Our revenue in the consumer electronics market (representing 47% of 2012 segment revenue) increased $165.8 million or 31% due to solid demand for components serving the handset market. This growth was tempered in part by delays in the launches of certain OEM products and operational challenges in the Sound Solutions business impacting its product rollouts which have led to lower volume for this portion of the business. As anticipated, our Sound Solutions business experienced improvement in revenue and margin in the fourth quarter of 2012 relative to earlier quarters, and we expect this trend to continue in 2013. Overall, our MEMs microphones remain well positioned to capitalize on this market's growth as we have continued to invest in capacity to meet the growing market demands. Our medical technology revenue (16% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $11.0 million or 5% due to increased hearing aid demand. Revenue derived from other medical products was unfavorably impacted by weakened European and Asian economic conditions. Revenue derived from our aerospace/defense market (27% of 2012 segment revenue) increased $13.7 million or 3% mainly due to continued increase in build rates of commercial aircraft and the timing and funding of key defense programs in which we participate. The defense market in Europe continues to be impacted by the weak macro-economic environment. We continue to experience weakened demand in the global telecom markets, driven in part by continued deferred industry investment. This contributed to a revenue decrease of $34.0 million or 18% from our telecom/other markets (10% of 2012 segment revenue). Communication Technologies earnings in 2012 decreased $7.4 million or 3% compared with 2011, with a decrease in operating margin of 220 basis points. The earnings and margin decreases were mainly due to lower margins from the integration of Sound Solutions including a full year of incremental depreciation and amortization compared to six months in 2011, new product ramp up costs and restructuring charges related to cost reduction activities, offset in part by productivity initiatives, leverage on higher MEMs volume, and the absence of one-time acquisition related costs associated with the Sound Solutions. Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2012 and backlog at December 31, 2012 indicate continued strength across each of our end markets, with the exception of our telecommunication/other market. 2011 Versus 2010 Revenue generated by our Communication Technologies segment increased $284.1 million or 26% compared with 2010, with $190.2 million, or 18% of the growth, attributed principally to the 2011 acquisition of Sound Solutions, which supplemented our product offerings in the growing handset market. Our organic revenue growth of 7% was largely due to continued strong demand for smart phones serving the consumer electronics market which grew significantly year over year. Although there was an incremental decrease in revenue due to strategic pricing initiatives for our communication and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities, this decrease was more than offset by revenue growth from market share gains, new product introductions and product mix. Our revenue in the consumer electronics market (representing 40% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $91.8 million or 35%, excluding Sound Solutions. Our MEMs microphones and SiSonic technologies were well positioned to capitalize on this market's growth as we have continued to invest in capacity to meet the growing market demands. Our medical technology revenue (17% of segment revenue) declined by $6.6 million or 3% principally due to softer hearing aid demand in the first half of 2011 and overall softer medical equipment demand. 31 Table of Contents Our aerospace/defense revenue (29% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $25.3 million or 7%. We experienced solid demand in the commercial aerospace market due to increased build rates of commercial aircraft by leading aircraft manufactures and increased demand for our aftermarket products globally. This increase was partially offset by revenue derived from our defense market mainly due to timing and funding of certain programs in which we participate. Our telecom/other revenue (14% of 2011 segment revenue) decreased $16.6 million or 8% due to weakened demand in the global telecom markets, driven in part by deferred industry investment due to service provider consolidation. Communication Technologies 2011 earnings increased 10% compared with 2010, but operating margin declined 250 basis points. The margin decline mainly resulted from higher acquisition related costs including incremental depreciation and amortization, higher raw material costs, and lower margins from the integration of the Sound Solutions acquisition. Excluding the impact of Sound Solutions, earnings would have increased by $36.6 million, or 18%, and operating margin would have increased by 160 basis points as compared with 2010. Energy Our Energy segment serves the oil, gas, and power generation industries with products that promote efficient and cost-effective drilling, extraction, storage, and movement of oil and gas products, or constitute critical components for power generation equipment. The Energy segment operates through the following business lines: Drilling, which comprises products supporting the cost-effective drilling of oil and gas wells; Production, which comprises products and components facilitating the extraction and movement of fuel from the ground; and Downstream, which comprises systems and products that support the efficient, safe, and environmentally-sensitive handling of fuel, hazardous liquids, and dry-bulk commodities.

The increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 9%, growth from the acquisitions of Production Control Services (in April 2012) and Oil Lift (in September 2011) totaling 5%, and a negligible impact from foreign currency translation. Pricing actions, mainly in response to increased raw material costs, represented approximately 2% of the revenue increase. Drilling revenue (representing 19% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $8.3 million or 2% due to an essentially flat level of drilling activity compared to 2011, which moderated demand for the segment's drilling products. Production revenue (54% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $213.0 million 22%, with 12% due to organic growth and 10% from acquisitions. Organic growth was driven by an increased number of active U.S. oil wells and wells with natural gas liquids driving demand for artificial lift products, higher international sales, and increased demand for compressor related products and winch products serving the infrastructure and recovery markets. Our revenues in the drilling sector, and to a smaller extent in the production sector, are impacted by changes in the number of active North American drilling rigs. In 2012, the average North American drilling rig count declined 1% compared to the prior year. We expect the North American rig count growth to turn positive in the second half of 2013. Downstream revenue (27% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $50.5 million or 10%, reflecting increased demand for loading equipment for the rail, cargo tank and chemical/industrial markets, bearing products serving energy markets, and fuel delivery systems. Energy earnings in 2012 increased $88.0 million or 20% primarily resulting from higher volume in the production and downstream sectors. Operating margin increased 110 basis points compared to the prior year due to improved operating leverage associated with higher volumes, strategic pricing, and productivity gains, which more than offset the impact of unfavorable product mix and higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization. Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2012 and backlog at December 31, 2012 increased 11% and 4%, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. We expect market conditions in 2013 to moderate compared to 2012, with continued geographic expansion and further penetration of new and acquired products and technologies are also expected to contribute to our growth in 2013. 2011 Versus 2010 Our Energy segment posted record organic revenue, earnings, and bookings in 2011. Revenue and earnings were up 46% and 43%, respectively, due to continued strength in the drilling, production, and downstream energy markets served by the segment. Recent acquisitions generated revenue growth of 19% and contributed to the segment record results. Sales outside of North America grew 35% driven by significantly higher sales to Central and South America, the Middle East, and Russia. Pricing actions, generally undertaken to offset commodity inflation, accounted for a marginal portion of the revenue increase. Drilling revenue (representing 21% of 2011 segment revenue) grew 34% due to increased exploration activity, pricing, and market share increases. Production revenue (51% of 2011 segment revenue) increased 72%, with 35% due to organic growth and 37% from acquisitions. The organic growth was driven by higher drilling and well completion activity, increased international sales, and higher demand for winch products serving the energy, infrastructure, and recovery markets. Our revenues in the drilling and production sectors are impacted by changes in the number of active North American drilling rigs. The average North American drilling rig count in 2011 was up 21% over the prior year, driven by strong oil prices. Downstream revenue (28% of 2011 segment revenue) was up 20%, with 14% from organic revenue growth and the balance from recent acquisitions. The organic growth reflected continued strong demand for products in the power generation, rail, cargo tank, and chemical/industrial markets, as well as nozzles and hanging hardware for retail fueling stations. 33 Table of Contents Energy earnings increased $134.5 million, or 43%, from the higher organic and acquisition volumes. Energy operating margin declined 60 basis points compared to the prior year, due to the impact of acquisition-related costs, including higher depreciation and amortization, and higher material costs, partially offset by improved operating leverage associated with the higher volumes, strategic pricing, and productivity gains. Engineered Systems Our Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Fluid Solutions and Refrigeration & Industrial. The Fluid Solutions platform designs and manufactures pumps, compressors, and chemical proportioning and dispensing products. The Refrigeration & Industrial platform manufactures products and systems which serve two key end-markets: Refrigeration & Food Equipment and Other Industrial.

Revenue of our Refrigeration & Industrial platform, which serves our refrigeration and food equipment and other industrial end-markets, increased $179.2 million or 7%. Revenue derived from refrigeration and food equipment markets (representing 40% of 2012 segment revenue) increased $132.6 million or 11%, with 2% of the revenue growth generated by the Anthony and Advansor acquisitions, and the remaining 9% of the growth reflecting solid demand for refrigeration systems fueled by remodel activity at major retail chains, as well as increased demand for foodservice equipment through dealer and direct channels and for beverage can-making equipment, especially in Asia. Revenue generated by our businesses serving other industrial markets (36% of 2012 segment revenue) increased $46.6 million or 4%. The increase was driven by higher demand for waste and recycling equipment and industrial automation machinery, along with increased demand for vehicle services in the important Asian markets and strong first-half demand for hydraulic equipment serving the mining and utility sectors. Revenue of our Fluid Solutions platform (24% of 2012 segment revenue) increased by $139.5 million or 21% reflecting the favorable impact of recent acquisitions, most notably Maag Pump Systems, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2012, partly offset by a 1% decline in organic revenue, primarily resulting from weakness in our European markets. Engineered Systems segment earnings in 2012 increased $56.8 million or 13% compared with 2011, due to the impact of recent acquisitions, favorable net material cost, and productivity improvements, partially offset by weakened Europe markets and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Operating margin increased 30 basis points compared to 2011, as favorable pricing and productivity benefits more than offset acquisition-related costs and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Segment bookings for 2012 and backlog at December 31, 2012 increased compared to 2011 levels, primarily from higher pump equipment orders associated with Maag. Our 2012 Refrigeration & Industrial year-end backlog level declined slightly compared to 2011, which included significant refrigeration bookings for Target's P-fresh remodeling project, which is nearing completion. 2011 Versus 2010 Engineered Systems 2011 revenue increased 11%, driven by organic revenue growth of 9%, favorable foreign currency of 1% and a negligible impact from recent acquisitions. Revenue of our refrigeration & industrial platform, which serves our refrigeration and food equipment, waste and recycling, and other industrial end-markets, increased $204.8 million or 9%. Revenue from refrigeration and food equipment (representing 40% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $98 million or 9% reflecting strong demand for refrigeration systems fueled by remodel activity at major retail chains. Performance by our businesses serving the waste and recycling and other industrial markets (38% of 2011 segment revenue) was driven by increased global demand for industrial automation machinery, improving demand for vehicle services in the important Asian markets and a market rebound in hydraulic equipment due in part to strength in the mining sector, partially offset by a double-digit decline in waste and recycling revenue given continued constraints on municipal spending. These factors combined to increase other industrial revenue by $106 million or 10%. Revenue of our fluid solutions platform (22% of 2011 segment revenue) increased by $110 million or 19% reflecting strong demand for pumps in the chemical, transport, and hygienic markets and increasing demand for heat exchange systems, coupled with the benefits from geographic expansion, particularly in Asia, and price increases necessary to cover rising commodity costs. 35 Table of Contents Engineered Systems segment earnings increased $62.5 million or 16% on the strength of increased volume. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points, as a result of positive pricing actions and productivity savings, which more than offset cost escalation and unfavorable product mix. Printing & Identification Our Printing & Identification segment is a worldwide supplier of precision marking and coding, printing, dispensing, soldering and coating equipment and related consumables and services. The segment serves two broad global end- markets: Fast Moving Consumer Goods ("FMCG") and Industrial. As discussed previously, two businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets, namely ECT and DEK, were reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2012, as we expect to divest these businesses in 2013. The discussion that follows addresses only the remaining continuing operations of the segment.

FMCG revenue (representing 59% of 2012 segment revenue) grew $7.7 million or 5% year-over-year, excluding a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Despite economic weakness in Europe, growth was driven by continued market acceptance of our new products and added sales and service resources in key regional markets. Industrial revenue (41% of 2012 segment revenue) contracted 1% compared with the prior year, excluding a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, reflecting weaker European and slowing Asia markets. P rinting & Identification segment earnings declined $6.4 million or 5% in 2012 compared to 2011, resulting in an operating margin decline of 40 basis points. The margin decline is primarily attributed to lower industrial end market volumes, key strategic investments for growth and restructuring expenses recognized in the first half of 2012, partially offset by ongoing productivity improvements and a partial year of restructuring savings. 36 Table of Contents Bookings for 2012 decreased 2% as compared to 2011, principally due to unfavorable currency, while backlog levels at December 31, 2012 increased 4% compared to the prior year end. 2011 Versus 2010 Printing & Identification segment 2011 revenue increased $64.6 million or 7% compared with 2010, with over 3% organic revenue growth and 3.5% favorable foreign currency impact. FMCG revenue (representing 58% of 2011 segment revenue) grew in excess of 3% year-over-year, excluding a 3.5% favorable impact from foreign currency, as new product introductions gained traction as the year progressed, offset partially by softening European markets at the end of the year. Industrial revenue (42% of 2011 segment revenue) was up similarly in excess of 3% versus the prior year, excluding a 3.5% favorable impact from foreign currency. Printing & Identification segment earnings declined $9.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010, resulting in an operating margin decline of 200 basis points. The margin decline is primarily attributed to unfavorable regional mix and new product introduction costs. We also completed several small employee reduction in force programs across targeted businesses to streamline operations and to align more closely with our growth in geographic end markets. Costs related to these programs were not significant. 37 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions. Cash Flow Summary The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Years Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations (in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 1,261,160 $ 948,864 $ 830,295 Investing activities (1,345,888 ) (1,012,430 ) (166,444 ) Financing activities (342,942 ) (50,501 ) (304,788 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased $312.3 million, primarily due to increased net earnings in 2012 and reduced investment in working capital relative to 2011. Higher sales volume increased 2012 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by $127 million as compared with 2011. Our net cash flow increased $129 million on the change in working capital year-over-year, as we converted working capital of approximately $31 million to cash in 2012, while we invested $98 million in working capital in 2011. Additionally, 2012 cash flow increased $77 million from the year-over-year change in income tax accruals. In 2012, our tax provision exceeded our payments leading to an increase in the accrued tax balance, while in 2011 we made tax payments in excess of the 2011 provision, in part due to 2011 settlement activity, which reduced the accrued tax balance. Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased $118.6 million, primarily due to increased earnings in 2011 and reduced investment in working capital relative to 2010. Higher sales volume increased 2011 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by $215 million as compared with 2010. Our investment in working capital was $59 million lower than in 2010, at which time a working capital build-up was necessary to support revenue levels recovering from the 2009 declines. These increases in cash flow were partially offset by $170 million of higher income tax payments resulting from our higher earnings and 2011 tax settlement activity, as well as higher employee incentive compensation payments and reductions in deferred revenue. Pension and Post-Retirement Activity. Post-retirement costs relating to pension and other employee-related defined benefit plans affect results in all segments. We recorded net periodic benefit costs of $44 million, $40 million, and $33 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit, supplemental, and post-retirement plans). The main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value plan obligations, expected returns on plan assets, the service and interest costs, and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses. In 2012, the actual return on plan assets increased consistent with increased returns within the global equity markets. In 2011, the actual return on U.S. plan assets increased, while returns on our non-U.S. plans declined, as a result of the different mix of investments in the plans. In 2013, we expect our net periodic benefit cost to be approximately $60 million, with the increase compared to 2012 being attributed to the lower discount rates used to value the post-retirement obligations, higher amortization relating to unrecognized asset losses, and an increase in participants in our supplemental retirement plans. The funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates, and the level of funding. We contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. At December 31, 2012, the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit plans reflected underfunding by $153 million, which includes $49 million relating to the U.S. Dover Corporate Pension Plan and $103 million relating to our significant international pension plans, some in locations where it is not economically advantageous to pre-fund the plans due to local regulations. The majority of the international obligations relate 38 Table of Contents to defined pension plans operated by our businesses in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. Cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2012, 2011, and 2010 totaled $28 million, $49 million, and $38 million, respectively. In 2013, we expect to contribute $20 to $40 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan and approximately $14 million to our non-U.S. plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our post-retirement plans. Adjusted Working Capital. In 2012, Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from 2011 by $111 million, or 8%, to $1.4 billion, which reflected an increase in receivables of $107 million, an increase in net inventory of $139 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $135 million, generally due to the impact of 2012 acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of $11 million, Adjusted Working Capital would have decreased by $30 million, or 2%. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities results from cash outflows for capital expenditures, acquisitions, and short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses, property, plant and equipment, and short-term investments. In 2012, we used cash in investing activities of $1.3 billion compared to $1.0 billion in 2011, driven by the following factors: Acquisitions . In 2012, we used $1.0 billion to acquire seven businesses, including $266 million for Maag Pump Systems, a European acquisition for our Fluid Solutions platform, $119 million for the cash portion of the purchase price paid for PCS, a second quarter acquisition in our Energy segment, and $603 million for Anthony International, a fourth quarter acquisition for our Refrigeration & Industrial platform. A portion of the PCS acquisition was also funded by the issuance of Dover stock valued at $101 million at the date of acquisition. Cash paid for the 2012 acquisitions is net of $45 million received as final payment for settlement of purchase price adjustments for post-acquisition contingencies relating to the 2011 Sound Solutions acquisition by our Communication Technologies segment. In comparison, in 2011, we used $1.4 billion to acquire nine businesses, including $401 million for the acquisition of Harbison-Fischer by our Energy segment and $824 million for the acquisition of Sound Solutions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions. Capital spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation, and cost savings, were $297 million in 2012 and $263 million in 2011. Our capital expenditures were approximately $34 million higher in the 2012 period as compared to 2011, reflecting continued investment in capacity expansion to support growth in the handset market with significant investments to increase MEMs manufacturing capacity in our domestic and Asian facilities, along with other investments supporting growth in our energy production end markets. We expect 2013 capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to approximate 3.5%. Proceeds from sale of businesses. In 2011, we generated cash of $517 million, primarily from the sale of Paladin Brands, Crenlo, and Heil Trailer, three businesses that had operated in our Engineered Systems segment. Short-term investments. We typically invest cash in excess of near-term requirements in short-term investments. In 2011, we generated proceeds of $124 million from the sale of short-term investments, which were liquidated to provide cash for 2011 acquisitions. We held no short-term investments during 2012. We anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make through the remainder of 2013 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, the use of established lines of credit, or accessing the public debt or equity markets. 39 Table of Contents Financing Activities Our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options. For 2012, we used cash of $343 million for financing activities compared to $51 million in 2011, with the activity attributed to the following: Long-term debt . In the 2012 period, we had negligible reductions in long-term debt. However, in the 2011 period, we received proceeds of $789 million from the issuance of 4.3% 10-year Notes due 2021 and 5.375% 30-year Notes due 2041. These proceeds were used to fund acquisitions made in the first quarter of 2011 and repay $400 million of other borrowings which came due during the period. Notes payable. In December 2012, we received proceeds of $608 million from commercial paper issued principally to fund the fourth quarter Anthony acquisition. Treasury purchases . In November 2012, Dover's Board of Directors approved an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program, to drive additional shareholder value. As a result, our 2012 activity includes incremental share buy-backs under the above-mentioned program and the repurchase of shares to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued for the second quarter acquisition of PCS, in addition to the typical repurchase of shares to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under our equity compensation plans. In total, we used $749 million in 2012 to purchase 12.3 million shares of our common stock in the open market. In 2011, we purchased approximately 4.0 million shares for $242 million. Dividend payments . Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $241 million in 2012 and $219 million in 2011. Our dividends per common share increased 13% to $1.33 per share in 2012 compared to $1.18 per share in 2011. This represents the 57th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options . We received $43 million from employee exercises of stock options in 2012, compared to $40 million in 2011, with the variance attributed to a greater number of options exercised in the 2012 period. Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations In 2012, 2011, and 2010 our businesses reported as discontinued operations generated cash flow of $5 million, $117 million, and $100 million, respectively. The 2011 and 2010 amounts reflect cash flows from the three businesses sold in the third and fourth quarters of 2011, as well as cash flows from the two businesses reclassified to discontinued operations in 2012. The significant decrease in 2012 cash flows from discontinued operations, relative to the prior years, reflects a significant decrease in 2012 earnings from the businesses reclassified in 2012, as well as the the absence of cash flows from the businesses sold in 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources Free Cash Flow In addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). We believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions, and repurchase our common stock. For further information, see the Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. The following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities: Years Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow (dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 1,261,160 $ 948,864 $ 830,295 Less: Capital expenditures (297,012 ) (262,676 ) (169,297 ) Free cash flow $ 964,148 $ 686,188 $ 660,998 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 11.9 % 9.3 % 10.8 % 40 Table of Contents For 2012, we generated free cash flow of $964.1 million, representing 11.9% of revenue and 115.7% of earnings from continuing operations, while continuing to make investments necessary to support our growth. Free cash flow in 2011 was $686.2 million or 9.3% of revenue, compared to $661.0 million, or 10.8% of revenue in 2010. The increase in 2012 free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and a $129 million positive change in working capital year-over-year, offset in part by higher capital expenditures in 2012 necessary to fund expansion in the Company high-growth businesses. We expect to generate free cash flow in 2013 of approximately 10% of revenue, consistent with our historical performance. The 2011 increase in free cash flow compared to 2010 reflects higher earnings from continuing operations and lower investment in working capital, partially offset by higher tax payments and increased capital expenditures in 2011. Net Debt to Net Capitalization We utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: Net Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio (dollars in thousands) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Current maturities of long-term debt $ 3,266 $ 1,022 $ 1,590 Commercial paper 607,500 15,000 Long-term debt 2,189,350 2,186,230 1,790,886 Total debt 2,800,116 2,187,252 1,807,476 Less: Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments (800,076 ) (1,206,755 ) (1,309,095 ) Net debt 2,000,040 980,497 498,381 Add: Stockholders' equity 4,919,230 4,930,555 4,526,562 Net capitalization $ 6,919,270 $ 5,911,052 $ 5,024,943 Net debt to net capitalization 28.9 % 16.6 % 9.9 % Our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at December 31, 2012 compared to the prior year-end, primarily due to the use of cash and borrowings to fund acquisitions totaling $1.0 billion during the year. Total borrowings are higher by $613 million at December 31, 2012, primarily due to commercial paper issued in the fourth quarter to fund acquisitions. We expect to replace these commercial paper borrowings with long-term fixed rate notes in 2013. Our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at December 31, 2011 compared to the 2010 year end primarily due to the use of cash and debt to fund acquisitions totaling $1.4 billion during the year. Total net borrowings increased by $380 million during 2011, primarily due to $789 million net proceeds received from the 4.3% 10-year Notes due 2021 and 5.375% 30-year Notes due 2041 issued in February, approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire $400 million of notes which came due earlier in February 2011. In 2011, we also received cash proceeds of $517 million, primarily from the sale of three businesses. We use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. We currently maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to $1 billion and expires on November 10, 2016. This facility is used primarily as liquidity back-up for our commercial paper program. We have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so. If we were to draw down a loan, at our election, the loan would bear interest at a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.565% to 1.225% (subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moody s) or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility. Under this facility, we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. We were in compliance with this covenant and our other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2012 and had a coverage ratio of 13.9 to 1. We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 41 Table of Contents We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC with remaining capacity of $1 billion that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. At December 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $800 million, of which approximately $700 million was held outside the United States. Cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturities of three months or less. We regularly invest cash in excess of near-term requirements in short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months, up to twelve months. We held no short-term investments at December 31, 2012 or 2011. If our cash held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under current law, it would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. The cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. Management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States. Our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing. Our credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, were as follows as of December 31, 2012 : Short Term Rating Long Term Rating Outlook Moody's P-1 A2 Stable Standard & Poor's A-1 A Stable Fitch F1 A Stable We believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2012 , we had approximately $96.7 million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions, which expire at various dates in 2013 through 2017 . These letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which we believe is remote. We have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax, and employment matters. We do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities. 42 Table of Contents A summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2012 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Other (5) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,192,616 $ 3,266 $ 302,086 $ $ 1,887,264 $ Interest expense (2) 1,816,585 117,788 232,529 206,326 1,259,942 Rental commitments 271,505 63,228 87,534 47,206 73,537 Purchase obligations (3) 41,660 35,245 6,401 14 Capital leases 6,839 2,552 2,644 855 788 Supplemental & post-retirement benefits (4) 167,976 21,045 44,299 21,939 80,693 Uncertain tax positions (5) 214,064 1,214 212,850 Total obligations $ 4,711,245 $ 244,338 $ 675,493 $ 276,340 $ 3,302,224 $ 212,850 _________ (1 ) See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts represent total long-term debt, including current maturities. (2 ) Amounts represent estimate of future interest payments on long-term debt using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2012. (3 ) Amount includes purchase obligations totaling $36,473 relating to businesses reported within discontinued operations at December 31, 2012. (4 ) Amounts represent estimated benefit payments under our supplemental and post-retirement benefit plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also expect to contribute approximately $20 to $40 million to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2013, which amount is not reflected in the above table. (5 ) Amount in "Other" column includes $63,059 reported within discontinued operations at December 31, 2012. Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, we are unable to estimate the timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2013. These amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. Financial Instruments and Risk Management The diverse nature of our businesses activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. We periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties. Interest Rate Exposure We may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2012 , we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts. We issue commercial paper, which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates; however, maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pre-tax earnings. We consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2012 year-end fair value of our long-term debt by approximately $250 million. However, since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position. 43 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exposure We conduct business in various non-U.S. countries, primarily in Canada, Mexico, substantially all of the European countries, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, China, India, and other Asian countries. Therefore, we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks, when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities. We have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and/or cash flow hedging programs. We have not had material foreign currency hedging activity in recent years. Changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows when translated into U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. The strengthening of the U.S dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. We have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in non-U.S. operations. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges, and at December 31, 2012 , we had one outstanding floating-to-floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50 million in exchange for CHF 65.1 million , which matures on October 15, 2015. This transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations. The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings, with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings. The fair values at December 31, 2012 and 2011 reflected cumulative losses of $22.7 million and $21.7 million , respectively, due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar over the term of this arrangement. Commodity Price Exposure Certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities, such as aluminum, steel, copper, and various precious metals, among others. Our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials. When possible, we maintain long-term fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts; however, we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing; however, we had no such contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts we report. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk, and our financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1. The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to GAAP and is consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis. Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. Service revenue represents less than 10% of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed. In limited cases, our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification, or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized. We do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements. Inventories for the majority of our subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventories are stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories. Businesses within our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments tend to experience somewhat higher levels 44 Table of Contents of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. We have significant tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Our assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or, when indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate, or when a significant portion of a reporting unit is to be reclassified to discontinued operations, during the interim periods. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analyses (i.e. an income approach) which incorporate management assumptions relating to future growth and profitability. Changes in business or market conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such analyses. We believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We performed the annual impairment testing of our 17 identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2012 , and the fair value of 16 of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value by at least 20% and, in most cases, significantly more. If the fair value of each of these reporting units was decreased by 10%, the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized. The testing of the goodwill of our ECT business upon reclassification to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter resulted in a goodwill impairment on the basis of the fair value assumptions predicated on an anticipated sale. As a result, we computed a goodwill impairment of $63.8 million ($54.9 million, net of tax) that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012 within the results of discontinued operations. The valuation of our pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. Annually, we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams. The plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. As disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2012 weighted-average discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit, supplemental, and other post-retirement obligations ranged from 3.31% to 4.05%, reduced from the 2011 rates, which ranged from 4.45% to 4.85%. The reduced discount rates are reflective of the decline in global market interest rates over these periods. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately $43.1 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2012 . Our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately $1.7 million. We have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated, using more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state, and international issues that are currently unresolved. We routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves. Reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and our future taxable income levels. The provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes. 45 Table of Contents We have significant accruals and reserves related to the self-insured portion of our risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. We estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, our experience, and relevant industry data. We review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience. We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues. While we believe that the amount accrued to-date is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. Occasionally, we will establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These liabilities, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. We will from time to time discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, including goodwill, to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. Fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar-type entities. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. As noted above, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $63.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, as determined at the time one of our reporting units was reclassified to discontinued operations. We will continue to evaluate the businesses held for sale for impairment at each reporting period. We are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, and performance share awards. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SARs and stock options granted to employees. The model requires that we estimate the expected life of the SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data. We use the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also require us to estimate the volatility of our stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of our peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04 which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2012 and its adoption did not significantly impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU only requires a change in the format of the current presentation. The Company adopted this guidance for its 2011 year-end reporting, presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings. 46 Table of Contents In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2012. Its adoption did not impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09 which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer participation in multiemployer pension plans. The standard is intended to provide more information about an employer financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates. This guidance became effective for the Company for its fiscal 2011 year-end reporting. Its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Per the terms of this ASU, an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the entity determines, based on qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The revised standard is effective for Dover for its annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. The Company does not expect adoption of this ASU to significantly impact its consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we also disclose non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful information to investors. Segment EBITDA, segment EBITDA margin, free cash flow, net debt, total debt, net capitalization, the net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, earnings, revenue, or working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that segment EBITDA and segment EBITDA margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings. Segment margin is calculated as segment EBITDA divided by segment revenue. We believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt, and repurchase our common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt, and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. We believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes called working capital ), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes, given the global nature of our businesses. We believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth, which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.
