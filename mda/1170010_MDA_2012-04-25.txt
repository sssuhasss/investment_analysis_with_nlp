Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All references to net earnings per share are to diluted net earnings per share. Amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding. In fiscal 2012, we revised our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to correct our accounting for sale-leaseback transactions. See Note 2(K) for additional information. As of March 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting rules related to securitizations that affected the timing of the recognition of CarMax Auto Finance ( CAF ) income and resulted in the consolidation of the auto loan receivables and related non-recourse notes payable that previously were reflected as off-balance sheet items. The new rules were adopted on a prospective basis and prior year balances have not been restated. See Notes 2(E), 3, 4 and 5 for additional information. BUSINESS OVERVIEW General CarMax is the nation largest retailer of used vehicles. We pioneered the used car superstore concept, opening our first store in 1993. Our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated, proprietary management information systems. As of February 29, 2012, we operated 108 used car superstores in 53 markets, comprising 41 mid-sized markets, 11 large markets and 1 small market. We define mid-sized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600,000 and 2.5 million people. We also operated four new car franchises. During fiscal 2012, we sold 408,080 used cars, representing 98% of the total 415,759 vehicles we sold at retail. We believe the CarMax consumer offer is distinctive within the auto retailing marketplace. Our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other big box retailers. Our consumer offer is structured around our four customer benefits: low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection; high quality vehicles; and a customer-friendly sales process. Our website, carmax.com, is a valuable tool for communicating the CarMax consumer offer, a sophisticated search engine and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct their shopping online. We generate revenues, income and cash flows primarily by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing, extended service plans ( ESPs ), a guaranteed asset protection ( GAP ) product and vehicle repair service. GAP is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. We also generate revenues, income and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. These vehicles are sold through on-site wholesale auctions. Wholesale auctions are generally held on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and as of February 29, 2012, we conducted auctions at 52 used car superstores. During fiscal 2012, we sold 316,649 wholesale vehicles. On average, the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100,000 miles. Participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers, the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers. CarMax provides financing to qualified retail customers through CAF, our finance operation, and our arrangements with several industry-leading financial institutions. As of February 29, 2012, these third parties included Capital One Auto Finance, Santander Consumer USA, Wells Fargo Dealer Services and American Credit Acceptance. Third-party providers purchasing subprime finance contracts generally purchase these contracts at a discount, while providers purchasing prime and non-prime finance contracts generally pay us a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract. We periodically test additional third-party providers. We have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with third-party providers. We offer financing through CAF to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at CarMax. CAF utilizes proprietary customized scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer, along with CAF historical experience, to predict the likelihood of customer repayment. CAF offers customers an array of competitive rates and terms, 19 Table of Contents allowing them to choose the ones that best fit their needs. In addition, customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges. We randomly test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and 3-day payoffs to assess market competitiveness. After the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, CAF financed 37% of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2012. As of February 29, 2012, CAF serviced approximately 414,000 customers in its $4.98 billion portfolio of managed receivables. We sell ESPs and GAP on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors. As of February 29, 2012, the used vehicle third-party ESP providers were CNA National Warranty Corporation and The Warranty Group, and the third-party GAP provider was Safe-Guard Products International, LLC. We have no contractual liability to the customer under these third-party plans. ESP revenue represents commissions received on the sale of ESPs and GAP from the unrelated third parties. Over the long term, we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base. We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and our inventory management practices reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit. We employ a volume-based strategy, and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement. In December 2008, we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment. We resumed store growth in fiscal 2011, opening three superstores that year and five superstores in fiscal 2012. We plan to open 10 superstores in fiscal 2013 and between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following 3 fiscal years. While we have more than 100 superstores, we are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept, and as of February 29, 2012, we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 50% of the U.S. population. The principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to build our management bench strength to support our store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at favorable terms. We staff each newly opened store with associates who have extensive CarMax training. Therefore, we must recruit, train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings. Fiscal 2012 Highlights Net sales and operating revenues increased 11% to $10.00 billion from $8.98 billion in fiscal 2011, while net earnings increased 10% to $413.8 million, or $1.79 per share, from $377.5 million, or $1.65 per share. Total used vehicle revenues increased 9% to $7.83 billion versus $7.21 billion in fiscal 2011. The average used vehicle selling price rose 5%, primarily reflecting increases in our acquisition costs, which were affected by a year-over-year increase in used vehicle wholesale values. Total used vehicle unit sales rose 3%, reflecting the combination of a 1% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. We believe the modest rate of increase in comparable store sales reflected both a challenging sales comparison with fiscal 2011, when comparable store used unit sales increased 10%, and the continuation of weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence for much of the current fiscal year. Total wholesale vehicle revenues increased 32% to $1.72 billion versus $1.30 billion in fiscal 2011. Wholesale vehicle unit sales increased 20%, reflecting a significant increase in appraisal traffic. The average wholesale vehicle selling price rose 10%, due to the year-over-year increase in industry wholesale prices. Total gross profit increased 6% to $1.38 billion compared with $1.30 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase was largely driven by improvements in our wholesale and used vehicle gross profits, partially offset by a decrease in other gross profit. Wholesale vehicle gross profits increased 26% due the combination of the 20% growth in unit sales and a 5% increase in gross profit per unit. Used vehicle gross profits improved 4%, primarily reflecting the 3% increase in unit sales. Other gross profit declined 10% due to reductions in both third-party finance fees and service department profits. CAF income increased 19% to $262.2 million versus $220.0 million in fiscal 2011. Interest and fee income increased $29.6 million primarily due to the growth in average managed receivables, while at the same time interest expense declined $27.7 million as a larger portion of our portfolio of managed receivables was funded 20 Table of Contents with lower-cost securitizations. The provision for loan losses increased to $36.4 million from $27.7 million in fiscal 2011, reflecting the combination of the growth in average managed receivables and the cumulative effect of the origination and retention of loans with higher risk, partly offset by favorable loss experience in fiscal 2012. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses rose 7% to $940.8 million from $878.8 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in SG&A was driven by expansion of our store base, higher growth-related costs, increases in sales commissions and other variable costs, and higher advertising expense. Growth-related costs include store pre-opening expenses, relocation expenses, and the costs of maintaining store management bench strength to support future growth. SG&A per used unit rose 4% to $2,305 from $2,218 in fiscal 2011. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales and operating revenues (the SG&A ratio ), fell to 9.4% from 9.8% in fiscal 2011 reflecting the leverage associated with the increases in used and wholesale vehicle sales, and average selling prices. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $62.2 million in fiscal 2012 compared with $6.8 million in fiscal 2011. These amounts included increases in auto loan receivables of $675.7 million and $304.7 million, respectively. The majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are reflected as cash provided by financing activities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions. Note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed. Financing and Securitization Transactions We maintain a revolving securitization program comprised of two warehouse facilities ( warehouse facilities ) to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by CAF until they can be funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement. As of March 1, 2010, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) Nos. 2009-16 and 2009-17 on a prospective basis. Pursuant to these pronouncements, we now recognize all transfers of auto loan receivables into either our warehouse facilities or term securitizations as secured borrowings, which results in recording the auto loan receivables and the related non-recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets. Also pursuant to these pronouncements, beginning in fiscal 2011, CAF income included in the consolidated statements of earnings no longer includes a gain on the sale of loans through securitization transactions, but instead primarily reflects the interest and fee income associated with the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, direct CAF expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses. Auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers primarily related to used retail vehicle sales financed through CAF and are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses. The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months. The allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables, historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves. We also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses, recovery rates and the economic environment. The provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance. See Notes 2(E), 2(H), 4 and 5 for additional information on auto loan receivables and securitizations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. We recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered, net of a reserve for returns under our 5-day, money-back guarantee. A reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends, and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages. 21 Table of Contents We also sell ESPs and GAP on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle. Because we are not the primary obligor under these plans, we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale, net of a reserve for returns. The reserve for cancellations is recorded based on historical experience and trends, and results could be affected if future cancellations differ from historical averages. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions. We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. See Note 9 for additional information on income taxes. We evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider available carrybacks, future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income. Except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration, we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of February 29, 2012, will more likely than not be realized. However, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination.

The 9% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2012 resulted from a 5% increase in average retail selling price and a 3% increase in unit sales. The growth in the average retail selling price primarily reflected increases in our acquisition costs, which resulted from the year-over-year increase in used vehicle wholesale industry values. Used vehicle valuations remained strong in fiscal 2012 as the overall supply of used vehicles being remarketed continued to be constrained following three years of new car industry sales at rates significantly below pre-recession levels. A shift in our sales mix moderated the effect of higher acquisition costs on our average retail selling price. During fiscal 2012, 5- to 10-year old vehicles, which generally have lower selling prices than later-model vehicles, represented an increased portion of our sales mix. Our sales mix by make, model and vehicle age will vary from period to period, reflecting changing consumer preferences. The 3% increase in used unit sales included a 1% increase in comparable store used unit sales, together with sales from superstores not yet included in the comparable store base. We believe the modest rate of comparable store used unit sales growth reflected both a challenging sales comparison with fiscal 2011, when comparable store used unit sales increased 10%, and the continuation of weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence for much 23 Table of Contents of the current fiscal year. While customer traffic at comparable stores was higher than in the prior year, a larger portion of the current year traffic represented customers who only obtained vehicle appraisals, which contributed to a decline in sales conversion. Our data indicated that we increased our share of the late model (0-to 6-year old) used vehicle market by approximately 3% in fiscal 2012. We achieved market share growth despite a shift within the market for 0- to 6-year old vehicles towards older used vehicles and having fewer immature stores (those less than five years old) in our store base due to our temporary suspension of store growth. Historically, market share gains are strongest among immature stores. We remain confident that the strength of our consumer offer and the skill of our associates, combined with our resumption of store growth, will continue to drive future share gains. Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. The 16% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2011 resulted from an 11% increase in unit sales and a 5% increase in average retail selling price. The 11% unit sales growth reflected a 10% increase in comparable store used unit sales combined with sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base. The increase in comparable store unit sales primarily reflected the benefit of the continuing gradual rebound in customer traffic, as well as an increase in the sales conversion rate. We believe the sales conversion rate benefited from increased customer access to credit. The increase in the average retail selling price primarily reflected increases in our vehicle acquisition costs resulting from appreciation in wholesale industry used vehicle values. Our data indicated that we increased our share of the late-model used vehicle market by approximately 7% in fiscal 2011. We believe our ability to grow market share year after year is a reflection of the strength of our consumer offer, the skill of our associates and the preference for our brand. New Vehicle Sales As of February 29, 2012, we had a total of four new car franchises representing the Toyota, Nissan and Chrysler brands. In June 2011, we terminated the Chrysler franchise at one of our Los Angeles used car superstores to provide additional space for used vehicle operations. In October 2010, we ceased operations at our Chevrolet franchise in Kenosha, Wisconsin, following the termination of this franchise by General Motors. These franchise terminations did not have a material effect on sales or earnings. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. New vehicle revenues increased 1% in fiscal 2012, reflecting an 8% increase in average retail selling price, largely offset by a 7% reduction in new vehicle unit sales. Based on industry data, new light vehicle sales increased 9% to 13.0 million units from 11.9 million units in fiscal 2011, although, they remained significantly below the 16 million to 17 million unit range routinely achieved between 2000 and 2007. Compared with industry sales trends, our new vehicle unit sales were adversely affected by the Chrysler franchise termination and the effect of temporary new vehicle supply shortages following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. These shortages had a disproportionate effect on our new vehicles sales, given our brand mix. Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. New vehicle revenues increased 6% in fiscal 2011 due to a 5% rise in unit sales and a 2% increase in average retail selling price. The growth in our unit sales was achieved against a backdrop of improving new vehicle industry sales. Based on industry data, new light vehicle industry sales increased 13% to 11.9 million units from 10.5 million units in fiscal 2010. The wind down of our Chevrolet franchise, which was one of many franchises terminated by General Motors, partially offset the growth in our new vehicle unit sales. Wholesale Vehicle Sales Our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering high-quality vehicles. Fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale. Those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through on-site wholesale auctions. Our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles wholesaled. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. The 32% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2012 resulted from a 20% increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 10% increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The increase in unit sales primarily reflected a significant increase in appraisal traffic. While the appraisal buy rate remained high relative to historical averages, it declined modestly from the prior year. Our appraisal traffic benefited from the increase in customer traffic in our stores and from the lift in new car industry sales and related used vehicle trade-in activity in fiscal 2012. 24 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. The 54% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2011 resulted from a 33% increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 16% increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The growth in unit sales reflected strong increases in both appraisal traffic and our appraisal buy rate. Our appraisal traffic benefited from the increase in customer traffic in our stores and from the lift in new car industry sales and related used vehicle trade-in activity in fiscal 2011. We believe the strong wholesale pricing environment and the resulting increases in our appraisal offers had a favorable effect on the appraisal buy rate. Other Sales and Revenues Other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of ESPs and GAP (reported in ESP revenues), service department sales and net third-party finance fees. For providers who pay us a fixed fee per vehicle financed, this fee varies, reflecting the differing levels of credit risk exposure. The third-party providers who purchase subprime finance contracts generally purchase these contracts at a discount, which is reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received on other third-party finance contracts. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. Other sales and revenues declined 4% in fiscal 2012, as a 3% increase in ESP revenues was more than offset by a decrease in third-party finance fees resulting from a mix change among providers. Subprime providers financed 10% of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2012 compared with 8% in fiscal 2011. The reduction in third-party finance fees also reflected the decision by CAF to retain an increased portion of the loans that third-party providers had been purchasing following CAF tightening of lending standards beginning in fiscal 2010. As CAF retained an increased portion of these loans, the fees previously received from third parties declined. We expect that this decision will be accretive to our earnings over time. Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. Other sales and revenues increased 8% in fiscal 2011, primarily fueled by an increase in ESP revenues. ESP revenues climbed 20%, reflecting the 11% growth in used unit sales and an increase in ESP penetration, due in part to refinements in the plan design implemented in fiscal 2011. ESP revenues also benefited from a slowdown in the rate of ESP cancellations and from having a full year of GAP revenues in fiscal 2011 following the roll out of this product in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Service department sales were similar to the prior year, as service resources were used primarily in reconditioning vehicles to support the retail unit sales growth. Net third-party finance fees declined as a result of a mix shift among providers. The total percent of sales financed by the third parties increased in fiscal 2011 due, in part, to arrangements with these providers to purchase a portion of the loans that previously would have been originated by CAF. The increase in third-party penetration was more than offset, however, by the effect of an increase in the percentage of sales financed by our subprime financing providers. The subprime providers financed 8% of retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2011 compared with 6% in fiscal 2010.

(2) Calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue. Used Vehicle Gross Profit We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit. We employ a volume-based strategy, and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement. When customer traffic and sales are consistently strong, we generally take fewer pricing markdowns, which in turn benefits gross profit dollars per unit. When the sales pace slows, we may initially take more pricing markdowns, which could pressure gross profit dollars per unit. However, as we are successful in reducing inventories to align them with a slower sales pace, this may allow us to return to target levels of gross profit per unit. Other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs, changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment. Over the past several years, we have continued to refine our car-buying strategies, which we believe has benefited used vehicle gross profit per unit. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. Used vehicle gross profit increased $34.5 million, or 4%, to $888.6 million from $854.0 million in fiscal 2011, reflecting the combination of the 3% increase in used unit sales and a 1% improvement in gross profit per unit. Used vehicle gross profit per unit increased $21 to $2,177 per unit compared with $2,156 per unit in fiscal 2011. Our shift to selling an increased mix of 5- to 10-year old vehicles in fiscal 2012 increased our average reconditioning cost per unit, as older vehicles typically require more reconditioning effort. However, the older vehicles we sold were generally no less profitable than newer models. In recent years, we have worked to eliminate waste from our vehicle reconditioning process through the emphasis on the consistent application of reconditioning standards across our entire store base. Adjusting for the increase in average age of vehicles reconditioned and sold in fiscal 2012, we sustained the $250 per unit savings achieved in prior years. Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. Used vehicle gross profit increased $114.2 million, or 15%, to $854.0 million from $739.9 million in fiscal 2010, reflecting the combination of the 11% increase in used unit sales and a 4% improvement in gross profit per unit. Used vehicle gross profit per unit increased $84 to $2,156 per unit compared with $2,072 per unit in fiscal 2010. The improvement in gross profit per unit resulted from a combination of factors, including benefits realized from our ongoing initiatives to improve vehicle reconditioning efficiency and reduce waste, the support provided by the strong wholesale pricing environment and a modest increase in the percentage of retail vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process. Vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction. As of the end of fiscal 2011, we estimated our efforts to eliminate waste from our reconditioning processes in recent years have allowed us to achieve a sustainable reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately $250 per vehicle, on a cumulative basis. New Vehicle Gross Profit Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. New vehicle gross profit increased to $6.5 million from $5.4 million in fiscal 2011. The improvement was the result of a $188 increase in gross profit per unit to $847 per unit from $659 per unit 26 Table of Contents in fiscal 2011, partially offset by the 7% reduction in new vehicle unit sales. New vehicle gross profit per unit benefited from a reduction in discounting by new car manufacturers and dealers in the months following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. New vehicle gross profit declined to $5.4 million from $6.7 million in fiscal 2010. The reduction occurred as the benefit of the 5% increase in new vehicle unit sales was more than offset by a $199 reduction in gross profit per unit to $659 per unit from $858 per unit in fiscal 2010. Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit Our wholesale vehicle gross profit has steadily increased over the last several years reflecting, in part, the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our car-buying strategies, appraisal delivery processes and in-store auction processes. We have made continuous improvements in these processes, which we believe have allowed us to become more efficient. Our in-store auctions have benefited from initiatives to increase our dealer-to-car ratio, which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices. In addition, the frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. Wholesale vehicle gross profit increased $63.0 million, or 26%, to $301.8 million from $238.8 million in fiscal 2011. The improvement reflected the 20% increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 5% rise in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit. Wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit increased $45 to $953 per unit from $908 per unit in fiscal 2011. The year-over-year increase in industry pricing and strong dealer demand contributed to the improved wholesale gross profit per unit. Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. Our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased $67.3 million, or 39%, to $238.8 million from $171.5 million in fiscal 2010. The improvement reflected the 33% increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 4% rise in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit. Wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit increased $39 to $908 per unit from $869 per unit in fiscal 2010. The strength of our wholesale gross profit per unit reflected the strong demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions. Other Gross Profit Other gross profit includes profits related to ESP and GAP revenues, net third-party finance fees and the service department. We have no cost of sales related to ESP and GAP revenues or net third-party finance fees, as these represent commissions paid to us by certain third-party providers, net of the discount associated with the loans purchased by subprime providers. Accordingly, changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition of other gross profit. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. Other gross profit fell $21.0 million, or 10%, to $181.9 million from $203.0 million in fiscal 2011, as the 3% growth in ESP profits was more than offset by lower third-party finance fees and service department profits. The $14.6 million reduction in third-party finance fees reflected the mix shift among providers and the resulting increase in the share of finance contracts purchased by subprime providers, as well as CAF retention of loans that previously had been financed by third-party providers. Service department gross profit declined $12.2 million primarily due to the deleverage associated with increased service overhead costs, the modest retail unit sales growth and lower service retail sales. Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. Other gross profit increased $22.1 million, or 12%, to $203.0 million from $180.8 million in fiscal 2010. ESP and GAP gross profit increased $29.3 million, or 20%, benefiting from the 11% increase in used unit sales, the improved ESP penetration rate and the prior year roll out of the GAP product. Service department gross profit grew $2.9 million, or 8%. The increases in ESP and GAP and service department gross profits were partially offset by a $10.1 million reduction in net third-party finance fees, which were adversely affected by the mix shift among providers. Impact of Inflation Historically, inflation has not been a significant contributor to results. Profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices. However, increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit the SG&A ratio and CAF income, to the extent the average amount financed also increases. During the last three fiscal years, we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing. We believe the appreciation resulted, in part, from the reduced supply of late-model used vehicles in the market that was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle trade-in 27 Table of Contents activity, compared with pre-recession periods. The higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our average selling prices for used and wholesale vehicles. In fiscal 2012, we also experienced inflationary increases in key reconditioning cost components including tires and petroleum-based products. CarMax Auto Finance Income CAF provides financing for a portion of our used and new car retail sales. Because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer ability to obtain on-the-spot financing, it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers. While financing can also be obtained from third-party sources, we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk. Furthermore, we believe that our processes and systems, the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans, both for CAF and for the third-party financing providers. Generally, CAF has provided us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on third-party financing sources. We also believe CAF enables us to capture additional sales. CAF provides financing for qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest. CAF income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, direct CAF expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses. As described in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this MD&A, as of March 1, 2010, we adopted ASU Nos. 2009-16 and 2009-17 on a prospective basis. As a result, the basis on which CAF income was recognized in fiscal 2010 and earlier periods is not directly comparable to the accounting for CAF income in fiscal 2011 and subsequent years.

CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs or income. We present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefits or costs that could be attributed to CAF. Examples of indirect costs not allocated to CAF include retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources, administrative services, marketing, information systems, accounting, legal, treasury and executive payroll. 28 Table of Contents CAF O RIGINATION I NFORMATION Years Ended February 29 or 28 (1) 2012 2011 2010 Net loans originated (in millions) $ 2,842.9 $ 2,147.4 $ 1,836.9 Vehicle units financed 152,468 120,183 109,030 Penetration rate (2) 36.7 % 29.7 % 29.9 % Weighted average contract rate 8.8 % 8.7 % 9.5 % Weighted average term (in months) 65.3 64.5 64.2 (1) All information relates to loans originated net of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns.

CAF average managed receivables increased 10%, to $4.66 billion from $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011. On a net basis (after the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns) CAF financed 37% of retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2012 versus 30% in fiscal 2011. Net loans originated increased 32% to $2.84 billion from $2.15 billion in fiscal 2011, reflecting our decision to retain an increased portion of the loans that third-party providers had been purchasing since CAF tightening of lending standards in fiscal 2010, as well as our 8% growth in retail vehicle revenues. As of January 2012, CAF had transitioned back to retaining all of these loans. Our decision to retain the loans that third parties had been purchasing primarily reflected our confidence in our ability to economically fund these loans. We expect that this decision will be accretive to our earnings over time. CAF income increased 19% to $262.2 million compared with $220.0 million in fiscal 2011. The total interest margin, which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs, was 7.3% of average managed receivables in fiscal 2012 versus 6.7% in fiscal 2011. Interest and fee income grew $29.6 million, largely reflecting the growth in managed receivables. As a percentage of managed receivables, interest and fee income declined modestly to 9.6% from 9.9% in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the effect of the amortization of older loans, partly offset by the shift in the credit quality mix in more recent loan originations. Over the last few years, the average contract rate charged on auto loans has gradually declined, and older loans with higher contract rates have become a smaller portion of total managed receivables. The weighted average contract rate on current loan originations increased slightly to 8.8% in fiscal 2012 from 8.7% in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting our increased retention of higher risk loans during fiscal 2012. Loans with higher risk are generally charged higher rates of interest. See Note 4 for additional information on the credit quality of auto loan receivables. Interest expense declined $27.7 million, despite the growth in managed receivables. The decline reflected the effects of the amortization of older, higher-cost term securitizations and the increasing portion of managed receivables that have been funded with newer, lower-cost securitizations. For the past two years, CAF has benefited from historically low funding costs in the asset-backed securitization market. In a rising interest rate environment, CAF funding costs may rise more rapidly than consumer rates. Should this occur, the compression in CAF interest margin would be recognized over time. The provision for loan losses increased to $36.4 million, or 0.8% of average managed receivables, from $27.7 million, or 0.7% of average managed receivables in fiscal 2011. The increase in the provision primarily reflected the combination of the growth in average managed receivables and the cumulative effect of the origination and retention of loans with higher risk, partly offset by favorable loss experience in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. CAF average managed receivables increased 4% to $4.23 billion from $4.06 billion in fiscal 2010. On a net basis, CAF financed 30% of retail vehicle unit sales in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. Net loans originated increased 17% to $2.15 billion from $1.84 billion in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting our 16% growth in total retail vehicle revenues. CAF reported income of $220.0 million in fiscal 2011. The total interest margin was 6.7% of total average managed receivables, reflecting the wide spreads between interest rates charged to consumers and our related funding costs. CAF portfolio of managed receivables reflected a favorable interest rate environment in which funding costs declined more rapidly than consumer rates. Prior to March 1, 2010, securitization transactions were accounted for as sales. A gain, recorded at the time of securitization, resulted from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables. Other gain included the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous fiscal periods and, changes in the 29 Table of Contents valuation of retained subordinated bonds, as applicable. CAF income also included servicing fee income on securitized receivables and interest income, which included the effective yield on the retained interest, as well as interest income earned on the retained subordinated bonds. Between January 2008 and April 2009, we retained some or all of the subordinated bonds associated with our term securitizations. CAF reported income of $175.2 million in fiscal 2010, including $26.7 million, or $0.07 per share, of net favorable adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal years. The adjustments included $64.0 million of mark-to-market adjustments primarily on the retained subordinated bonds, partially offset by a $56.2 million increase in funding costs related to auto loans originated in prior fiscal years. The gain on loans originated and sold in fiscal 2010 benefited from an increasing spread between consumer rates and CAF funding cost, and the tightening of CAF lending standards in fiscal 2010, which reduced expected net loss and discount rate assumptions used to value the gain income.

(2) Percent of total ending managed receivables as of the corresponding reporting date. The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months. The allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables, historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves. We also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses, recovery rates and the economic environment. The provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance. The allowance for loan losses was 0.9% of ending managed receivables as of both February 29, 2012, and February 28, 2011, as favorable loss experience in the current year largely offset the cumulative effect of originating an increased mix of loans with greater credit risk during fiscal 2012. We expect the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of managed receivables will increase in future years as the higher credit risk loans become a larger percentage of managed receivables.

We believe the improvements were the result of several factors including our credit tightening implemented in fiscal 2010, the strong recovery rates and general industry trends for losses and delinquencies. The average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction. The annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42% to a high of 60%, and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment.

( 2 ) Excludes compensation and benefits related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service, which is included in cost of sales. ( 3 ) Includes IT expenses, insurance, bad debt, travel, preopening and relocation costs, charitable contributions and other administrative expenses. Fiscal 2012 Versus Fiscal 2011. SG&A expenses increased 7% to $940.8 million from $878.8 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in SG&A expense was driven by the expansion of our store base, higher growth-related costs, increases in sales commissions and other variable costs and an increase in advertising expense. Growth-related costs include store pre-opening expenses, relocation expenses, and the costs of maintaining store management bench strength to support future growth. SG&A per used unit rose 4% to $2,305 from $2,218 in fiscal 2011. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales and operating revenues (the SG&A ratio ), fell to 9.4% from 9.8% in fiscal 2011 reflecting the leverage associated with the increases in used and wholesale unit sales, and average selling prices. Fiscal 2011 Versus Fiscal 2010. SG&A expenses increased 11% to $878.8 million from $792.2 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in SG&A was consistent with the increase in used unit sales, and it primarily reflected increases in sales commissions and other variable costs associated with the growth in unit sales and higher advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our resumption of store growth. The increase also reflected the absence of a favorable litigation settlement included in SG&A in the prior year, which increased fiscal 2010 net earnings by $0.02 per diluted share. SG&A per used unit was $2,218 in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. The SG&A ratio improved to 9.8% from 10.6% in fiscal 2010, reflecting the leverage associated with the increases in retail and wholesale unit sales and average selling prices. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.0% in fiscal 2012, 37.9% in fiscal 2011 and 37.8% in fiscal 2010. 31 Table of Contents FISCAL 2013 PLANNED SUPERSTORE OPENINGS Location Television Market Market Status Planned Opening Date Lancaster, Pennsylvania (1) Harrisburg New Q1 fiscal 2013 Bakersfield, California (2) Bakersfield New Q1 fiscal 2013 Nashville, Tennessee Nashville Existing Q2 fiscal 2013 Fort Myers, Florida Fort Myers New Q2 fiscal 2013 Naples, Florida Fort Myers New Q2 fiscal 2013 Oxnard, California Los Angeles Existing Q3 fiscal 2013 Des Moines, Iowa Des Moines New Q3 fiscal 2013 Denver, Colorado (2 stores) Denver New Q3 fiscal 2013 Jackonsville, Florida Jacksonville Existing Q4 fiscal 2013 ( 1) Opened in March 2012.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(Y) for information on recent accounting pronouncements applicable to CarMax. LEASE ACCOUNTING REVISIONS In fiscal 2012, we revised our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to correct our accounting for sale-leaseback transactions entered into between 1995 and 2009. As a result of the revision, we have recorded certain of the assets subject to the sale-leaseback transactions on our consolidated balance sheets in property, plant and equipment and the related sales proceeds as finance lease obligations. Depreciation is being recognized on the assets. Payments on the leases are now recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the obligations, rather than being recognized as rent expense. We have determined that our financial statements were not materially affected by the revision. As a result of the correction, reported net earnings per share were reduced by $0.02 in each of fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. The corrections also increased total assets by $285.6 million and total liabilities by $338.0 million, and reduced total shareholders equity by $52.4 million as of February 28, 2011. Operating cash flows were improved by $10.4 million in fiscal 2011 and $9.2 million in fiscal 2010, and financing cash flows were reduced by equal amounts. See Note 2(K) for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources The combined effects of the adoption of ASU Nos. 2009-16 and 2009-17 and the March 1, 2010, amendment to our then existing warehouse facility agreement represent non-cash transactions, and thus the reported cash flow information for fiscal 2011 takes into account the effect of these and other related reclassifications and adjustments. See Note 2(E) for additional information on the effects of the accounting change. Operating Activities. In fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, net cash used in operating activities totaled $62.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, while in fiscal 2010, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $59.5 million. In fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, these amounts included increases in auto loan receivables of $675.7 million and $304.7 million, respectively. As discussed in Note 2(E), auto loan receivables and the related cash flows were not reported in the consolidated financial statements prior to fiscal 2011. The increase in auto loan receivables primarily reflected the amount by which CAF net loan originations exceeded loan repayments during the applicable year. CAF auto loan receivables are funded through securitization transactions. As a result, the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are reflected as cash provided by financing activities. Inventory totaled $1.09 billion as of the end of fiscal 2012, $1.05 billion as of the end of fiscal 2011 and $843.1 million as of the end of fiscal 2010. The 4% increase in inventory during fiscal 2012 included a 7% increase in used vehicle inventory partially offset by a reduction in new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle inventory reflected the combination of additional used units to support the five stores opened during fiscal 2012 and 32 Table of Contents higher vehicle acquisition costs resulting from the rise in wholesale vehicle valuations. The reduction in new vehicle inventory was primarily due to our termination of a Chrysler franchise in June 2011. The 24% increase in inventory during fiscal 2011 was attributable to the combination of an 18% increase in used vehicle units in inventory and the rise in vehicle acquisition costs. The increase in units reflected the additional vehicles required to support strong sales trends at the end of fiscal 2011, as well as the effect of the three stores opened during that year. We utilize derivative instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the future known receipt or payment of uncertain cash amounts, the values of which are impacted by interest rates. Prior to March 1, 2010, no derivative instruments were designated as accounting hedges, as we believed this treatment was best aligned with our use of gain-on-sale accounting for auto loan receivable securitizations. In conjunction with the adoption of the new accounting rules related to securitizations as of the beginning of fiscal 2011, we now enter into derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, as we believe this treatment is better aligned with our current accounting policies. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $219.4 million in fiscal 2012, $72.2 million in fiscal 2011 and $21.3 million in fiscal 2010. Investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures, which totaled $172.6 million in fiscal 2012, $76.6 million in fiscal 2011 and $22.4 million in fiscal 2010. Capital expenditures include real estate acquisition and store construction costs for planned future store openings. We strive to maintain a multi-year pipeline of store sites to support our store growth, so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores to be opened in subsequent fiscal years. The increases in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 primarily reflected our resumption of store growth in fiscal 2011 and the ramp in planned store openings from 3 stores in fiscal 2011, to 5 stores in fiscal 2012, and 10 stores planned for fiscal 2013, as well as the 10 to 15 stores planned for each of the following 3 fiscal years. In fiscal 2010, capital spending primarily represented expenditures required to maintain our existing structures that were capital in nature; these expenditures were fairly modest because of the relatively young average age of our store base. Historically, capital expenditures have been funded with internally-generated funds, debt and sale-leaseback transactions. No sale-leasebacks were conducted during the last three fiscal years. As of February 29, 2012, we owned 50 and leased 58 of our 108 used car superstores. Restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables increased $43.3 million in fiscal 2012 compared with a $1.6 million decrease in fiscal 2011. These collections vary depending on the timing of the receipt of principal and interest payments on securitized auto loan receivables, the change in average managed receivables and the funding vehicle utilized. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $683.1 million in fiscal 2012 and $101.8 million in fiscal 2011. Included in these amounts were net increases in total non-recourse notes payable of $670.4 million in fiscal 2012 and $187.3 million in fiscal 2011, which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of $675.7 million and $304.7 million, respectively, in auto loan receivables. As discussed in Note 2(E), non-recourse notes payable and the related cash flows were not reported in the consolidated financial statements prior to fiscal 2011. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2011 also included a $121.5 million net reduction in borrowings under the revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2010, net cash used in financing activities totaled $160.5 million, which included a $186.0 million net reduction in borrowings under the revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, the reductions in borrowings under the revolving credit facility reflected the use of excess cash to pay down debt, as well as our relatively low levels of capital spending resulting from our temporary suspension of store growth. 33 Table of Contents T OTAL D EBT AND C ASH AND C ASH E QUIVALENTS As of February 29 or 28 (In millions) 2012 2011 (1) 2010 (1) Non-recourse notes payable $ 4,684.1 $ 4,013.7 $ Borrowings under revolving credit facility 0.9 1.0 122.5 Finance and capital lease obligations 367.7 380.2 389.6 Total debt $ 5,052.7 $ 4,394.9 $ 512.1 Cash and cash equivalents $ 442.7 $ 41.1 $ 18.3 (1) As discussed in Note 2(K), fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 reflect the revisions to correct our accounting for sale-leaseback transactions. We have a $700 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2016. The credit facility contains representations and warranties, conditions and covenants. As of February 29, 2012, we were in compliance with the covenants. Borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and the unused portion is fully available to us. As of February 29, 2012, $0.9 million of short-term debt was outstanding under the credit facility. CAF auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions. Our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles, even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings. Similarly, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables. We do, however, continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles. During fiscal 2012, we completed four term securitizations, funding a total of $2.92 billion of auto loan receivables. As of February 29, 2012, the combined warehouse facility limit was $1.6 billion. At that date, $553.0 million of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facilities and unused warehouse capacity totaled $1.05 billion. Of the combined warehouse facility limit, $800 million will expire in August 2012 and $800 million will expire in February 2013. The securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various financial covenants. As of February 29, 2012, we were in compliance with the financial covenants. See Notes 5 and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities. Finance and capital lease obligations primarily relate to superstores subject to sale-leaseback transactions. Most of these leases had initial terms ranging from 15 to 20 years with additional optional renewal periods ranging from 5 to 20 years. Certain of the leased assets are accounted for using the financing method where the related sales proceeds are recognized as finance obligations and a portion of the periodic lease payments reduce the obligations. The remaining leased assets are accounted for as operating leases. Cash received on equity issuances, which primarily related to employee stock option exercises, totaled $15.6 million in fiscal 2012, $38.3 million in fiscal 2011 and $31.3 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the receipts included exercises prompted by the increase in our stock price during those years. We expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, sale-leaseback transactions and borrowings under existing, new or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund CAF, capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will be able to enter into new, or renew or expand existing, funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs. However, based on conditions in the credit markets, the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements. Fair Value Measurements. We reported money market securities, mutual fund investments, retained interest in securitized receivables and derivative instruments at fair value. See Note 7 for more information on fair value measurements. 34 Table of Contents C ONTRACTUAL O BLIGATIONS As of February 29, 2012 (In millions) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More Than 5 Years Other Revolving credit agreement (1) $ 0.9 $ 0.9 $ $ $ $ Finance and capital leases ( 2) 456.2 46.7 96.0 93.1 220.3 Operating leases (2) 454.0 40.9 79.6 75.1 258.4 Purchase obligations (3) 97.3 85.7 11.6 Asset retirement obligations (4) 1.1 0.2 0.9 Defined benefit retirement plans (5) 67.6 0.4 67.2 Unrecognized tax benefits (6) 18.2 3.1 15.1 Total $ 1,095.3 $ 177.7 $ 187.2 $ 168.4 $ 479.6 $ 82.3 (1) Due to the uncertainty of forecasting expected variable interest rate payments, those amounts are not included in the table.
