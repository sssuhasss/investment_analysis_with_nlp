Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION S You should read the following management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This management discussion and analysis is intended to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Overview Our business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service, and great value. We promote our Pay-TV services as providing our subscribers with a better price-to-value relationship than those available from other subscription television service providers. In connection with the growth in OTT industry, we promote our Sling TV services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services. As the pay-TV industry is mature, our DISH TV strategy has included an increased emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers, even if it means that we will acquire and retain fewer overall subscribers. We evaluate the quality of subscribers based upon a number of factors, including, among others, profitability. Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, this strategy. There can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. Our current revenue and profit is primarily derived from providing Pay-TV services to our subscribers. We also generate revenue from broadband services, equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees, including fees for DVRs, fees for broadband equipment, equipment upgrade fees and additional outlet fees from subscribers with receivers with multiple tuners; advertising services; fees earned from our in-home service operations and sales of digital receivers and related components to third-party pay-TV providers. Our subscriber-related revenue has been declining due to, among other things, the continuing decline in our DISH TV subscriber base. We expect this trend to continue. Our most significant expenses are subscriber-related expenses, which are primarily related to programming, subscriber acquisition costs and depreciation and amortization. Financial Highlights 2017 Consolidated Results of Operations and Key Operating Metrics Revenue of $14.391 billion Net income attributable to DISH Network of $2.099 billion and basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock of $4.50 and $4.07, respectively Loss of approximately 284,000 net Pay-TV subscribers Loss of approximately 995,000 net DISH TV subscribers Addition of approximately 711,000 net Sling TV subscribers Pay-TV ARPU of $86.43 Gross new DISH TV subscriber activations of approximately 1.477 million DISH TV churn rate of 1.78% DISH TV SAC of $751 Consolidated Financial Condition as of December 31, 2017 Cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities of $1.981 billion Total assets of $29.774 billion 63 Table of Contents Total long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $16.203 billion Business Segments We currently operate two primary business segments: (1) Pay-TV and (2) Wireless. Pay-TV We are the nation fourth largest pay-TV provider and offer Pay-TV services under the DISH brand, and the Sling brand. We had 13.242 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States as of December 31, 2017, including 11.030 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.212 million Sling TV subscribers. Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. To differentiate our DISH TV services from our competitors, we introduced the Hopper whole-home DVR during 2012 and have continued to add functionality and simplicity for a more intuitive user experience. Our Hopper and Joey whole-home DVR promotes a suite of integrated features and functionality designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching TV anytime and anywhere. It also has several innovative features that a consumer can use, at his or her option, to watch and record television programming, through their televisions, Internet-connected tablets, smartphones and computers. During the first quarter 2016, we made our next generation Hopper, the Hopper 3, available to customers nationwide. Among other things, the Hopper 3 features 16 tuners, delivers an enhanced 4K Ultra HD experience, and supports up to seven TVs simultaneously. There can be no assurance that these integrated features and functionality will positively affect our results of operations or our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We market our Sling TV services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services. Our Sling TV services require an Internet connection and are available on multiple streaming-capable devices including streaming media devices, TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and smart phones. We offer Sling International, Sling Latino and Sling domestic video programming services. Our domestic Sling TV services have a single-stream service branded Sling Orange and a multi-stream service branded Sling Blue, which includes, among other things, the ability to stream on up to three devices simultaneously. In addition, we have historically offered broadband services under the dishNET brand, which includes satellite broadband services that utilize advanced technology and high-powered satellites launched by Hughes and ViaSat and wireline broadband services. However, as we move our broadband business focus from wholesale to authorized representative arrangements, we are generally no longer marketing dishNET broadband services, and our broadband subscribers will decline through customer attrition. Generally, under these authorized representative arrangements, we will receive certain payments for each broadband service activation generated and installation performed, and we will not incur subscriber acquisition costs for these activations. For example, during the first quarter 2017, we transitioned our wholesale arrangement with Hughes to an authorized representative arrangement and entered into a MSA with HNS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hughes. See Hughes Broadband Master Services Agreement in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K on our Related Party Transactions with EchoStar for further information. As a result of the completion of the Share Exchange with EchoStar, described below, we also design, develop and distribute receiver systems and provide digital broadcast operations, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, transmission and other services to third-party pay-TV providers. Share Exchange Agreement On February 28, 2017, we and EchoStar and certain of our respective subsidiaries completed the Share Exchange pursuant to which EchoStar transferred to us the Transferred Businesses and in exchange, we transferred to EchoStar the Tracking Stock, that tracked the residential retail satellite broadband business of HNS. In connection with the Share Exchange, we and EchoStar and certain of its subsidiaries entered into certain agreements covering, among other things, tax matters, employee matters, intellectual property matters and the provision of transitional services. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K on our Related Party Transactions with EchoStar for further information. 64 Table of Contents As the Share Exchange was a transaction between entities that are under common control accounting rules require that our Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of the Transferred Businesses for all periods presented, including periods prior to the completion of the Share Exchange. We initially recorded the Transferred Businesses at EchoStar historical cost basis. The difference between the historical cost basis of the Transferred Businesses and the net carrying value of the Tracking Stock is recorded in Additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The results of the Transferred Businesses were prepared from separate records maintained by EchoStar for the periods prior to March 1, 2017, and may not necessarily be indicative of the conditions that would have existed, or the results of operations, if the Transferred Businesses had been operated on a combined basis with our subsidiaries. Our consolidated financial statements include the results of the Transferred Businesses as described above for all periods presented, including periods prior to the completion of the Share Exchange. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Wireless Since 2008, we have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets and made over $10 billion in non-controlling investments in certain entities, for a total of over $21 billion, as described further below. DISH Network Spectrum We have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. These wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we consider our options for the commercialization of our wireless spectrum, we will incur significant additional expenses and will have to make significant investments related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and wireless network infrastructure. In March 2017, we notified the FCC that we plan to deploy a next-generation 5G-capable network, focused on supporting narrowband IoT. The first phase of our network deployment will be completed by March 2020, with subsequent phases to be completed thereafter. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless DISH Network Spectrum in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 65 Table of Contents DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American II and American III, we have made over $10 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, the parent company of Northstar Wireless, and in SNR HoldCo, the parent company of SNR Wireless, respectively. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 Licenses to Northstar Wireless and to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in FCC authorizations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the applicable accounting guidance in ASC 810, Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we consolidate these entities into our financial statements. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. We may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and to the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate these AWS-3 Licenses, comply with regulations applicable to such AWS-3 Licenses, and make any potential payments related to the Northstar Re-Auction Payment and the SNR Re-Auction Payment for the AWS-3 Licenses retained by the FCC. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, regulatory compliance, and potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to develop and implement business models that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Trends in our Pay-TV Segment Competition Competition has intensified in recent years as the pay-TV industry has matured. With respect to our DISH TV services, we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV subscribers, mostly as a result of upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers and by providing retention credits. Our DISH TV subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period. Many of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers, including bundled offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other promotional offers. Certain competitors have been able to subsidize the price of video services with the price of broadband and/or wireless services. In addition, our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and net DISH TV subscriber additions continue to be negatively impacted by stricter customer acquisition and retention policies for our DISH TV subscribers, including an increased emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. Our Pay-TV services also face increased competition from programmers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet. Our Sling TV services face increased competition from content providers and other companies, as well as traditional satellite television providers, cable companies and large telecommunication companies, that are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. Competition from video content distributed over the Internet includes services with live linear television programming, single programmer offerings and offerings of large libraries of on-demand content, including in many cases original content. Furthermore, our DISH TV services face increased competition as programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent and consumers are spending an increasing amount of time accessing video content via the Internet on their mobile devices. Significant changes in 66 Table of Contents consumer behavior with regard to the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband-connected device they choose. Online content providers may cause our subscribers to disconnect our DISH TV services ( cord cutting ), downgrade to smaller, less expensive programming packages ( cord shaving ) or elect to purchase through these online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay per view movies, resulting in less revenue to us. We implement new marketing promotions from time to time that are intended to increase our Pay-TV subscriber activations. For our DISH TV services, we have launched various marketing promotions offering certain DISH TV programming packages without a price increase for a commitment period. We also launched our Flex Pack skinny bundle with a core package of programming consisting of more than 50 channels and the choice of one of nine themed add-on channel packs, which include, among others, local broadcast networks and kids and general entertainment programming. Subscribers can also add or remove additional channel packs to best suit their entertainment needs. During 2017, we launched Tuned In To You and the accompanying Spokeslistener campaign. While we plan to implement these and other new marketing efforts for our DISH TV services, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in increasing our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. Additionally, in response to our efforts, we may face increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing and retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. For our Sling TV services, we offer a personalized TV experience with a customized channel line-up and two of the lowest priced live-linear online streaming services in the industry, our Sling Orange service and our Sling Blue service. During 2017, we launched our A la carte TV campaign. While we plan to implement these and other new marketing efforts for our Sling TV services, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in increasing our net Sling TV subscriber activations. Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining due to, among other things, the factors described above. There can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. As our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it could have a material adverse long-term effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Programming Our ability to compete successfully will depend, among other things, on our ability to continue to obtain desirable programming and deliver it to our subscribers at competitive prices. Programming costs represent a large percentage of our Subscriber-related expenses and the largest component of our total expense. We expect these costs to continue to increase, and certain programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation, especially for local broadcast channels. The rates we are charged for retransmitting local broadcast channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our customers. In addition, programming costs continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. Going forward, our margins may face pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on acceptable pricing and other economic terms or if we are unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our customers. Increases in programming costs have caused us to increase the rates that we charge to our subscribers, which could in turn cause our existing Pay-TV subscribers to disconnect our service or cause potential new Pay-TV subscribers to choose not to subscribe to our service. Additionally, even if our subscribers do not disconnect our services, they may purchase through new and existing online content providers a certain portion of the services that they would have historically purchased from us, such as pay-per-view movies, resulting in less revenue to us. Furthermore, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming carriage contracts before they expire. In the past, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. We cannot predict 67 Table of Contents with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. Operations and Customer Service While competitive factors have impacted the entire pay-TV industry, our relative performance has also been driven by issues specific to us. In the past, our subscriber growth has been adversely affected by signal theft and other forms of fraud and by our operational inefficiencies. For our DISH TV services, in order to combat signal theft and improve the security of our broadcast system, we use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or security chips in our DBS receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content ( Security Access Devices ). We expect that future replacements of these devices may be necessary to keep our system secure. To combat other forms of fraud, among other things, we monitor our independent third-party distributors and independent third-party retailers adherence to our business rules. Furthermore, for our Sling TV services, we encrypt programming content and use digital rights management software to, among other things, prevent unauthorized access to our programming content. While we have made improvements in responding to and dealing with customer service issues, we continue to focus on the prevention of these issues, which is critical to our business, financial condition and results of operations. To improve our operational performance, we continue to make investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center and in-home service operations. These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, increase productivity, and allow us to scale better over the long run. We cannot be certain, however, that our spending will ultimately be successful in improving our operational performance. Changes in our Technology We have been deploying DBS receivers for our DISH TV services that utilize 8PSK modulation technology with MPEG-4 compression technology for several years. These technologies, when fully deployed, will allow improved broadcast efficiency, and therefore allow increased programming capacity. Many of our customers today, however, do not have DBS receivers that use MPEG-4 compression technology. In addition, given that all of our HD content is broadcast in MPEG-4, any growth in HD penetration will naturally accelerate our transition to these newer technologies and may increase our retention costs. All new DBS receivers have MPEG-4 compression with 8PSK modulation technology. In addition, from time to time, we change equipment for certain subscribers to make more efficient use of transponder capacity in support of HD and other initiatives. We believe that the benefit from the increase in available transponder capacity outweighs the short-term cost of these equipment changes. EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS While we continue to focus on the financial performance of our Pay-TV segment as a whole, beginning in the fourth quarter 2017, we are electing to separately disclose Sling TV and DISH TV subscribers. We report Sling TV subscribers acquired net of disconnects. In addition, we are now reporting gross new subscriber additions, SAC, and the churn rate for our DISH TV subscribers on a stand-alone basis. All prior period subscriber information and key metrics have been conformed to the current period presentation. The following table details our recast metrics by quarter for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The effect of the removal of these 145,000 subscribers as of September 30, 2017 was excluded from the calculation of our net DISH TV subscriber additions/losses and DISH TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Results of Operations Pay-TV subscribers for further information. Subscriber-related revenue . Subscriber-related revenue consists principally of revenue from basic, premium movie, local, HD programming, pay-per-view, Latino and international subscriptions; broadband services; equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees, including fees for DVRs, fees for broadband equipment, equipment upgrade fees and additional outlet fees; advertising services; fees earned from our in-home service operations and other subscriber revenue. Certain of the amounts included in Subscriber-related revenue are not recurring on a monthly basis. Equipment sales and other revenue . Equipment sales and other revenue principally includes the non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distributors of our equipment, sales of digital receivers and related components to third-party pay-TV providers and revenue from services and other agreements with EchoStar. Subscriber-related expenses . Subscriber-related expenses principally include programming expenses, which represent a substantial majority of these expenses. Subscriber-related expenses also include costs for Pay-TV and broadband services incurred in connection with our in-home service and call center operations, billing costs, refurbishment and repair costs related to DBS receiver systems and broadband equipment, subscriber retention, other variable subscriber expenses and monthly wholesale fees paid to broadband providers. Satellite and transmission expenses . Satellite and transmission expenses includes the cost of leasing satellite and transponder capacity from EchoStar and the cost of telemetry, tracking and control and other professional services provided to us by EchoStar. Satellite and transmission expenses also includes the cost of digital broadcast operations, executory costs associated with capital leases and costs associated with transponder leases and other related services. In addition, Satellite and transmission expenses includes costs associated with our Sling TV services including, among other things, streaming delivery technology and infrastructure. Cost of sales - equipment and other. Cost of sales - equipment and other primarily includes the cost of non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distributors of our equipment, costs associated with sales of digital receivers and related components to third-party pay-TV providers and costs related to services and other agreements with EchoStar. Subscriber acquisition costs . While we primarily lease DBS receiver systems and broadband modem equipment, we also subsidize certain costs to attract new subscribers. Our Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of subsidized sales of DBS receiver systems to independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distributors of our equipment, the cost of subsidized sales of DBS receiver systems directly by us to subscribers, including net costs related to our promotional incentives, costs related to our direct sales efforts and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising. Our Subscriber acquisition costs also includes costs associated with acquiring Sling TV subscribers including, among other things, costs related to acquisition advertising, our direct sales efforts and commissions. DISH TV SAC. Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating traditional companies in the pay-TV industry. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new DISH TV subscriber activation, or DISH TV SAC, and we believe presentations of pay-TV SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. Our DISH TV SAC is calculated as Subscriber acquisition costs, excluding Subscriber acquisition costs associated with our broadband services and Sling TV services, plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers, divided by gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We include all the costs of acquiring DISH TV subscribers (e.g., subsidized and capitalized equipment) as we believe it is a more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire subscribers. We also include all new DISH TV subscribers in our calculation, including DISH TV subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs. 69 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, and accounting and finance. It also includes outside professional fees (e.g., legal, information systems and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration. Litigation expense. Litigation expense primarily consists of certain significant legal settlements, judgments and/or accruals. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized primarily includes interest expense (net of capitalized interest), prepayment premiums, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt, and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our capitalized interest policy. Other, net. The main components of Other, net are gains and losses realized on the sale and/or conversion of marketable and non-marketable investment securities and derivative financial instruments, impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable investment securities accounted for as trading securities and derivative financial instruments, and equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ). EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network plus Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized net of Interest income, Income tax (provision) benefit, net and Depreciation and amortization. This non-GAAP measure is reconciled to Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network in our discussion of Results of Operations below. DISH TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, independent third-party retailers and other independent third-party distribution relationships in our DISH TV subscriber count. We also provide DISH TV services to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately equal to the retail price of our Flex Pack programming package, and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH TV subscriber count. Sling TV subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales and third-party marketing agreements in our Sling TV subscriber count. Sling TV subscribers are recorded net of disconnects. Sling TV customers receiving service for no charge, under certain new subscriber promotions, are excluded from our Sling TV subscriber count. For customers who subscribe to multiple Sling TV packages, including, among others, Sling TV Blue, Sling TV Orange and Sling Latino, each customer is only counted as one Sling TV subscriber. Pay-TV subscribers. Our Pay-TV subscriber count includes all DISH TV and Sling TV subscribers discussed above. For customers who subscribe to both our DISH TV services and our Sling TV services, each subscription is counted as a separate Pay-TV subscriber. Pay-TV average monthly revenue per subscriber ( Pay-TV ARPU ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate Pay-TV average monthly revenue per Pay-TV subscriber, or Pay-TV ARPU, by dividing average monthly Subscriber-related revenue, excluding revenue from broadband services, for the period by our average number of Pay-TV subscribers for the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of Pay-TV subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending Pay-TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Sling TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, as Sling TV subscribers increase, it has had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU. DISH TV average monthly subscriber churn rate ( DISH TV churn rate ). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated 70 Table of Contents consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate DISH TV churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH TV subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average number of DISH TV subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers is calculated for the period by adding the average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. The average number of DISH TV subscribers for each month is calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH TV subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Free cash flow . We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment and Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 71 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016.

The effect of the removal of these 145,000 subscribers as of September 30, 2017 was excluded from the calculation of our net DISH TV subscriber additions/losses and DISH TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Results of Operations Pay-TV subscribers for further information. 72 Table of Contents Pay-TV subscribers . We lost approximately 284,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the loss of approximately 392,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2016. The decrease in net Pay-TV subscriber losses during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from fewer net DISH TV subscriber losses, partially offset by fewer net Sling TV subscriber additions. We lost approximately 995,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the loss of approximately 1.270 million net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2016. This decrease in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from a lower DISH TV churn rate, partially offset by lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We added approximately 711,000 net Sling TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the addition of approximately 878,000 net Sling TV subscribers during the same period in 2016. This decrease in net Sling TV subscriber additions is primarily related to a higher number of customer disconnects on a larger Sling TV subscriber base and from increased competition, including competition from other OTT service providers. Our DISH TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.78% compared to 1.97% for the same period in 2016. This decrease primarily resulted from our increased emphasis on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers. See below for discussion regarding the impacts of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands during September 2017. While our DISH TV churn rate improved during the year ended December 31, 2017, it continues to be adversely affected by increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, as well as cord cutting. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by, among other things, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we activated approximately 1.477 million gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 1.736 million gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2016, a decrease of 14.9%. This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily impacted by increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing and retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, as well as stricter customer acquisition policies for our DISH TV subscribers, including an increased emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers. During September 2017, Hurricane Maria caused extraordinary damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, resulting in a widespread loss of power and infrastructure. Given the devastation and loss of power, substantially all customers in those areas were unable to receive our service as of September 30, 2017. In an effort to ensure customers would not be charged for services they were unable to receive, we proactively paused service for those customers. Accordingly, we removed approximately 145,000 subscribers, representing all of our subscribers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, from our ending Pay-TV subscriber count as of September 30, 2017. The effect of the removal of these 145,000 subscribers as of September 30, 2017 was excluded from the calculation of our net DISH TV subscriber additions/losses and DISH TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarter 2017, 75,000 of these customers reactivated. We incurred certain costs in connection with the re-activation of these returning subscribers, and accordingly, these returning customers were recorded as gross new DISH TV subscriber activations for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the corresponding costs recorded in Subscriber acquisition costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and/or in Purchases of property and equipment in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We cannot predict when the remaining subscribers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands discussed above will be able to receive service, how many will return or when they may return to active subscriber status, and there can be no assurance that they will return. Although we continue to assess the potential impact of Hurricane Maria on our subscriber base, the impact of the hurricane did not have a material effect on our overall financial position or results of operations. In the past, our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV subscriber churn rate have been negatively impacted as a result of programming interruptions and threatened programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of programming carriage contracts with content providers. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact to our net Pay-TV subscriber additions, gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, and DISH TV subscriber churn rate resulting from programming interruptions or threatened programming 73 Table of Contents interruptions that may occur in the future. As a result, we may at times suffer from periods of lower net Pay-TV subscriber additions or higher net Pay-TV subscriber losses. We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment, and aligning the interests of certain independent third-party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service. Most of these factors have affected both gross new DISH TV subscriber activations as well as DISH TV subscriber churn rate. Our future gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and our DISH TV subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue. Subscriber-related revenue. Subscriber-related revenue totaled $14.260 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $774 million or 5.1% compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in Subscriber-related revenue from the same period in 2016 was primarily related to the decrease in Pay-TV ARPU discussed below and a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base. We expect these trends in Subscriber-related revenue to continue. Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was $86.43 during the year ended December 31, 2017 versus $88.66 during the same period in 2016. The $2.23 or 2.5% decrease in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to an increase in Sling TV subscribers as a percentage of our total Pay-TV subscriber base and a shift in DISH TV programming package mix to lower priced programming packages. Sling TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, the increase in Sling TV subscribers had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU. We expect this trend to continue. These decreases were partially offset by DISH TV programming package price increases in February 2017 and 2016 and an increase in Sling TV subscribers with higher priced Sling TV programming packages. Subscriber-related expenses. Subscriber-related expenses totaled $8.920 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $6 million or 0.1% compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in Subscriber-related expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming costs per subscriber, partially offset by a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base and a decrease in variable costs per subscriber. The increase in programming costs per subscriber was driven by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. Subscriber-related expenses represented 62.6% and 59.3% of Subscriber-related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from lower subscriber-related revenue and higher programming costs, discussed above. In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. Our Subscriber-related expenses have and will continue to face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. In addition, our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.204 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $252 million or 17.3% compared to the same period in 2016. This change was primarily attributable to fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in DISH TV SAC, discussed below. DISH TV SAC. DISH TV SAC was $751 during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $832 during the same period in 2016, a decrease of $81 or 9.7%. This change was primarily attributable to a decrease in hardware costs per activation, a decrease in advertising costs per activation and the reactivation of subscribers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in fourth quarter 2017. The expenses we incurred for the reactivation of subscribers in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were lower on a per subscriber basis than those incurred for the remaining gross new DISH TV activations during the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in hardware costs per activation was primarily due to a reduction in manufacturing costs related to certain receiver systems and a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new DISH TV subscriber accounts. 74 Table of Contents During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled $137 million and $243 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers resulted primarily from fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in hardware costs per activation, discussed above. To remain competitive, we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the DISH TV SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Our Subscriber acquisition costs and DISH TV SAC may materially increase in the future to the extent that we, among other things, transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies. See further information under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs. Litigation expense. Litigation expense related to certain significant legal settlements, judgments and/or accruals totaled $296 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $275 million compared to the same period in 2016. See Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $818 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, a $104 million or 11.3% decrease compared to the same period in 2016. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation expense from equipment leased to new and existing DISH TV subscribers, partially offset by the increase in depreciation expense associated with our EchoStar XVIII satellite, which became operational during the third quarter 2016. Impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets of $146 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from an impairment of the T1 satellite. See Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized totaled $63 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $10 million or 18.9% compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily related to interest expense associated with debt issuances during 2016 and 2017, partially offset by an increase of $172 million in capitalized interest principally associated with the commercialization of our wireless spectrum and a reduction in interest expense from debt redemptions during 2016 and 2017. On June 14, 2017, the FCC issued an order granting our application to acquire the 600 MHz Licenses. The addition of the carrying amount of these licenses, together with the carrying amount of current wireless spectrum licenses, exceeded the amount of long-term debt and capital lease obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets since June 14, 2017. Therefore, beginning June 14, 2017, materially all of our interest expense is being capitalized. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization . EBITDA was $2.423 billion during the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $884 million or 26.7% compared to the same period in 2016. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by Litigation expense of $296 million and Impairment of long-lived assets of $146 million. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements. For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,423,099 $ 3,306,932 Interest, net (22,166) (21,973) Income tax (provision) benefit, net 515,320 (865,818) Depreciation and amortization (817,564) (921,202) Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network $ 2,098,689 $ 1,497,939 75 Table of Contents EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax (provision) benefit, net . Our income tax benefit was $515 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to an income tax provision of $866 million for the same period in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was enacted, which, among other things, lowered the federal statutory corporate tax rate effective for us in future periods from 35% to 21%. Consequently, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 which positively impacted our Income tax (provision) benefit, net by approximately $1.2 billion. Our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by $255 million of Litigation expense related to the FTC Action during the year ended December 31, 2017, as any eventual payments of this expense may not be deductible for income tax purposes. The tax deductibility of any eventual payments may change based upon, among other things, further developments in the FTC Action, including final adjudication of the FTC Action.

We lost approximately 392,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the loss of approximately 81,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2015. The increase in net Pay-TV subscriber losses during the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from higher net DISH TV subscriber losses, partially offset by higher net Sling TV subscriber additions. We lost approximately 1.270 million net DISH TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the loss of approximately 607,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2015. This increase primarily resulted from a higher DISH TV churn rate and lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We added approximately 878,000 net Sling TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the addition of approximately 526,000 net Sling TV subscribers during the same period in 2015. This increase in net Sling TV subscriber additions primarily resulted from the launch of our Sling Blue service in 2016. Our DISH TV churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 1.97% compared to 1.75% for the same period in 2015. Our DISH TV churn rate continues to be adversely affected by increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers, as well as cord cutting. Our DISH TV churn rate is also impacted by, among other things, the credit quality of previously acquired subscribers, our ability to consistently provide outstanding customer service, price increases, programming interruptions in connection with the scheduled expiration of certain programming carriage contracts, our ability to control piracy and other forms of fraud and the level of our retention efforts. As part of our increased emphasis on retaining higher quality subscribers, we have been more selective in issuing retention credits, which has had a negative impact on our DISH TV churn rate. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we activated approximately 1.736 million gross new DISH TV subscribers compared to approximately 2.247 million gross new DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2015, a decrease of 22.7%. This decrease in our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations was primarily impacted by stricter customer acquisition policies for our DISH TV subscribers, including an increased emphasis on acquiring higher quality subscribers, as well as increased competitive pressures, including aggressive marketing, more aggressive retention efforts, bundled discount offers combining broadband, video and/or wireless services and other discounted promotional offers. In addition, our ending Pay-TV subscriber count increased by approximately 166,000 subscribers during the third quarter 2016 as a result of the change in our calculation for our commercial accounts. This had no impact on our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations or net Pay-TV subscriber losses for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Explanation of Key Metrics and Other Items Pay-TV subscribers for further information. Subscriber-related revenue. Subscriber-related revenue totaled $15.034 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $80 million or 0.5% compared to the same period in 2015. The change in Subscriber-related revenue from the same period in 2015 was primarily related to the increase in Pay TV ARPU discussed below, partially offset by a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base. Pay-TV ARPU. Pay-TV ARPU was $88.66 during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus $86.79 during the same period in 2015. The $1.87 or 2.2% increase in Pay-TV ARPU was primarily attributable to the DISH TV programming package price increases in February 2016 and 2015. These price increases were partially offset by a shift in DISH TV programming package mix and an increase in Sling TV subscribers. Sling TV subscribers on average purchase lower priced programming services than DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, the increase in Sling -TV subscribers during 2016 had a negative impact on Pay-TV ARPU. We expect this trend to continue. Subscriber-related expenses. Subscriber-related expenses totaled $8.914 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $92 million or 1.0% compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in Subscriber-related expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming costs per subscriber, partially offset by a lower average Pay-TV subscriber base. The increase in programming costs per subscriber was driven by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates, particularly for local broadcast channels. Subscriber-related expenses represented 59.3% and 59.0% of Subscriber-related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from higher programming costs, discussed above. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.456 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $208 million or 12.5% compared to the same period in 2015. This change was primarily attributable to fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. 78 Table of Contents DISH TV SAC. DISH TV SAC was $832 during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $822 during the same period in 2015, an increase of $10 or 1.2%. This change was primarily attributable to an increase in advertising costs per activation, partially offset by a decrease in hardware costs per activation. The decrease in hardware costs per activation was primarily due to a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers being activated on new DISH TV subscriber accounts and a reduction in manufacturing costs related to certain receiver systems. This decrease in hardware costs was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of new DISH TV subscriber activations with Hopper 3 receiver systems, which have a higher cost per unit than the prior generation Hopper receiver systems. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers totaled $243 million and $371 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new DISH TV subscribers resulted primarily from fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in hardware costs per activation, discussed above. FCC auction expense. On October 1, 2015, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless notified the FCC that they would not be paying the gross winning bid amounts on certain AWS-3 Licenses. As a result, the FCC retained those AWS-3 Licenses and Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless paid the FCC an additional interim payment of approximately $516 million. See Note 14 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets of $126 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from an impairment of the D1 satellite and related ground equipment. See Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized totaled $53 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $441 million or 89.2% compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily related to an increase of $474 million in capitalized interest principally associated with wireless spectrum and a reduction in interest expense as a result of redemptions and repurchases of debt during 2016 and 2015, partially offset by interest expense associated with the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2026 and our 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2026. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 Licenses to Northstar Wireless and to SNR Wireless, respectively. We began capitalizing interest expense related to the commercialization of these wireless spectrum licenses in the fourth quarter 2015. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Other, net. Other, net income was $119 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $162 million or 57.6% compared to the same period in 2015. This change resulted from a decrease in net realized and/or unrealized gains on our derivative financial instruments, partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on our marketable investment securities. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization . EBITDA was $3.307 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $673 million or 25.6% compared to the same period in 2015. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was positively impacted by Other, net income of $119 million. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 was negatively impacted by the FCC auction expense of $516 million and Impairment of long-lived assets of $126 million, partially offset by the positive impact of Other, net income of $281 million. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements. For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 3,306,932 $ 2,633,456 Interest, net (21,973) (474,555) Income tax (provision) benefit, net (865,818) (393,170) Depreciation and amortization (921,202) (963,357) Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network $ 1,497,939 $ 802,374 79 Table of Contents EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax (provision) benefit, net . Our income tax provision was $866 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $473 million compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the provision was primarily related to the increase in Income (loss) before income taxes and an increase in our effective tax rate. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our effective tax rate was positively impacted by a $63 million credit that was previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and was released to our income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 5 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment Securities We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Note 6 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities totaled $1.981 billion compared to $5.360 billion as of December 31, 2016, a decrease of $3.379 billion. This decrease in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities primarily resulted from a $4.711 billion payment to the FCC for the 600 MHz Licenses, the redemption of our 4 5/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $900 million, $174 million repurchases of our 4 1/4% Senior Notes due 2018 in open market trades and capital expenditures of $1.385 billion (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations), partially offset by approximately $994 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our Convertible Notes due 2024 and cash generated from operating activities of $2.780 billion. Debt Maturity Our 7 1/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $1.5 billion were redeemed on February 1, 2016. Our 4 5/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $900 million were redeemed on July 17, 2017. During 2017, we repurchased $174 million of our 4 1/4% Senior Notes due 2018 in open market trades. The remaining balance of $1.026 billion matures on April 1, 2018 and is included in Current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. We expect to fund the remaining obligation from cash and marketable investment securities balances at that time. But, depending on market conditions, we may refinance the remaining obligation in whole or in part. Cash Flow The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base, expand our infrastructure, make strategic investments, such as significant investments in wireless, including commercialization of our wireless spectrum, and repay debt obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we reported Net cash flows from operating activities of $2.780 billion, $2.854 billion and $2.459 billion, respectively. Net cash flows from operating activities from 2016 to 2017 decreased $74 million, primarily attributable to a $317 million decrease in income adjusted to exclude non-cash charges for Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments, Depreciation and amortization expense, Impairment of long-lived assets and Deferred tax expense (benefit), partially offset by an increase in cash flows resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities principally attributable to timing differences between book expense and cash payments. 80 Table of Contents Net cash flows from operating activities from 2015 to 2016 increased $395 million, primarily attributable to a $987 million increase in income adjusted to exclude non-cash charges for Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments, Depreciation and amortization expense, Impairment of long-lived assets and Deferred tax expense (benefit), partially offset by a decrease in cash flows resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities principally attributable to timing differences between book expense and cash payments, including income taxes. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities, acquisitions, strategic investments, including purchases and settlements of derivative financial instruments, and purchases of wireless spectrum licenses, capital expenditures and capitalized interest. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we reported outflows from Net cash flows from investing activities of $6.521 billion, $1.738 billion and $8.062 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, capital expenditures for new and existing DISH TV customer equipment totaled $259 million, $387 million and $496 million, respectively. The decrease in 2017 for new and existing DISH TV customer equipment primarily resulted from fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations and a decrease in hardware costs per activation. The year ended December 31, 2017 was impacted by cash outflows primarily related to a $4.711 billion payment to the FCC for the 600 MHz Licenses, $953 million of capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations, $432 million of capital expenditures and $360 million in net purchases of marketable investment securities. The year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by cash outflows primarily related to the upfront payment related to Auction 1000 of $1.5 billion, $724 million of capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations, $614 million of capital expenditures and cash inflows related to a $562 million settlement of our derivative financial instruments and $524 million in net sales of marketable investment securities. The year ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by cash outflows associated with our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities related to the AWS-3 Licenses of $8.970 billion, $735 million of capital expenditures, $353 million of capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations, cash inflows related to net sales of marketable investment securities of $1.607 billion and a refund from the FCC of our $400 million upfront payment related to the AWS-3 Auction in 2015. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long-term and convertible debt, cash used for the repurchase, redemption or payment of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, and repurchases of our Class A common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported outflows from Net cash flows from financing activities of $103 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported inflows from Net cash flows from financing activities of $3.154 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported outflows from Net cash flows from financing activities of $448 million. The net cash outflows in 2017 primarily related to the redemption of our 4 5/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $900 million and the $174 million repurchases of our 4 1/4% Senior Notes due 2018 in open market trades, partially offset by approximately $994 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes due 2024. The net cash inflows in 2016 primarily related to $4.973 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2026 and the Convertible Notes due 2026, partially offset by the redemption of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $1.5 billion and $260 million in net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The net cash outflows in 2015 primarily related to the redemption of our 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2015 of $650 million, partially offset by $204 million in aggregate capital contributions to Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo from Northstar Manager and SNR Management, respectively. 81 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, and Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments (including strategic wireless investments), fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. Free cash flow can be significantly impacted from period to period by changes in Net income (loss) adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges, operating assets and liabilities, Purchases of property and equipment, and Capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations. These items are shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities and Net cash flows from investing activities sections on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, management timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, net Pay-TV subscriber additions (losses), subscriber revenue, DISH TV subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition and retention costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs for DISH TV subscribers, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment, expenditures related to the commercialization of our wireless spectrum and other factors. In addition, certain changes resulting from the Tax Reform Act, including, among other things, limitations on the deductibility of interest, may increase cash paid for income taxes and decrease free cash flow in 2018. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In thousands) Free cash flow $ 1,394,214 $ 1,515,863 $ 1,371,442 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment (including capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations) 1,385,293 1,338,384 1,087,681 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,779,507 $ 2,854,247 $ 2,459,123 Operational Liquidity We make general investments in property such as satellites, set-top boxes, information technology and facilities that support our overall Pay-TV business. We also will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate our wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. Moreover, since we are primarily a subscriber-based company, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary. Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment. Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive, but there can be no assurances that over time we will recoup or earn a return on the upfront investment. 82 Table of Contents There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time. The first factor is our DISH TV churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current Pay-TV subscribers. To the extent we lose Pay-TV subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced. The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our subscriber-related margins. To the extent our Subscriber-related expenses grow faster than our Subscriber-related revenue, the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced. Recently, our subscriber-related margins have been reduced by, among other things, a shift to lower priced Pay-TV programming packages and higher programming costs. The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers. The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with acquiring new subscribers. Conversely, the slower we acquire subscribers, the more our operating cash flow is enhanced in that period. Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by the rate at which we make general investments (including significant investments in wireless), incur expenditures related to the commercialization of our wireless licenses (including any expenditures associated with the deployment of our wireless networks), incur litigation expense, and any cash flow from financing activities. Our subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers have a significant impact on our cash flow. While fewer subscribers will likely translate into lower ongoing cash flow in the long-term, cash flow is actually aided, in the short-term, by the reduction in subscriber-specific investment spending. As a result, a slow-down in our business due to external or internal factors does not introduce the same level of short-term liquidity risk as it might in other industries. Subscriber Base We lost approximately 284,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the loss of approximately 392,000 net Pay-TV subscribers during the same period in 2016. The decrease in net Pay-TV subscriber losses during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from fewer net DISH TV subscriber losses, partially offset by fewer net Sling TV subscriber additions. We lost approximately 995,000 net DISH TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the loss of approximately 1.270 million net DISH TV subscribers during the same period in 2016. This decrease in net DISH TV subscriber losses primarily resulted from a lower DISH TV churn rate, partially offset by lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations. We added approximately 711,000 net Sling TV subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the addition of approximately 878,000 net Sling TV subscribers during the same period in 2016. This decrease in net Sling TV subscriber additions is primarily related to a higher number of customer disconnects on a larger Sling TV subscriber base and from increased competition, including competition from other OTT service providers. See Results of Operations above for further information. Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs We incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers, including advertising, independent third-party retailer incentives, payments made to third-parties, equipment subsidies, installation services, and/or new customer promotions. While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective. With respect to our DISH TV services, we employ business rules such as minimum credit requirements for prospective customers and contractual commitments to receive service for a minimum term. We strive to provide outstanding customer service to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their Pay-TV services over longer periods of time. Subscriber acquisition costs for Sling TV subscribers are significantly lower than those for DISH TV subscribers, and therefore, as Sling TV subscriber activations increase, it will have a positive impact on subscriber acquisition costs. Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period. We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV customers, mostly by upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers and by providing retention credits. As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention upgrade spending includes the cost of equipment and installation services. In certain circumstances, we also offer programming at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing for limited periods to existing customers in exchange for a contractual commitment to receive service for a minimum term. A component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move. Our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period. 83 Table of Contents Seasonality Historically, the first half of the year generally produces fewer gross new DISH TV subscriber activations than the second half of the year, as is typical in the pay-TV industry. In addition, the first and fourth quarters generally produce a lower DISH TV churn rate than the second and third quarters. However, in recent years, as the pay-TV industry has matured we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. As a result, seasonality has recently had a smaller impact on gross new DISH TV subscribers and the DISH TV churn rate. However, we cannot provide assurance that this will continue in the future. Our net Sling TV subscriber additions are impacted by, among other things, certain major sporting events and other major television events. We expect our new Sling TV subscriber additions to potentially demonstrate seasonality patterns as our Sling TV services become more established. We expect to be able to assess the seasonality patterns once we have a longer subscriber history. Satellites Operation of our DISH TV services requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming that we offer. Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity. Security Systems Increases in theft of our signal or our competitors signals could, in addition to reducing gross new subscriber activations, also cause subscriber churn to increase. We use Security Access Devices in our DBS receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Furthermore, for our Sling TV services, we encrypt programming content and use digital rights management software to, among other things, prevent unauthorized access to our programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult. It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft. We expect that future replacements of Security Access Devices may be necessary to keep our system secure. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system security is compromised. Stock Repurchases Our Board of Directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock through and including December 31, 2017. On November 2, 2017, our Board of Directors extended this authorization such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock through and including December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Class A common stock under this program. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no repurchases of our Class A common stock. Covenants and Restrictions Related to our Long-Term Debt We are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures related to our long-term debt. In particular, the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes issued by DISH DBS Corporation ( DISH DBS ) contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on the ability of DISH DBS and its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (iii) pay dividends or 84 Table of Contents make distributions on DISH DBS capital stock or repurchase DISH DBS capital stock; (iv) make certain investments; (v) create liens; (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) merge or consolidate with another company; and (viii) transfer or sell assets. Should we fail to comply with these covenants, all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes and our other long-term debt could become immediately payable. The senior notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change-in-control events occur. In addition, the Convertible Notes due 2026 and Convertible Notes due 2024 provide that, if a fundamental change (as defined in the related indenture) occurs, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we and DISH DBS were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions related to our respective long-term debt. Other We are also vulnerable to fraud, particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers. While we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud, which could impact our subscriber growth and churn. Economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft, piracy and subscriber fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2017, future maturities of our long-term debt, capital lease and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter (In thousands) Long-term debt obligations $ 17,070,789 $ 1,031,074 $ 1,404,698 $ 1,104,503 $ 2,004,626 $ 2,004,756 $ 9,521,132 Capital lease obligations 104,318 37,451 19,896 19,137 20,615 7,219 Interest expense on long-term debt and capital lease obligations 5,181,572 924,452 899,444 759,846 662,939 594,457 1,340,434 Satellite-related obligations 1,233,242 348,617 301,102 241,371 208,196 125,636 8,320 Operating lease obligations 198,890 48,029 33,125 25,404 19,996 13,556 58,780 Purchase obligations 1,515,546 1,349,635 134,859 16,019 8,833 6,200 Total $ 25,304,357 $ 3,739,258 $ 2,793,124 $ 2,166,280 $ 2,925,205 $ 2,751,824 $ 10,928,666 In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent that we procure launch and/or in-orbit insurance on our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. The table above does not include $394 million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits that were accrued, as discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. We do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months. The table above does not include certain potential expenses we expect to incur for our wireless projects including, among other things, our plan to deploy a next-generation 5G-capable network, focused on supporting narrowband IoT. We currently expect expenditures for our wireless projects to be between $500 million and $1.0 billion through 2020. For further discussion see Note 14 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than the Guarantees disclosed in Note 14 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we generally do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities. 85 Table of Contents Satellite Insurance We generally do not carry commercial launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites we use, other than certain satellites leased from third parties. We generally do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of launch or in-orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk of such failures. We lease substantially all of our satellite capacity from third parties, including the vast majority of our transponder capacity from EchoStar, and we do not carry commercial insurance on any of the satellites we lease from them. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other owned or leased satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Purchase Obligations Our 2018 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for certain fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content, receiver systems and related equipment, broadband equipment, digital broadcast operations, transmission costs, streaming delivery technology and infrastructure, engineering services, and other products and services related to the operation of our Pay-TV services. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, management timing of payments and inventory purchases, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are generally contingent on the number of Pay-TV subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. These programming commitments are not included in the Commitments table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will increase to the extent we are successful in growing our Pay-TV subscriber base. In addition, programming costs per subscriber continue to increase due to contractual price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. Future Capital Requirements We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital. The amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies, depending on, among other things, the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2018, with the exception of the commercialization of our existing wireless spectrum licenses, including capital expenditures associated with our wireless projects and potential purchase of additional wireless spectrum licenses discussed below, are expected to be driven by the costs associated with subscriber premises equipment. These expenditures are necessary to operate and maintain our DISH TV services. Consequently, we consider them to be non-discretionary. The amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives that may arise from time to time. Our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time, and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or economic weakness and uncertainty. Our DISH TV subscriber base has been declining and there can be no assurance that our DISH TV subscriber base will not continue to decline and that the pace of such decline will not accelerate. In the event that our DISH TV subscriber base continues to decline, it will have a material adverse long-term effect on our cash flow. In addition, the rulings in the Telemarketing litigation requiring us to pay up to an aggregate amount of $341 million and imposing certain injunctive relief against us, if upheld, would have a material adverse effect on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities balances and our business operations. These factors, including a reduction in our available future cash flows, could require that we raise additional capital in the future. 86 Table of Contents Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at acceptable terms. These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position. Wireless Since 2008, we have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets and made over $10 billion in non-controlling investments in certain entities, for a total of over $21 billion, as described further below. DISH Network Spectrum. We have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. These wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly. In addition, as we consider our options for the commercialization of our wireless spectrum, we will incur significant additional expenses and will have to make significant investments related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and wireless network infrastructure. In March 2017, we notified the FCC that we plan to deploy a next-generation 5G-capable network, focused on supporting narrowband IoT. The first phase of our network deployment will be completed by March 2020, with subsequent phases to be completed thereafter. We currently expect expenditures for our wireless projects to be between $500 million and $1.0 billion through 2020. We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless DISH Network Spectrum in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses. Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American II and American III, we have made over $10 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, the parent company of Northstar Wireless, and in SNR HoldCo, the parent company of SNR Wireless, respectively. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 Licenses to Northstar Wireless and to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in FCC authorizations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the applicable accounting guidance in ASC 810, Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we consolidate these entities into our financial statements. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. We may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and to the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate these AWS-3 Licenses, comply with regulations applicable to such AWS-3 Licenses, and make any potential payments related to the Northstar Re-Auction Payment and the SNR Re-Auction Payment for the AWS-3 Licenses retained by the FCC. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, regulatory compliance, and potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. We may need to raise significant additional capital in the future to fund the efforts described above, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to develop and implement business models that will realize a return on these wireless spectrum licenses or that we, the Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these wireless spectrum licenses, which may affect the carrying amount of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies Wireless in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 87 Table of Contents Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity The ability to raise capital has generally existed for us despite economic weakness and uncertainty. While modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not likely impact our current operational plans, significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Capitalized premise equipment . Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs for DISH TV and broadband subscribers, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, management judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Changes in estimated useful life may impact Depreciation and amortization on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). For example, if we had decreased the estimated useful life of our capitalized subscriber equipment by one year, annual 2017 depreciation expense would have increased by approximately $71 million. Accounting for investments in private and publicly-traded securities . We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge in Other, net within Other Income (Expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other-than-temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying amount of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment current carrying amount, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of long-lived assets . We review our long-lived assets and identifiable finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets which are held and used in operations, the asset would be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeded its undiscounted future net cash flows. Once an impairment is determined, the actual impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value as estimated using one of the following approaches: income, cost and/or market. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount. In that event, a loss is recorded in Impairment of long-lived assets on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group. Fair value, using the income approach, is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model that uses the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Fair value, utilizing the cost approach, is determined based on the replacement cost of the asset reduced for, among other things, depreciation and obsolescence. Fair value, utilizing the market approach, benchmarks the fair value against the carrying amount. See Note 8 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Assets which are to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. We currently evaluate our 88 Table of Contents DBS satellite fleet for impairment as one asset group whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives . We evaluate the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset fair value exceeds its carrying amount. In our assessment, we assess relevant qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, overall financial performance, industry and market conditions, relevant company specific events, and perception of the market. When our qualitative assessment is inconclusive, further analysis is required. While our qualitative assessment for 2017, 2016 and 2015 indicated the fair value of our intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts, significant changes in our quantitative estimates of future cash flows or market data could result in a write-down of intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which will be recorded in a line item entitled Impairment of long-lived assets, on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Income taxes . Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. We periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Any such valuation allowance is recorded in either Income tax (provision) benefit, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) or Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Stockholders equity (deficit) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our consolidated results of operations. Uncertainty in tax positions . Management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law, regulations, case law, administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position. Changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our Income tax provision (benefit), net, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations. Contingent liabilities . A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period to General and administrative expenses or Litigation expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Business combinations. When we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques, including the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach. The accounting standard for business combinations requires most identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired to be recorded at estimated fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or the market approach. 89 Table of Contents Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. Backlog We do not have any material backlog of our products. New Accounting Pronouncements Revenue from Contracts with Customers. On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ), and has modified the standard thereafter. ASU 2014-09 provides a framework for revenue recognition that replaces most existing GAAP revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 also includes ASC 340-40 which codifies the guidance on other assets and deferred costs relating to contracts with customers. ASC 340-40 specifies the accounting treatment for costs an entity incurs to obtain and fulfill a contract to provide goods and services to customers. ASU 2014-09 became effective for us on January 1, 2018 and we elected to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method. The impacts of the standard to us will include, among other things, the following: We will recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a subscriber if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs, including those with our independent third-party retailers, will meet the requirements to be capitalized, and expenses incurred under these programs will therefore be capitalized and amortized over the estimated subscriber life, whereas our current policy is to expense these costs as incurred. We will change the timing of revenue recognition for certain nonrefundable upfront fees received from our residential video and broadband subscribers as these fees will be accounted for as implied performance obligations in the form of a material right to the customer related to the customer option to renew without having to pay an additional fee upon renewal. Certain contracts related to our commercial, advertising, and equipment sales have one-time payments and deliverables that are significant to those contracts and for which the timing of revenue recognition will change. Note that while the one-time payments are significant to the contracts themselves, these contracts are not significant to our overall results of operations. We have concluded that for our residential video and broadband customers under a contract, the contract term under ASU 2014-09 is one month. Accordingly, while there will be changes in the way certain upfront fees and other items are recognized as discussed above, we do not believe at this time there will be a material change to our revenue recognition model for our residential video and broadband customers. Under the modified retrospective method we will recognize an asset for capitalized commission costs only for customers for which their initial contract was considered open as of January 1, 2018. We are currently in the process of applying the new guidance to all open contracts as of January 1, 2018 with existing customers and will recognize in beginning retained earnings an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change, which we believe will be immaterial. We will provide additional disclosures for periods ending in 2018 comparing the results under previous guidance to those under the new standard. Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ) , which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This amendment requires all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have an immaterial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 90 Table of Contents Statement of Cash Flows - Update. On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ). This update consists of eight provisions that provide guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. If practicable, this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. For the provisions that are impracticable to apply retrospectively, those provisions may be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. This update will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have an immaterial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. On November 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 Restricted Cash ( ASU 2016-18 ) , which addresses the diversity where changes in restricted cash are classified on the cash flow statement. ASU 2016-18 requires that changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-18 will have an immaterial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. Leases. On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ), which relates to the accounting of leasing transactions. This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. In addition, this standard requires both lessees and lessors to disclose certain key information about lease transactions. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. Financial Instruments Credit Losses. On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13 ), which changes the way entities measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net earnings. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
