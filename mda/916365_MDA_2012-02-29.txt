Item 7 . Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com . Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: Equine, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; Hardware, truck, towing and tool products; Seasonal products, including lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys; Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; and Work/recreational clothing and footwear. We operated 1,085 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 31, 2011. Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 1,000 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores, inclusive of recently identified small market locations. Approximately 55% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45% are located in strip shopping centers. Fiscal 2011 was once again a year of strong performance for our Company. We achieved double-digit increases in both sales and earnings on top of last year record results. In fiscal 2011, our net revenues increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion compared to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010, and we increased our fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share to $3.01 versus $2.25 in fiscal 2010. We also ended the year with $199 million in cash and restricted cash after returning nearly $211 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.3%. We plan to open 90 to 95 new stores in 2012, a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.0%. We opened 85 new stores in 2011 and 74 new stores in 2010, a square footage increase of approximately 7.8% and 7.4%, respectively. Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation, a strong private label offering, and optimization of product pricing, transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our product content and enhancing our customers online experience and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth. Our store strategy features low initial capital expenditures, limited maintenance capital, and low occupancy and operating costs. The average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2011 was approximately $1.2 million. A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment), and approximately $82,000 for pre-opening costs. Our new stores are typically profitable in the first full year of operation and reach chain average in approximately five years. Our capital allocation strategy focuses first on capital expenditure requirements (to support growth and invest in existing facilities and improved information technology processes and systems), and promotes effective stockholder return through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were $166.2 million and $96.5 million, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately $160 million to $170 million as we continue to invest in new store growth, existing stores, distribution center capacity and information technology. 17 We place significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. Modifications of product offerings include increasing the quality and affordability of some items through strategic sourcing, improving our private label offerings and ensuring we have the best product mix in our stores based on the regional needs of our customers. We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store team members, have enhanced our sales and financial performance. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Management discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. 18 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Inventory Valuation: Inventory Impairment We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment. However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $590,000 in fiscal 2011. Shrinkage We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience. We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve. However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $860,000 in fiscal 2011. 19 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Vendor Support We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs. The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years. Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor product. Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold. During interim periods, the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations. Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could significantly differ from previously estimated amounts. Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented. At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known. Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support. We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2011. If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 31, 2011, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.2 million. Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales. Freight We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold. We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories. This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented. If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance, net income would have been affected by approximately $4.1 million. 20 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Self-Insurance Reserves: We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values. When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves. However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $2.0 million in fiscal 2011. Sales Tax Audit Reserve: A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment. These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state. We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits, and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities. Our sales tax audit assessment methodology remained materially consistent in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve. However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $720,000 in fiscal 2011. 21 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Tax Contingencies: Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A 10% change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December 31, 2011 would have affected net income by approximately $460,000 in fiscal 2011. 22 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset carrying value exceeds the asset estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 23 Quarterly Financial Data Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2011 and 2010 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts): First Quarter (13 weeks) Second Quarter (13 weeks) Third Quarter (13 weeks) Fourth Quarter (14 weeks) Total 2011 Net sales $ 836,576 $ 1,178,363 $ 977,776 $ 1,240,028 $ 4,232,743 Gross margin 273,606 402,497 327,603 403,166 1,406,872 Operating income 28,766 144,263 68,129 111,545 352,703 Net income 18,335 91,160 42,733 70,512 222,740 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.25 $ 1.27 $ 0.60 $ 0.99 $ 3.10 Diluted $ 0.24 $ 1.23 $ 0.58 $ 0.96 $ 3.01 Same-store sales increase 10.7 % 4.6 % 11.5 % 7.6 % 8.2 % First Quarter (13 weeks) Second Quarter (13 weeks) Third Quarter (13 weeks) Fourth Quarter (13 weeks) Total 2010 Net sales $ 710,917 $ 1,065,656 $ 829,114 $ 1,032,649 $ 3,638,336 Gross margin 230,931 360,129 275,688 336,917 1,203,665 Operating income 16,467 123,648 47,407 78,702 266,224 Net income 10,582 77,318 29,863 50,209 167,972 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.15 $ 1.06 $ 0.41 $ 0.69 $ 2.31 Diluted $ 0.14 $ 1.04 $ 0.40 $ 0.67 $ 2.25 Same-store sales increase 2.8 % 6.1 % 5.0 % 13.1 % 7.0 % (1) Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year. 24 Results of Operations Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 contained 52 weeks. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 2011 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold (a) 66.8 66.9 67.5 Gross margin (a) 33.2 33.1 32.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses (a) 23.0 23.9 24.4 Depreciation and amortization 1.9 1.9 2.1 Operating income 8.3 7.3 6.0 Interest expense, net -- -- 0.1 Income before income taxes 8.3 7.3 5.9 Income tax provision 3.0 2.7 2.2 Net income 5.3 % 4.6 % 3.7 % (a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011 from $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2010, representing approximately 170 basis points of the net sales increase. Same-store sales for fiscal 2011 were $3.99 billion, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2010. This compares to a 7.0% same-store sales increase in the prior year. The same-store transaction count increased 5.0%, while same-store average ticket increased 3.1% for fiscal 2011. The same-store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in core consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise. Emergency response related merchandise also performed well during the year as a result of Hurricane Irene and tornadoes across the southeast. We estimate that same-store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to inflation, principally in key C.U.E. categories. Additionally, fiscal 2011 had one additional comp sales day in the year, which had a favorable impact on same-store sales of approximately 30 basis points. Store growth was approximately 8.4%, a net increase of 84 stores since December 25, 2010. Non-comp sales (defined as stores opened less than one year) for fiscal 2011 were $237.5 million, a 6.4% increase over total fiscal 2010 net sales. Non-comp sales for fiscal 2010 were $205.4 million, a 6.5% increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales. In fiscal 2011, we opened 85 new stores (compared to 74 new stores in fiscal 2010), relocated three stores (compared to no relocations in fiscal 2010) and closed one store (compared to three closed stores in fiscal 2010). The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2011 and 2010: Percent of Sales Product Category: 2011 2010 Livestock and Pet 40 % 39 % Hardware, Tools and Truck 23 23 Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products 21 22 Clothing and Footwear 10 10 Agriculture 6 6 Total 100 % 100 % 25 Gross margin increased 16.9% to $1.41 billion compared to $1.20 billion in 2010. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 33.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 33.1% for fiscal 2010. The increase in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin, partially offset by increased transportation costs. Direct product margin increased as we continue to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory management, strategic sourcing, private branding and price optimization. We expect the effects of inflation to continue into and potentially throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012. Additionally, we expect transportation costs to continue to increase as a result of rising fuel costs and planned increases in our import volume as a percent of total purchases. However, we expect that we will be able to maintain reasonable margins through effective sourcing of product and retail price management. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 90 basis points to 24.9% in fiscal 2011 from 25.8% in fiscal 2010. The SG&A improvement as a percent of sales for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense control with respect to store operating costs. Total SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 12.5% to $1.05 billion from $937.4 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in SG&A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales performance, increased advertising for print media and special promotional events and expansion of our distribution center capacity and ongoing implementation of the new warehouse management system. The Company new Franklin, Kentucky distribution center opened in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010. This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits as well as the utilization of various state income tax credits during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2011 increased 32.6% to $222.7 million, or $3.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, in fiscal 2010. During 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of stock at a total cost of $180.0 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. In 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares at a total cost of $38.2 million. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales increased 13.5% to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010 from $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009. Same-store sales for fiscal 2010 were $3.43 billion, a 7.0% increase over fiscal 2009. This compares to a 1.1% same-store sales decrease in the prior year. The same-store transaction count increased 7.4%, while same-store average ticket decreased 0.3% for fiscal 2010. The same-store sales increase was broad-based and driven by strong results in core consumable categories, principally animal and pet-related products, as well as seasonal products, including heating, insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment. New store growth was approximately 7.6% or 71 net stores opened since December 26, 2009. Non-comp sales for fiscal 2010 were $205.4 million, a 6.5% increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales. Non-comp sales for fiscal 2009 were $230.7 million, a 7.7% increase over total fiscal 2008 net sales. In fiscal 2010, we opened 74 new stores (compared to 76 new stores in fiscal 2009), relocated no stores (compared to two relocations in fiscal 2009) and closed three stores (compared to one closed store in fiscal 2009). The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2010 and 2009: Percent of Sales Product Category: 2010 2009 Livestock and Pet 39 % 39 % Hardware, Tools and Truck 23 23 Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products 22 22 Clothing and Footwear 10 10 Agriculture 6 6 Total 100 % 100 % Gross margin increased 15.5% to $1.20 billion compared to $1.04 billion in 2009. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 60 basis points to 33.1% for fiscal 2010 compared to 32.5% for fiscal 2009. The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink, partially offset by increased transportation costs. The direct product margin improvement resulted from progress on certain margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing, inventory management, and more effective pricing. 26 As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 25.8% in fiscal 2010 from 26.5% in fiscal 2009. The SG&A improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense management, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense. Total SG&A expenses increased 10.2% to $937.4 million from $850.3 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in SG&A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales growth and increased incentive compensation. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 36.9% in fiscal 2009. This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2010 increased 40.3% to $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of $38.2 million as part of our previously announced share repurchase program. In 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares at a total cost of $15.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs (including inventory purchases and capital expenditures), distribution center capacity and improvements, information technology, share repurchases and cash dividends. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, borrowings available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively. Working Capital At December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $629.6 million, a $12.5 million increase from December 25, 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): 2011 2010 Variance Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 176.9 $ 257.3 $ (80.4 ) Restricted cash 21.9 -- 21.9 Short-term investments -- 15.9 (15.9 ) Inventories 830.8 736.5 94.3 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 51.7 34.0 17.7 Deferred income taxes 8.9 -- 8.9 1,090.2 1,043.7 46.5 Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 266.4 $ 247.4 $ 19.0 Accrued employee compensation 48.3 34.6 13.7 Other accrued expenses 134.0 127.4 6.6 Current portion of capital lease obligation -- 0.1 (0.1 ) Income taxes payable 11.9 8.3 3.6 Deferred income taxes -- 8.8 (8.8 ) 460.6 426.6 34.0 Working capital $ 629.6 $ 617.1 $ 12.5 In comparison to prior year-end, working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in cash. The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth and inflation. Average inventory per store increased to $723,000 for fiscal 2011 compared to $709,000 for fiscal 2010. The decrease in cash is primarily attributable to an increased volume of share repurchases as well as an increase in capital expenditures, principally due to the construction of a new distribution center. 27 Borrowings and Credit Facilities Through October 23, 2011 we were party to a Senior Credit Facility (the Credit Agreement ), which provided for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively) with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters. The Credit Agreement had an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments). The Credit Agreement was unsecured and would have matured in February 2012. On October 24, 2011, we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with largely the same lender group as under the previous Credit Agreement. The new Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $250 million (with sublimits of $250 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively). This agreement is unsecured and matures in October 2016, with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters. At December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under either Senior Credit Facility. There were $15.0 million and $27.4 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively. Borrowings bear interest at either the bank base rate (3.25% at December 31, 2011) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) (0.30% at December 31, 2011) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio (0.50% at December 31, 2011). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio, for unused capacity (0.10% at December 31, 2011). There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent). The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR. The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011. Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company common stock and payment of common stock dividends. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 254.1 $ 222.6 $ 215.3 Net cash used in investing activities (171.3 ) (112.1 ) (73.8 ) Net cash used in financing activities (163.2 ) (26.0 ) (5.6 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (80.4 ) $ 84.5 $ 135.9 Operating Activities The $31.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2011 2010 Variance Net income $ 222.7 $ 168.0 $ 54.7 Depreciation and amortization 80.3 69.8 10.5 Stock compensation expense 15.1 11.8 3.3 Deferred income taxes 1.9 2.7 (0.8 ) Inventories and accounts payable (75.3 ) (74.3 ) (1.0 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets (17.8 ) (3.2 ) (14.6 ) Accrued expenses 20.0 38.5 (18.5 ) Income taxes payable 3.6 1.0 2.6 Other, net 3.6 8.3 (4.7 ) Net cash provided by operations $ 254.1 $ 222.6 $ 31.5 28 Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger net income and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses and an increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is related to store growth and capital expenditures associated with the construction of a new distribution center. The decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments. The increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors. The $7.3 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2010 2009 Variance Net income $ 168.0 $ 119.7 $ 48.3 Depreciation and amortization 69.8 66.3 3.5 Stock compensation expense 11.8 12.1 (0.3 ) Deferred income taxes 2.7 (11.1 ) 13.8 Inventories and accounts payable (74.3 ) (29.9 ) (44.4 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets (3.2 ) 11.2 (14.4 ) Accrued expenses 38.5 22.3 16.2 Income taxes payable 1.0 7.8 (6.8 ) Other, net 8.3 16.9 (8.6 ) Net cash provided by operations $ 222.6 $ 215.3 $ 7.3 The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory, net of accounts payable, and a decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets. Continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances. Accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account. The bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable. The increase in cash provided by accrued expenses is a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2010 but not paid until fiscal 2011. The decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors. Investing Activities Investing activities used $171.3 million, $112.1 million and $73.8 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures. Our significant store expansion, coupled with distribution network expansion and other required investments in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Distribution center capacity and improvements $ 56.3 $ 22.5 $ 4.3 New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened 44.9 28.6 31.7 Purchase of previously leased and self developed stores 32.2 11.6 -- Existing stores 18.7 17.6 18.4 Information technology 12.3 14.9 17.6 Corporate and other 1.8 1.3 2.0 $ 166.2 $ 96.5 $ 74.0 The above table reflects 85 new stores and three relocations in fiscal 2011, compared to 74 new stores during fiscal 2010. We also purchased 12 of our existing lease stores during fiscal 2011 compared to four existing stores in fiscal 2010. The increase in capital expenditures for distribution center capacity in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the construction of a new distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky and the implementation of a new warehouse management system in two of our seven distribution centers. Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets. We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $160 million and $170 million in fiscal 2012. We plan to open approximately five to 10 more stores in fiscal 2012 compared to 2011. While we do not plan to open a new distribution center in fiscal 2012, we estimate to spend approximately $30 million on our distribution center network, principally for the acquisition of a site to relocate our southeast distribution center as well as other improvements in the existing distribution centers such as conveyor systems and other infrastructure enhancements. Additionally, we plan to invest approximately $30 million in information technology upgrades, including point-of-sale system enhancements, continued roll-out of the new warehouse management system to distribution centers, an upgrade of our e-commerce site, and store and store support center hardware refreshes. 29 Financing Activities Financing activities used $163.2 million, $26.0 million, and $5.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2011 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation. On April 28, 2011, the Company Board of Directors authorized a $600 million increase to the existing share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to an aggregate of $1 billion of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through April 2015. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares will be held in treasury. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. We repurchased approximately 3.1 million, 0.8 million and 0.4 million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $180.0 million, $38.2 million and $15.3 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. As of December 31, 2011, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $562.9 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.07 per share to $0.12 per share. We paid dividends totaling $30.9 million and $20.4 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations, and distribution center capacity, over the next several years. Significant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Payment Due by Period Total Contractual Obligations Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years Operating leases $ 1,620,771 $ 188,311 $ 358,343 $ 318,176 $ 755,941 Capital leases (1) 2,511 146 292 292 1,781 Purchase obligations (2) 9,413 9,413 -- -- -- $ 1,632,695 $ 197,870 $ 358,635 $ 318,468 $ 757,722 (1) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (2) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2012, as well as the purchase of a previously leased store. At December 31, 2011, there were $15.0 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility and a $20.9 million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility which is collateralized by a time deposit classified as restricted cash. The letter of credit outside the Senior Credit Facility will automatically increase by $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 bringing the total outstanding letter of credit balance to $21.9 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs. 30 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The ASU gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount ( qualitative assessment ). If it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, an entity would not be required to perform the existing two-step impairment test. The amendments to Topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2011-08 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. I tem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the bank base rate (3.25% at both December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010) or LIBOR (0.30% and 0.26% at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively) plus an additional amount per annum adjusted quarterly (ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% at December 31, 2011 and 0.35% to 0.90% at December 25, 2010) based on our leverage ratio (0.50% and 0.40% at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively). We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee (ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% at December 31, 2011 and 0.06% to 0.18% at December 25, 2010) based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.10% at December 31, 2011 and 0.08% December 25, 2010). Seasonality and Weather Our business is highly seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores and our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the cold-weather selling season. Purchase Price Volatility Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both. We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services. Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin. Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality. Due to the competitive environment, such conditions could adversely impact our financial performance. 31
