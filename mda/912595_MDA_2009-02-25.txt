ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial instruments. Revenue recognition We lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned. We record all gains and losses on sales of real estate in accordance with Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate . Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets We carry real estate assets at depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, 3 to 5 years for computers and software, and 1 year for acquired leases, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. Development costs, which in 2008 were limited to adding new units to three existing properties, are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost . Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , or Statement 144, and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or Statement 142. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors. 27 In accordance with Statement 144, long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. In accordance with Statement 142, goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare the fair value to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. We determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations . The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of derivative financial instruments Mid-America utilizes certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While Mid-America calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by Mid-America before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated. Mid-America measures ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity. On January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or Statement 157. Statement 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157 applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements; accordingly, the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances. 28 Statement 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, Statement 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that Mid-America has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability which are typically based on an entity own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Mid-America assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. To comply with the provisions of Statement 157, Mid-America incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. Although Mid-America has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties. As of December 31, 2008, Mid-America has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, Mid-America has determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2008, Mid-America had a total of $990.5 million of notional amount in derivative instruments, all of which had fair values measured using Level 3 inputs. Realized and unrealized losses did not materially affect our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources during the year. Mid-America experienced an overall decrease in fair value of our derivatives due to the fluctuations in the interest rate market throughout the year. 29 OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 Mid-America experienced an increase in income from continuing operations before non-operating items in 2008 as we continued to grow our portfolio through acquisitions and limited development and our same store portfolio maintained an average occupancy of 95.3% and raised average effective rents by 1.8% over 2007. Our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months. Communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified as discontinued operations. Mid-America has grown externally during the past three years by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Mid-America acquired six properties in 2006, four properties in 2007 and five properties in 2008. Mid-America also purchased two properties through a joint venture in 2008. Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream is five property dispositions in 2007, one of which was through a joint venture. Mid-America also benefited from reduced interest expense in 2008 as our twelve month average interest rate dropped from 5.4% in 2007 to 4.9% in 2008. The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Mid-America for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2008, the total number of apartment units Mid-America owned or had an ownership interest in was 42,554 in 145 communities, compared to 40,248 apartment units in 137 communities at December 31, 2007, and 40,293 apartment units in 138 communities at December 31, 2006. For communities owned 100% by Mid-America, the average monthly rental per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, increased to $750 at December 31, 2008 from $743 at December 31, 2007, and $726 at December 31, 2006. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was 93.4%, 94.7%, and 94.2%, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by approximately $22.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, due to (i) a $7.1 million increase in property revenues from the five properties acquired in 2008, or the 2008 acquisitions, (ii) a $5.8 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2007, or the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) a $1.7 million increase in property revenues from our development communities, and (iv) a $7.7 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by Mid-America same store portfolio and was driven by a 1.8% increase in average effective rent per unit in 2008 over 2007. 30 Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by approximately $12.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $3.5 million from the 2008 acquisitions, (ii) $2.9 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) $0.8 million from our development communities, and (iv) $5.7 million from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of Mid-America same store portfolio and represented an average 3.5% increase over prior year expenses and included $591,000 of expense related to Hurricane Ike. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $5.4 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $2.3 million from the 2008 acquisitions, (ii) $1.6 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) $0.3 million from our development communities, and (iv) $3.0 million from fixed asset additions at communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $1.8 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of communities which we previously acquired. Property management expenses decreased by approximately $1.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007, to the year ended December 31, 2008, due to decreased incentive compensation. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million over this same period mainly as a result of increased personnel costs. Interest expense decreased approximately $1.6 million in 2008 from 2007 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 5.4% in 2007 to 4.9% in 2008. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately $83.8 million from 2007 to 2008 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America recorded total gains of approximately $5.4 million from the sale of a community owned through a joint venture. The sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to Mid-America of approximately $1.0 million in 2007. In 2007, Mid-America also benefited from a $9.2 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities owned directly by Mid-America. Mid-America had no property dispositions in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America recorded net casualty gains and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling $1.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Mid-America recorded a loss of $0.3 million for these same items. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income decreased by approximately $9.7 million in 2008 from 2007. COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by approximately $29.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006, due to (i) a $4.8 million increase in property revenues from the 2007 acquisitions, (ii) an $11.5 million increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2006, or the 2006 acquisitions, (iii) a $0.8 million increase in property revenues from the development communities, and (iv) a $12.1 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by Mid-America same store portfolio and was driven by an average 2.5% increase in average rent per unit in 2007 over 2006. 31 Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by approximately $9.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2006, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $2.1 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (ii) $5.0 million from the 2006 acquisitions, (iii) $0.3 million form the development communities, and (iv) $2.4 million from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of Mid-America same store portfolio and represented an average 2.7% increase over prior year expenses. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $7.2 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $1.2 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (ii) $3.3 million from the 2006 acquisitions, (iii) $0.2 million from the development communities, (iv) $1.8 million from fixed asset additions at the communities held throughout both periods, and (v) $0.7 million from the amortization of fair market value of leases of acquired communities. Property management expenses increased by approximately $4.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2006, to the year ended December 31, 2007, partially due to increased incentive compensation as a result of improved property performance and increased franchise and excise taxes due to state tax law changes. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.9 million over this same period also partially related to increased incentive compensation due to improved performance. Interest expense increased approximately $1.3 million in 2007 from 2006 due primarily to the approximate $42.4 million increase in the average debt outstanding from 2006 due to acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America recorded total gains of approximately $5.4 million from the sale of a community owned through a joint venture. The sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to Mid-America of approximately $1.0 million in 2007. In 2007, Mid-America also benefited from a $9.2 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities owned directly by Mid-America. Mid-America had no property dispositions in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America recorded net casualty gains and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling $1.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Mid-America recorded $0.1 million for these same items. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income increased by approximately $19.0 million in 2007 over 2006. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, minority interest in operating partnership income, gains on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the NAREIT definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage. 32 In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock, Mid- America has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our FFO calculation. Mid-America's policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Mid-America believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Mid-America's operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. Mid-America believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Mid-America calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to net income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 (dollars and shares in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 30,249 $ 39,946 $ 20,945 Depreciation of real estate assets 88,555 83,532 76,205 Net casualty (gains) loss and other settlement proceeds 247 (589 ) (84 ) Gains on dispositions within real estate joint ventures (38 ) (5,388 ) Depreciation of real estate assets of discontinued operations 706 1,517 2,003 (Gains) loss on sales of discontinued operations 120 (9,164 ) Depreciation of real estate assets of real estate joint ventures 953 15 500 Preferred dividend distribution (12,865 ) (13,688 ) (13,962 ) Minority interest in operating partnership income 1,822 3,510 1,590 Premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock (589 ) Funds from operations $ 109,749 $ 99,102 $ 87,197 Weighted average shares and units: Basic 29,356 27,777 25,979 Diluted 29,459 27,943 26,204 FFO increases for both 2008 over 2007, and 2007 over 2006 were principally the result of improved community operations from Mid-America same store portfolio and the addition of communities from the 2006 acquisitions, 2007 acquisitions and 2008 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above. 33 TRENDS During the first half of 2008, rental demand for apartments continued at robust levels in most of our markets with the notable exception of Florida, where after several years of good growth, markets weakened. Towards the end of the second quarter, we experienced a reduction in our rate of revenue growth, which we think is likely to be due to the slowdown in general economic conditions. During the third quarter and through the end of 2008, the rate of revenue growth continued to slow. Job formation, which is a primary driver of demand by apartment residents, weakened towards the end of the second quarter and through the end of 2008. On the supply side, new apartment construction continued to be limited, as in most markets, rents have yet to rise sufficiently to offset the rapid run-up of costs of new construction over the last five years and financing for new development has become difficult to obtain. Competition from condominiums reverting back to being rental units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, was not a major factor in most of our markets because most of our markets and submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development. We have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes. We have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred. We are seeing significant rental competition from condominiums and single family houses in only a few submarkets. The primary reason that our residents leave us is to buy a house, but we have seen that reason as a percent of total move-outs drop over the past twelve months. Analysts point out that homeownership increased from 65% to over 69% of households over ten years ending in 2005. This increase, representing approximately five million households, was driven primarily by the availability of new mortgage products, many requiring no down-payment and minimal credit ratings. With a reversion of mortgage underwriting back to more traditional standards, it is possible that a long-term correction will occur, and that home ownership may return to more sustainable levels. This could be quite significant for the apartment business, and we believe, if this occurs, it could benefit us for several years. We believe that the signs of slower revenue growth will be temporary, and that revenue growth should resume in 2010. We also believe reduced availability of financing for new apartment construction will likely limit new apartment supply, and more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. At the same time, we expect long term demographic trends, including the growth of prime age groups for rentals, immigration, and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets. While it seems possible that in 2009 we will face declining economic growth as a result of reduced liquidity in the economy, we think that the supply of new apartments is not excessive, and that positive absorption of apartments will return for most of our markets in 2010. Should the economy fall into a deeper recession, the limited new supply of apartments and the more disciplined mortgage financing for single family home buying should lessen the impact. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $19.4 million to $137.9 million for 2008, compared to $118.6 million for 2007, mainly related to the growth of Mid-America through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2008. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $16.1 million to $118.6 million for 2007 compared to $102.5 million for 2006 mainly related to the growth of Mid-America through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2007. 34 Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $243.0 million, $108.8 million and $241.1 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The change in net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity. A total of approximately $156.3 million was invested in 2008 to acquire properties, this compares to approximately $88.6 million in 2007, and $195.0 million in 2006. Mid-America began limited development activities in 2006, which used net cash of approximately $10.9 million in 2006, $14.6 million in 2007 and $22.7 million in 2008. Mid-America also expanded our renovation activities using net cash of approximately $6.1 million in 2006, $11.3 million in 2007 and $18.2 million in 2008. In 2007, Mid-America received a total of $39.2 million from the disposition of real estate assets, mainly related to property sales. No communities were sold in 2006 or 2008. Net cash provided by financing activities was $97.3 million, $1.9 million and $130.1 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The fluctuation in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly impacted by proceeds from issuances of common shares and units. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in 2006 to approximately $152.0 million primarily due to Mid-America raising of funds through stock issuances from our direct stock purchase plan, a controlled equity plan and an overnight offering. During 2007, Mid-America was not as active in raising funds through these equity plans; however, in 2008 Mid-America raised a total of $126.0 million of proceeds from issuances of common shares and units, primarily through a controlled equity plan. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was also impacted by the redemption of our 9 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series F, for $11.9 million. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2008 for the $1.3 billion of debt outstanding was 4.8%, compared to the weighted average interest rate of 5.4% on $1.3 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2007. We utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages as well as company-wide secured credit facilities. We utilize fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk. More details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section. At December 31, 2008, we had secured credit facility relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, Financial Federal which are credit enhanced by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and a $50 million bank facility. Together, these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of $1.39 billion and collateralized availability to borrow of $1.36 billion at December 31, 2008. We had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $1.18 billion at December 31, 2008. Approximately 68% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2008 were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA, also referred to as the FNMA Facilities. The FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $1.04 billion, all of which was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2008. We had total borrowings outstanding under the FNMA Facilities of approximately $905 million at December 31, 2008. Various traunches of the FNMA Facilities mature from 2011 through 2018. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, which are credit-enhanced by FNMA and are typically sold every 90 days by Prudential Mortgage Capital at interest rates approximating three-month LIBOR less an average spread of 0.05% - 0.13% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.49% to 0.795%. While, generally, the DMBS continued to trade below three-month LIBOR, the spread between them increased during the fourth quarter of 2007 and during 2008, ranging from 0.05% above three-month LIBOR to 1.23% below three-month LIBOR. While we feel this recent volatility is an anomaly and believe that this spread will return to more historic levels, we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change. 35 Approximately 21% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2008 were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by Freddie Mac, also referred to as the Freddie Mac Facilities. The Freddie Mac Facilities have a combined line limit of $300 million, of which $276 million was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2008. We had total borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facilities of approximately $276 million at December 31, 2008. The Freddie Mac facilities mature in 2011 and 2014. The interest rate on the Freddie Mac Facilities renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the Freddie Mac Reference Bill Rate on the date of renewal, which has historically approximated LIBOR, plus a credit enhancement fee of 65 basis points to 69 basis points. The Freddie Mac Reference Bill rate has traded consistently below LIBOR, and the historical average spread has risen recently from the more normal 15 basis points to 17 basis points below LIBOR to 41 basis points below LIBOR with a high of 200 basis points below LIBOR on November 1, 2008. Each of our secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and is subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods, one or more of our lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect. The following schedule details the line limits, collateralized availability and the outstanding balances of our various borrowings as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Line Amount Amount Limit Collateralized Borrowed FNMA Credit Facilities $ 1,044,429 $ 1,044,429 $ 904,833 Freddie Mac Credit Facilities 300,000 275,929 275,929 Regions Credit Facility 50,000 43,863 661 Regions Term Loan 38,625 38,625 38,625 Other Borrowings 103,008 103,008 103,008 Total Debt $ 1,536,062 $ 1,505,854 $ 1,323,056 As of December 31, 2008, we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of $908 million. To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. We had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $82 million as of December 31, 2008. 36 The following schedule outlines our variable versus fixed rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps and caps, outstanding as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Average Years to Principal Contract Effective Balance Maturity Rate Conventional - Fixed Rate or Swapped (1) $ 1,018,484 4.1 5.5 % Tax-free - Fixed Rate or Swapped (1) 37,730 8.3 4.7 % Conventional - Variable Rate 179,796 5.2 2.5 % Tax-free - Variable Rate 4,760 19.4 3.9 % Conventional - Variable Rate - Capped (2) 17,936 0.9 2.8 % Tax-free - Variable Rate - Capped (2) 64,350 3.2 1.8 % Total Debt Outstanding $ 1,323,056 4.5 4.8 % ____________________ (1) Maturities on existing swapped balances are calculated using the life of the underlying variable debt. (2) When the capped rates of 6.0% and 6.5% are not reached, the average rate represents the rate on the underlying variable debt. We only have two scheduled refinancings prior to 2011. One is a $39 million mortgage with Regions Bank that matures April 1, 2009. We plan to replace the Regions debt with mortgages from Freddie Mac which were put in place in the fourth quarter of 2008. The other is the $50 million credit facility with a group of banks led by Regions Bank that matures May 24, 2010.

During 2008, Mid-America sold 1,955,300 shares of common stock through our continuous equity offering program generating net proceeds of approximately $103.6 million. In 2007 and 2006, Mid-America sold 323,700 shares and 194,000 shares generating net proceeds of approximately $18.8 million and $11.5 million, respectively. During 2008, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 403,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $20 million in proceeds. During 2007 and 2006, Mid-America also offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 120,000 and 1,340,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $6 million and $77 million in proceeds, respectively. On October 16, 2007, Mid-America redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series F for the total redemption price of $11.9 million. In May 2006, Mid-America sold 1,150,000 shares of common stock through a public offering generating net proceeds of approximately $59.5 million. We believe that we have adequate resources to fund our current operations, annual refurbishment of our properties, and incremental investment in new apartment properties. We rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and on FNMA and Freddie Mac, or the Agencies, who have now been placed into conservatorship by the U.S. Government, and whose securities are now implicitly Government-guaranteed. The Agencies provide credit enhancement for approximately $1.2 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2008. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, is the appointed conservator of the Agencies, and in a press release dated September 12, 2008, stated that business will continue as usual at the Enterprises during the conservatorship this applies to both their single family and multifamily businesses. FHFA recognizes the importance of all aspects of the Enterprises multifamily businesses for a healthy secondary market and housing affordability. In particular, support for multifamily housing finance is central to the Enterprises public purpose As conservator, FHFA expects each Enterprise to continue underwriting and financing sound multifamily business. The interest rate markets for FNMA DMBS and Freddie Mac Reference Bills, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. Prudential Mortgage Capital, a DUS lender for Fannie Mae, markets 90-day Fannie Mae Discount Mortgage Backed Securities monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at DMBS rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between Prudential and us. Financial Federal, a Freddie Mac Program Plus Lender and Servicer, is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between Financial Federal and us. 38 For the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $12.7 million, as compared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2007. This compares to a shortfall for the twelve months of 2005 of approximately $4.5 million. While we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. The following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2008, (dollars in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt (2) $ 40,357 $ 2,488 $ 178,333 $ 82,036 $ 161,039 $ 858,803 $ 1,323,056 Fixed Rate or Swapped Interest (3) 51,186 43,123 35,404 26,403 18,911 29,076 204,103 Operating Lease 16 16 16 8 56 Total $ 91,559 $ 45,627 $ 213,753 $ 108,447 $ 179,950 $ 887,879 $ 1,527,215 ____________________ (1) Fixed rate and swapped interest are shown in this table. The average interest rates of variable rate debt are shown in preceeding and following tables. (2) Represents principal payments. (3) Swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in Note 7 to the financial statements. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2008, and 2007, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Our two joint ventures with Crow Holdings (one terminated in 2005 and one terminated in 2007) were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance our return on investment through the generation of fee income. Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, was established to acquire $500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2008, Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC owned two properties but did not expect to acquire any additional communities. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14. Our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest. 39 INSURANCE Mid-America renegotiated our insurance programs effective July 1, 2008. We believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation. We expect the renegotiated programs to result in a reduction in annual policy premiums of approximately $1.3 million when compared to the higher rates experienced with the prior policy. INFLATION Substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable Mid-America to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to Mid-America of the adverse effects of inflation. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 Fair Value Measurements , or Statement 157. Statement 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2 Effective Date of FASB Statement 157 , or FSP 157-2, delays the effective date of Statement 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. For these items, the effective date will be for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted Statement 157 effective January 1, 2008. We do not believe the adoption has had or will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations , or Statement 141R. Statement 141R will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under Statement 141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Statement 141R will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including acquisition costs which will generally be expensed as incurred. This will have a material impact on the way we account for property acquisitions and therefore will have a material impact on our financial statements. Statement 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51 , or Statement 160. Statement 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent's equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. Statement 160 clarifies that changes in a parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. This will impact our financial statement presentation by requiring the minority interests in the operating partnership to be presented as a non-controlling interest as a component of equity. Statement 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. 40 On March 19, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - an Amendment of FASB Statement 133, or Statement 161 . Statement 161 enhances required disclosures regarding derivatives and hedging activities, including enhanced disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments and how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Statement 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities to clarify that unvested share-based awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share, or EPS, under the two-class method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share . This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. All prior period EPS data presented are to be adjusted retrospectively (including interim financial statements, summaries of earnings, and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions of this FSP. Management does not believe that the adoption of this FSP will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In September 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 08-5, Issuer Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement , or EITF 08-5. EITF 08-5 requires that the measurement of liabilities with inseparable, third-party credit enhancements carried at or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis exclude the effect of the credit enhancement. EITF 08-5 is effective on a prospective basis in the first reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and the effect of initially applying EITF 08-5 shall be included in the fair value in the period of adoption. Management is evaluating the impact that EITF 08-5 will have on our financial statements.
