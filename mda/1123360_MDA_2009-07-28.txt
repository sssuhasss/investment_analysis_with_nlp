ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this report. See also Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements located above Item 1 Business. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data appearing elsewhere in this annual report. General We are a leading payment processing and consumer money transfer company. As a high-volume processor of electronic transactions, we enable merchants, multinational corporations, financial institutions, consumers, government agencies and other profit and non-profit business enterprises to facilitate payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals. Our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that must occur between parties so that a payment transaction or money transfer can be completed. We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000 and we spun-off from our former parent company in January 2001. Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have provided transaction processing services since 1967. We market our products and services throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. We operate in three business segments; North America merchant services, International merchant services and Money transfer, and we offer various products through these segments. Our two merchant services segments target customers in many vertical industries including financial institutions, government, professional services, restaurants, universities, utilities, gaming, retail and health care. Our money transfer segment primarily targets Latin American immigrants in the United States and Europe. See Note 12 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional segment information. Our offerings in our merchant services segments provide merchants, independent sales organizations, or ISOs, and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing, as well as check-related services. We use two basic business models to market our merchant services offerings. One model, referred to as direct, features a salaried and commissioned sales force, ISOs and independent sales representatives, all of whom sell our end-to-end services directly to merchants. Our other model, referred to as indirect, provides similar basic products and services as our direct model, primarily to financial institutions and a limited number of ISOs on an unbundled basis, that in turn resell our products and services to merchants. Both our North America and International merchant services segments utilize a combination of the direct and indirect models. Direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value, whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount per transaction or per service rendered. In both merchant services models, we also charge for other processing fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. Our money transfer segment provides money transfer services and revenue is primarily generated based on a fee paid by the customer which is in turn based on the nature and amount of the transaction. A majority of the revenue derived from our money transfer offering consists of our electronic money transfer services marketed under our DolEx brand to the population of first generation Latin Americans living in the United States. This consumer segment enables customers to transfer money to family and friends living in Latin America. Our Europhil brand operates money transfer origination locations in Europe and settlement locations in Morocco, the Philippines, Romania, Poland and other destinations. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our products and services are marketed through a variety of distinct sales channels that include a dedicated direct sales force, ISOs, an internal telesales group, retail outlets, trade associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions. Executive Overview During fiscal 2009, we experienced revenue growth of 26%. Operating income declined significantly due to a pre-tax impairment charge of $147.7 million in our money transfer business resulting from our annual goodwill impairment test. The outlook for our money transfer business has declined given the difficult macroeconomic conditions directly impacting this segment customer base. Additionally, our results were affected by unfavorable foreign currency trends. On June 30, 2008, we acquired a 51% majority ownership interest in HSBC Merchant Services LLP (the LLP ). The LLP provides payment processing services to merchants in the United Kingdom and Internet merchants globally. We paid HSBC Bank plc ( HSBC UK ) $438.6 million for our interest. We manage the day-to-day operations of the partnership, control all major decisions and, accordingly, consolidate the partnership financial results for accounting purposes effective with the closing date. HSBC UK retained ownership of the remaining 49% and contributed its existing merchant acquiring business in the United Kingdom to the partnership. In addition, HSBC UK entered into a ten-year marketing alliance with the partnership in which HSBC UK will refer customers to the partnership for payment processing services in the United Kingdom. On June 12, 2009, we completed the purchase of the remaining 49% of the LLP from HSBC UK and extended our marketing alliance agreement to 2019. Total consideration paid for the remaining interest in the LLP was $307.7 million in cash. We used existing lines of credit and available cash to complete the transaction. On July 10, 2009 we entered into a new $300.0 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. We will use the proceeds of this term loan to pay down our existing credit facility which was used to fund the purchase of our remaining 49% interest in the LLP. The term loan expires in 2012 and has a variable interest rate based on London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin based on our leverage position. On April 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding stock of ZAO United Card Service ( UCS ), a leading direct merchant acquirer and indirect payment processor in the Russian Federation, from ZAO United Investments. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a total of $75.0 million in cash to acquire UCS. As of May 31, 2009, $55.0 million of the purchase price was held in escrow (the escrow account ). Prior to our acquisition of UCS, the former parent of company of UCS pledged the company stock as collateral for a third party loan (the loan ) that matures on September 24, 2009. Upon repayment of this loan, the stock will be released to us and $35.0 million of the purchase price will be released to the seller. The remaining $20.0 million will remain in escrow until January 1, 2013, to satisfy any liabilities discovered post-closing that existed at the purchase date. Upon acquisition of UCS Global Payments assumed an indirect guarantee of the loan. In the event of a default by the third-party debtor, we would be required to transfer all of the shares of UCS to the trustee or pay the amount outstanding under the loan. At May 31, 2009 the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee was $44.1 million which represents the total outstanding under the loan, consisting of $21.8 million due and paid on June 24, 2009 and $22.3 million due on September 24, 2009. Should the third-party debtor default on the final payment, Global Payments would pay the total amount outstanding and seek to be reimbursed for any payments made from the $55 million held in the escrow account. We did not record an obligation for this guarantee because we determined that the fair value of the guarantee is de minimis. Revenues increased $327.3 million during fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. Our North America merchant services segment reported growth primarily driven by our ISO channel which continues to drive expanding market share in the United States as evidenced by our 17% transaction growth for the year. In Canada, revenue was driven by successful pricing initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements impact and modest macroeconomic-based softening in our Canadian volumes. In addition, revenues increased in our International merchant services segment due to our June 30, 2008 acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP and strong growth in the Asia Pacific region. Our money transfer business continues to face a difficult environment for United States construction and Latino immigration trends; however we have initiated cost containment measures resulting in increased margins. Operating margins were impacted by negative currency exchange rates and modest softening across all of our businesses due to the macroeconomic environment. For the year ended May 31, 2009 currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our revenues by $88.2 million and our earnings by $0.23 per diluted share. To calculate the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations we converted our fiscal 2009 actual revenues at fiscal 2008 rates. Further future fluctuations in currency exchange rates or decreases in consumer spending could cause our results to differ from our current expectations. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2008 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2009 and 2008, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2008. 2009 % of Revenue (1) 2008 % of Revenue (1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: United States $ 805,557 50 % $ 731,215 57 % $ 74,342 10 % Canada 301,294 19 267,249 21 34,045 13 North America merchant services 1,106,851 69 998,464 78 108,387 11 Europe 265,121 17 59,778 5 205,343 344 Asia-Pacific 90,334 6 72,367 6 17,967 25 International merchant services 355,455 22 132,145 10 223,310 169 United States 112,429 7 119,019 9 (6,590 ) (6 ) Europe 26,789 2 24,601 2 2,188 9 Money transfer 139,218 9 143,620 11 (4,402 ) (3 ) Total revenues $ 1,601,524 100 % $ 1,274,229 100 % $ 327,295 26 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 598,785 37.4 % $ 475,612 37.3 % $ 123,173 26 % Sales, general and administrative 693,646 43.3 545,941 42.8 147,705 27 Impairment, restructuring and other 147,664 9.2 1,317 0.1 146,347 NM Operating income $ 161,429 10.1 % $ 251,359 19.7 % $ (89,930 ) (36 )% Operating (loss) income for segments: North America merchant services $ 272,972 $ 275,356 $ (2,384 ) (1 )% International merchant services 82,763 17,674 65,089 368 Money transfer 16,547 13,635 2,912 21 Corporate (63,189 ) (53,989 ) (9,200 ) (17 ) Impairment, restructuring and other (147,664 ) (1,317 ) (146,347 ) NM Operating income $ 161,429 $ 251,359 $ (89,930 ) (36 )% Operating margin for segments: North America merchant services 24.7 % 27.6 % (2.9 )% International merchant services 23.3 % 13.4 % 9.9 % Money transfer segment 11.9 % 9.5 % 2.4 % (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. NM Not Meaningful 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues We derive our revenues from three primary sources: charges based on volumes, charges based on transaction quantity, and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, and general economic conditions. In fiscal 2009, revenues increased 26% to $1,601.5 million compared to the prior year. We attribute this revenue growth primarily to our acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP in our International merchant services segment and to growth in our North America merchant services segment. This growth was partially offset by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2009, currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our revenues by $88.2 million. We intend to continue to grow our domestic and international presence, build our ISO sales channel, increase customer satisfaction, assess opportunities for profitable growth through acquisitions, pursue enhanced products and services for our customers, and leverage our existing business model. North America Merchant Services Segment In fiscal 2009, revenue from our North America merchant services segment increased 11% to $1,106.9 million compared to the prior year. We have continued to grow our United States channel by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISOs. For fiscal 2009, our United States direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 17% and our total United States revenue grew 10% compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year, our United States direct credit and debit card average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, decreased in the high single-digit percentage range. We believe this decline was due to a combination of lower consumer spending as a result of a weakened economy, the industry shift of increasing debit transactions, as well as the shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISO channel. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets than larger merchants. The effect of consumers replacing cash-based payments with debit card transactions also lowers our overall U.S. average ticket amounts. Based on our mix of merchants, slightly more than half of our U.S. transactions are comprised of a combination of signature- and PIN-based debit. Aside from the impact of changes in our average ticket, the remaining difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth is due to our service fees, equipment fees, check-related services, and our domestic indirect revenue. The total of this revenue grew at a lower rate than our United States direct credit and debit card transaction growth. For fiscal 2009, our Canadian revenue grew 13% compared to the prior year period. This growth was primarily due to successful pricing initiatives and, to a lesser extent, transaction growth of 4%, partially offset by an unfavorable Canadian currency exchange rate. In addition, our average ticket in Canada declined in the low single-digit range, which we believe may be partially due to lower consumer spending as a result of a weakened economy. International Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2009, our International merchant services revenue increased 169% to $355.5 million compared to the prior year. In Europe, this growth was primarily due to our acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP. Revenues attributed to this acquisition were $203.5 million during fiscal 2009. Our Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2009 increased 25% to $90.3 million compared to the prior year period. Our Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue has grown due to the favorable impact of our acquisition in the Philippines on September 4, 2008, expansion of our customer base, the introduction of new product offerings, and strategic pricing initiatives. 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Money Transfer Segment In fiscal 2009, revenue from our money transfer segment decreased 3% to $139.2 million compared to the prior year. Our United States money transfer channel relates to all revenue originating from the money transfer branches that we operate in the United States, which may include money transfers to destinations both inside and outside of the United States. For fiscal 2009, our United States money transfer channel transactions decreased 16% and revenue decreased 6%, compared to the prior year. Revenue decreased less than transactions primarily due to pricing initiatives. As a result of our continuing efforts to close unprofitable branches, our United States branch footprint decreased to 741 branches as of May 31, 2009, compared to 793 branch locations as of May 31, 2008. On a sequential basis, our domestic branch footprint as of May 31, 2009 decreased by 15 locations compared to our domestic branch footprint as of February 28, 2009. This decrease in domestic branches was the result of the closure of underperforming locations, partially offset by new branch openings. We believe that an extended downturn in the United States construction market, immigrant labor trends, and a decrease in overall economic growth have negatively affected our United States money transfer channel. Our European money transfer channel relates to all revenue generated from the money transfer branches that we operate in Europe, which may include money transfers to destinations both inside and outside of Europe. For fiscal 2009, our European money transfer revenue grew 9%, with transaction declines of 1%. Our revenue growth exceeded transaction growth due to higher pricing compared to the prior year and our acquisition of LFS Spain in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. In Europe, we decreased our branch footprint to 77 locations as of May 31, 2009, compared to 90 locations as of May 31, 2008, through the sale of our Belgium branches and branch closures. The vast majority of our revenue in this channel is generated in Spain. Similar to the United States, Spain has experienced a decrease in economic growth, which has negatively affected this channel. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operational-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement function; assessment fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs of settlement channels for money transfer services; transition services paid to HSBC in the Asia-Pacific market and the United Kingdom; network telecommunications capability, depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Cost of service increased 26% to $598.8 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. The growth in cost of service expenses is primarily due to the acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP and increases in variable processing expenses, such as card network assessments and fees, associated with our revenue growth. Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management, commissions to independent contractors and ISOs, advertising costs, other selling expenses, share-based compensation expenses and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 27% to $693.6 million in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 43.3% for fiscal 2009 compared to 42.8% in the prior year. The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses is due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel and the acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. In addition, during fiscal 2008 we recorded a favorable impact from a non-recurring, non-cash operating tax item of $7.0 million. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to the segments operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. North America Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the North America merchant services segment decreased 1% to $273.0 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 24.7% and 27.6% for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the negative impact of the Canadian Dollar exchange rate. In addition, fiscal 2008 reflects a favorable impact of a non-recurring, non-cash operating tax item of $7.0 million. Growth in the ISO channel also negatively impacted fiscal 2009 margins. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. International Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the International merchant services segment increased 368% to $82.8 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 23.3% and 13.4% for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. This growth in operating margin and operating income was primarily due to the acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP in the United Kingdom. In the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation our contracts with key indirect merchant acquiring customers are subject to periodic renewal. Such renewals may include lower fees which may negatively impact our margins. Money Transfer Segment Operating income in the money transfer segment increased 21% to $16.5 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. This increase resulted in an operating margin of 11.9% for fiscal 2009, compared to 9.5% in the prior year. These results were primarily due to the impact of stabilized pricing, the closure of underperforming branch locations, and reduced overhead costs. In addition, during the prior year, we incurred costs associated with the closure of underperforming locations, such as lease termination fees and fixed asset write-offs. Corporate Our corporate expenses primarily include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, insurance, employee incentive programs, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. Corporate also includes expenses associated with our share-based compensation programs. Our corporate costs increased 17% to $63.2 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. Impairment Charges The downturn in the United States construction market, immigrant labor trends, and overall decrease in economic growth in the United States and Spain contributed to decreased projected future cash flows for our United States and Europe Money Transfer reporting units. This decrease in projected cash flows resulted in the carrying amounts of these reporting units being greater than the fair values; therefore, goodwill was deemed impaired. Our DolEx trademark in our United States Money Transfer reporting unit was also deemed to be impaired. In addition, we reviewed the long-lived assets of these reporting units for impairment pursuant to the guidance in FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and recorded an impairment charge for certain of our long-lived assets. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following details the impairment charge resulting from our review (in thousands): Year Ended May 31, 2009 Goodwill $ 136,800 Trademark 10,000 Other long-lived assets 864 Total $ 147,664 Consolidated Operating Income Consolidated operating income decreased 36% to $161.4 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. This change resulted in an operating margin of 10.1% for fiscal 2009 compared to 19.7% in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the non-cash impairment charge in our Money Transfer segment of $147.7 million related to the write-down of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates somewhat offset by the favorable impact of the HSBC UK acquisition. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other income and expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense. Other income, net decreased $10.0 million for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. This decrease was largely due to lower investment balances and rates of return. Interest rates decreased during fiscal year 2009 when compared to the prior year. This decline in interest rates resulted in lower interest income but also resulted in a decline in interest expense on increased debt balances. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates were 69.7% and 35.6% for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects the effect of the non-deductible impairment charge for our Money Transfer segment. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest, net of tax increased $28.9 million from $8.1 million fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily related to our recent HSBC UK acquisition. Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share During fiscal 2009 we reported net income of $37.2 million ($0.46 diluted earnings per share). New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised) Business Combinations ( FAS 141R ). This statement establishes principles and requirements for how we recognize and measure in our financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. In addition, this standard establishes principles and requirements for how we recognize and measure the goodwill acquired in the business combination or gain from a bargain purchase, and how we determine what information to disclose to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141R will become effective for us for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after June 1, 2009. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements ( FAS 160 ). This statement applies to the accounting for noncontrolling interests (currently referred to as minority interest) in a subsidiary 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. FAS 160 will become effective for us on June 1, 2009. Upon adoption of FAS 160, minority interests that are not redeemable will be reclassified from the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet to permanent equity but separate from parent equity. As further described in Note 13, we have minority interests that include redemption provisions that are not solely within our control, commonly referred to as redeemable minority interests. At the March 12, 2008 meeting of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ), certain revisions were made to EITF Topic No. D-98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities ( Topic D-98 ). These revisions clarified that Topic D-98 applies to redeemable minority interests and requires that its provisions be applied no later than the effective date of FAS 160. Upon adoption of this standard and in conjunction with the provisions of Topic D-98, an adjustment for the then maximum redemption amount of redeemable minority interests will be required. This adjustment will ultimately increase the carrying value of redeemable minority interests to the redemption value with a corresponding charge to equity. These redeemable minority interests will remain in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet. Topic D-98 allows for a choice of either accreting redeemable minority interest to its redemption value over the redemption period or recognizing changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur. We have elected to recognize the changes in the redemption value immediately. We will apply the guidance of Topic D-98 in our consolidated financial statements beginning June 1, 2009, which will result in us recording the maximum redemption amount of our redeemable minority interest with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet. As a result of this guidance, on June 1, 2009 we recorded a $379.6 million increase to minority interest in equity of subsidiaries with a corresponding decrease to retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2007 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2008 and 2007, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2007. 2008 % of Revenue (1) 2007 % of Revenue (1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: United States $ 731,215 57 % $ 604,899 57 % $ 126,316 21 % Canada 267,249 21 224,570 21 42,679 19 North America merchant services 998,464 78 829,469 78 168,995 20 Europe 59,778 5 51,224 5 8,554 17 Asia-Pacific 72,367 6 48,449 5 23,918 49 International merchant services 132,145 10 99,673 9 32,472 33 United States 119,019 9 115,416 11 3,603 3 Europe 24,601 2 16,965 2 7,636 45 Money transfer 143,620 11 132,381 12 11,239 8 Total revenues $ 1,274,229 100 % $ 1,061,523 100 % $ 212,706 20 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 475,612 37.3 % 414,837 39.1 % 60,755 15 Sales, general and administrative 545,941 42.8 425,509 40.1 120,432 28 Restructuring and other 1,317 0.1 3,088 0.3 (1,771 ) (57 ) Operating income $ 251,359 19.7 % $ 218,089 20.5 % $ 33,270 15 % Operating income for segments: North America merchant services $ 275,356 $ 241,082 $ 34,274 14 % International merchant services 17,674 18,588 (914 ) (5 ) Money transfer 13,635 14,476 (841 ) (6 ) Corporate (53,989 ) (52,969 ) (1,020 ) (2 ) Restructuring and other (1,317 ) (3,088 ) 1,771 (57 ) Operating income $ 251,359 $ 218,089 $ 33,270 15 % Operating margin for segments: North America merchant services 27.6 % 29.1 % (1.5 )% International merchant services 13.4 % 18.6 % (5.2 )% Money transfer segment 9.5 % 10.9 % (1.4 )% (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. Revenues We derive our revenues from three primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, and general economic conditions. In fiscal 2008, revenue increased 20% to $1,274.2 million compared to the prior year. We attribute this revenue growth primarily to our merchant services channels. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements North America Merchant Services Segment Revenue from our North America merchant services segment for fiscal 2008 increased by $169.0 million or 20% to compared to the prior year. We have continued to grow our domestic direct merchant channel by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISOs. For fiscal 2008, our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 26% and our revenue grew 21% for this channel compared to the prior year period. In fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year, our domestic direct credit card average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, decreased in the mid single digit percentage range, due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISOs. Offsetting this decline in average ticket was a mid single digit percentage increase in our average discount revenue per dollar value volume, or spread, in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. Our spread was favorably impacted by the shift towards smaller merchants added through our ISOs. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets and higher spreads than larger merchants. Aside from the impact of changes in our average ticket and spread, the remaining difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth was due to our service fees, equipment fees and check-related services. The total of this revenue grew at a lesser rate than our credit and debit card transaction growth. For fiscal 2008, our Canadian direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 3%, with overall Canadian revenue growth of 19% compared to the prior year period. The difference between our transaction growth and revenue growth was primarily due to a favorable Canadian currency exchange rate and a positive impact from changes in the Canadian market interchange structure implemented in April 2008, offset by the unfavorable impact of non-recurring card association incentive revenue realized during fiscal 2007. We experienced continued and expected declines in our domestic indirect and other channel during fiscal 2008, with a decline in revenue of 6% compared to the prior year. We attributed this revenue decline to the industry consolidation of financial institutions and competitive pricing pressures. International Merchant Services Segment Our Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 49% compared to the prior year period. This growth was due to enhancing our sales force, industry expansion and strategic pricing initiatives. Also contributing to the growth is the impact of reporting a full year of results in fiscal 2008 compared to a partial year in fiscal 2007. We completed the purchase of our ownership in HSBC Asia-Pacific merchant acquiring business on July 24, 2006, and began operating in this channel at that time. Our Central and Eastern European merchant services revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 17% compared to the prior year period, largely due to a favorable Czech currency exchange rate, the impact of our Diginet acquisition and growth in credit and debit card processed transactions of 11%. Revenue growth was offset by the loss of a major customer which deconverted at the end of fiscal 2007, in addition to the impact of price reductions granted on contract renewals. Money Transfer Segment For fiscal 2008, revenue from our money transfer segment increased 8% to $143.6 million compared to the prior year. Our domestic money transfer channel relates to all revenue originating from the money transfer branches that we operate in the United States, which may include money transfers to destinations both inside and outside of the United States. For fiscal 2008, our domestic money transfer channel transactions grew 7% and revenue increased 3%, compared to the prior year. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The growth in transactions was driven primarily by same store sales growth and acquired branch locations. We decreased our domestic branch footprint to 793 domestic branches for fiscal 2008, compared to 875 branch locations in fiscal 2007. On a sequential basis, our domestic branch footprint as of May 31, 2008 decreased by 32 locations compared to our domestic branch footprint as of February 29, 2008. This decrease in domestic branches was the result of the closure of underperforming locations, partially offset by branch acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, new branch openings. The difference between our domestic transaction growth and revenue growth was primarily due to lower pricing. Our European money transfer channel relates to all revenue generated from the money transfer branches that we operate in Europe, which may include money transfers to destinations both inside and outside of Europe. In Europe, we increased our branch footprint to 90 locations for fiscal 2008, compared to 68 locations in fiscal 2007, primarily through our acquisition of LFS Spain. For fiscal 2008, our European money transfer revenue grew 45%, primarily due to acquired and new branch locations, which resulted in transaction growth of 34%. Revenues for fiscal 2008 were also impacted by a favorable year-over-year currency exchange rate. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operational-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement; assessments and other fees paid to card associations; transaction processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs of settlement channels for money transfer services; transition services paid to HSBC in the Asia-Pacific market; network telecommunications capability, depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Cost of service increased 15% to $475.6 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service decreased to 37.3% of revenue for fiscal 2008 from 39.1% in fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2008, the decline in cost of service as a percentage of revenue was related to our revenue growth and the related economies of scale benefits. The growth in cost of service expenses was primarily due to the following factors: the addition of our Asia-Pacific channel; costs associated with our money transfer segment; the weakening of the United States dollar compared to the currencies of Canada, the Czech Republic, and Spain; increased losses in our check guarantee service offering; and increases in variable processing expenses associated with our revenue growth, primarily assessment fees paid to card associations. Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management, commissions to independent contractors and ISOs, advertising costs, other selling expenses, share-based compensation expenses and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 28% to $545.9 million compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 42.8% for fiscal 2008 compared to 40.1% in fiscal 2007. The increases in sales, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. The ISO commission model differs from our other sales channels where the commissions are primarily paid for only a twelve-month period. The addition of our new Asia-Pacific channel also contributed to the increases in sales, general and administrative expenses due to the investment in the regional sales force and infrastructure. Lastly, the weakening of the United States dollar compared to the currencies of Canada, the Czech Republic and Spain also increased these expenses. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Offsetting the increases in sales, general and administrative expenses was the favorable impact of a non-recurring, non-cash operating tax item of $7.0 million that was recognized in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we determined that an accrued liability relating to a contingent operating tax matter was no longer deemed to be probable. We made this determination as a result of consultation with outside legal counsel and further analysis of applicable legislation. As such, we released the related liability. Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, management refers to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to the segments operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. North America Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the North America merchant services segment increased 14% to $275.4 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 27.6% and 29.1% for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. This operating margin decline was primarily due to the growth of our ISO channel, increased losses in our check guarantee service offering, and the prior year non-recurring card association incentive revenue in Canada. Offsetting this decline in operating margin was the impact of the operating tax item discussed above. International Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the International merchant services segment decreased 5% to $17.7 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 13.4% and 18.6% for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively This operating margin decline was primarily due to the ongoing investments in our Asia-Pacific channel and the customer attrition and pricing pressure in our Central and Eastern European channel. Money Transfer Segment Operating income in the money transfer segment decreased 6% to $13.6 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. This decrease resulted in an operating margin of 9.5% for fiscal 2008, compared to 10.9% in the prior year. This operating margin decline was primarily due to the increased price competition discussed above and our use of a fixed-cost, branch model at the point of sale. In addition, we incurred costs associated with the closure of underperforming locations, such as lease termination fees and fixed asset write-offs. In contrast with the operating margin decline for the full fiscal 2008 year, recent trends have improved. For the three months ended May 31, 2008, we achieved operating income growth of 116% in this segment compared to the prior year, and our operating margin improved to 18.6% compared to 10.2% in the prior year. These strong results were primarily due to stabilized pricing, the closure of underperforming branch locations, and economies of scale benefits resulting from our fixed cost model. Corporate Our corporate expenses primarily include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, insurance, employee incentive programs, Board of Directors fees, share-based compensation, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. Our corporate costs increased 2% to $54.0 million for fiscal 2008 compared to $53.0 million for fiscal 2007. These increases were primarily due to higher employee incentive program expenses, offset by lower share-based compensation costs. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Restructuring and Other Charges During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we committed to plans to close two locations and consolidate their functions into existing locations, which is consistent with our strategy to leverage infrastructure and consolidate operations. These restructuring plans required staff reduction and facility closure costs and were completed during our second quarter of fiscal 2008. We recorded restructuring charges of $1.3 million in fiscal 2008. We recorded restructuring and other charges of $3.1 million in fiscal 2007. Consolidated Operating Income Consolidated operating income increased 15% to $251.4 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. This change resulted in an operating margin of 19.7% for fiscal 2008 compared to 20.5% in the prior year. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other income and expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense. Interest and other income, net increased to $10.0 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $8.2 million in the prior year. This improvement was largely due to higher interest income due to higher cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes In fiscal 2008, our effective tax rate, reflected as the provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes, including the effect of minority interest, increased to 35.6% from 34.1% in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily due to favorable one-time tax benefit items in the prior year related to income tax statute expirations and certain tax planning initiatives. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest, net of tax decreased to $8.1 million for fiscal 2008 compared to $9.9 million in the prior year. This decrease primarily related to our investment in our Asia-Pacific channel, offset by growth in our Comerica Bank alliance. Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Net income increased 14% to $162.8 million in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. This growth resulted in a 15% increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.01 in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year. Liquidity and Capital Resources At May 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $426.9 million. Of this amount, we consider $115.6 million to be available cash, which generally excludes settlement related and merchant reserve cash balances, as well as cash that belongs to a partnership. At May 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents included $163.6 million related to Merchant reserves. While this cash is not restricted and can be used in our general operations, we do not intend to use it, as we believe that designating this cash to collateralize Merchant reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card associations. See Cash and cash equivalents under Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $110.6 million to $383.0 million for fiscal 2009 from the prior year. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to increased operating income resulting from our acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP. Our net income of $37.2 million included a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and identified intangible assets of $147.7 million, minority interest in earnings of $37.0 million and $30.9 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. In addition to our non-cash adjustments, we had cash provided by changes in working capital of $26.9 million. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The working capital change was primarily due to the change in net settlement processing assets and obligations of $22.4 million, the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $7.9 million, and the change in prepaid expenses and other assets of $8.2 million, partially offset by the change in income taxes payable of $15.8 million. The change in net settlement processing assets and obligations relates to timing differences, processed volume changes and exchange rate fluctuations. See Settlement processing assets and obligations under Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is due to timing differences related to payments versus accruals, primarily relating to ISO commissions, year-end bonus accruals, employee benefits, and third party processing charges. The change in prepaid expenses and other assets is primarily due to net timing differences related to amortization of prepaid assets, prepayments for computer maintenance, and collections of receivables from ISO relating to the sale of merchants and/or residual streams for Discover activity. The change in income taxes payable is attributed to the timing and amount of estimated tax payments this year compared to last year. Net cash used in investing activities increased $496.0 million to $559.3 million in fiscal 2009 from the prior year, primarily due to our $441.6 million investment in a partnership with HSBC UK, our $75.0 million acquisition of all outstanding stock of UCS, and our $10.9 million investment in a partnership with HSBC Asia Pacific. Capital expenditures decreased to $40.9 million in fiscal 2009 from $45.0 million in fiscal 2008. These expenditures primarily relate to software and infrastructure. In fiscal 2009, we generated $161.5 million in cash provided by financing activities compared to $76.4 million cash used in financing activities in the prior year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to our new five year, $200.0 million term loan agreement. In addition, this increase was also due in part to our purchase of $87.0 million in shares of our common stock fiscal 2008, while we did not repurchase any common stock during fiscal 2009. On June 12, 2009, we completed the purchase of the remaining 49% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP (the LLP ) from HSBC Bank plc. Total consideration for the LLP remaining interest was $307.7 million in cash. We used existing lines of credit and available cash to complete the transaction. On July 10, 2009 we entered into a new $300.0 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. We used the proceeds of the term loan to pay down our existing credit facility which was used initially to fund the purchase of the remaining 49% interest in the LLP. The term loan expires in 2012 and has a variable interest rate based on London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on our leverage position. We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. For fiscal 2010, we do not have any material capital commitments, other than commitments under operating leases and planned expansions. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and acquisitions, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. Our current cash flow strategy is, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our growth strategies, to pay dividends, to pay off debt and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our Board of Directors, to collateralize our Merchant reserves, and to invest excess cash in investments that we believe are of high-quality and marketable in the short term. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities Outstanding debt consisted of the following: May 31, 2009 May 31, 2008 (in thousands) Lines of credit: U.S. Credit Facility $ $ China Credit Facility 577 Canada Credit Facility National Bank of Canada ( NBC ) Credit Facility 1,534 71 Macau Credit Facility 1,333 879 Sri Lanka Credit Facility 1,355 Philippines Credit Facility 5,244 Maldives Credit Facility 708 Notes Payable 12,003 Term loan 185,000 Total debt $ 207,177 $ 1,527 Current portion 35,174 1,527 Long-term debt 172,003 Total debt $ 207,177 $ 1,527 Lines of Credit Our line of credit facilities are used to provide a source of working capital and for general corporate purposes, while the U.S. Credit Facility is additionally available to fund future strategic acquisitions.

As of May 31, 2009 the interest rate on the facility was 5.7%. This facility is subject to annual review up to and including June 2010. Term Loan On June 23, 2008, we entered into a five year unsecured $200.0 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks in the United States to partially fund our HSBC Merchant Services acquisition (Note 2). The term loan bears interest, at our election, at the prime rate or LIBOR plus a margin based on our leverage position. As of May 31, 2009 the interest rate on the term loan was 1.43%. The term loan calls for quarterly principal payments of $5.0 million beginning with the quarter ended August 31, 2008 and increasing to $10.0 million beginning with the quarter ending August 31, 2010 and $15.0 million beginning with the quarter ending August 31, 2011. As of May 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of the term loan was $185.0 million. The $5.0 million quarterly principal payment scheduled for May 31, 2009 was paid on June 1, 2009, as the contractual payment due date fell on a weekend. Notes Payable In connection with our acquisition of UCS, we assumed notes payable with a total outstanding balance of approximately $12.0 million at May 31, 2009. These notes are used to fund the purchase of ATMs and have interest rates ranging from 8% to 10.5% with maturity dates ranging from March 31, 2011 through July 25, 2013. Redeemable Minority Interests We have a redeemable minority interest associated with our Asia-Pacific merchant services channel. Global Payments Asia-Pacific, Limited, or GPAP, is the entity through which we conduct our merchant acquiring business in the Asia-Pacific region. We own 56% of GPAP and HSBC Asia Pacific owns the remaining 44%. The GPAP shareholders agreement includes provisions pursuant to which HSBC Asia Pacific may compel us to purchase, at the lesser of fair value or a net revenue multiple, additional GPAP shares from HSBC Asia 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Pacific (the AP Put Option ). HSBC Asia Pacific may exercise the AP Put Option on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition and on each anniversary thereafter. By exercising the AP Put Option, HSBC Asia Pacific can require us to purchase, on an annual basis, up to 15% of the total issued shares of GPAP. While not redeemable until beginning in July 2011, we estimate the maximum total redemption amount of the minority interest under the AP Put Option would be $91.7 million as of May 31, 2009. We also had a redeemable minority interest associated with the HSBC Merchant Services LLP partnership agreement. Under the HSBC Merchant Services LLP partnership agreement, HSBC UK could compel us to purchase, at fair value, additional membership units (the UK Put Option ). HSBC UK could exercise the UK Put Option on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition and on each anniversary thereafter. By exercising the UK Put Option, HSBC UK could require us to purchase, on an annual basis, up to 15% of the total membership units. While not redeemable until June 2013, we estimate the maximum total redemption amount of the minority interest under the UK Put Option would be $307.7 million, as of May 31, 2009. On June 12, 2009 we purchased the remaining 49% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP from HSBC UK. Please see Note 16 Subsequent Events for further information. We adopted the provisions of EITF Topic D-98 beginning June 1, 2009. Topic D-98 requires that redeemable minority interests be recorded at the maximum redemption amount. Pursuant to the adoption of Topic D-98, we recorded a $379.6 million increase to the carrying amount of redeemable minority interests with a corresponding decrease to retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets. The carrying amount of redeemable minority interests was subsequently reduced by $307.7 million on June 12, 2009 when we purchased the remaining 49% of the LLP. Pursuant to FAS 160, the purchase of the remaining 49% of the LLP is reflected as an equity transaction and no additional value has been ascribed to the assets of the LLP. As a result, our tax basis in the LLP exceeds our book basis and we anticipate recording a deferred tax asset in the amount of $97.6 million with a corresponding increase to retained earnings. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under Critical Accounting Estimates below. Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of May 31, 2009: Payments Due by Future Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5+ Years (in thousands) Operating leases (Note 13) $ 39,937 $ 19,703 $ 15,457 $ 3,416 $ 1,361 Long-term debt including current portion (Note 6) 197,003 29,393 106,428 61,182 Interest on long-term debt (1) 3,886 814 2,094 978 (1) Interest on variable rate debt is based on rates effective as of May 31, 2009. Note: This table excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, and other current and long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and the minority interest put option rights described in Note 13. We do not have any material purchase commitments as of May 31, 2009. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We believe that cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business and the satisfaction of these obligations and commitments. Critical Accounting Estimates In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. In many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. The critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in Item 1A Risk Factors of this annual report. Reserve for operating losses As a part of our direct merchant credit card and debit card processing services and check guarantee services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, and the Russian Federation we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which we collectively refer to as operating losses. Merchant losses occur when we are unable to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. Check guarantee losses occur when we are unable to collect the full amount of a guaranteed check from the checkwriter. Please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of these operating losses. We process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. Our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults. We account for our potential liability relating to merchant losses as guarantees. We estimate the fair value of these guarantees by adding a fair value margin to our estimate of losses. This estimate of losses is comprised of known losses and a projection of future losses based on an assumed percentage of our United States, Canadian, the United Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, and the Russian Federation direct merchant credit card and off-line debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume. For the years ended May 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, our processed volume was $231.9 billion, $134.7 billion, and $100.1 billion, respectively. For these same periods, we recorded provisions for merchant losses of $7.1 million, $5.7 million, and $3.1 million, respectively. As a percentage of processed volume, these charges were 0.0031%, 0.0043%, and 0.0031%, respectively, during the above periods. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $6.9 million, $5.2 million, and $3.3 million, respectively. Since actual losses were similar to the merchant loss provisions provided above, we believe that our estimation 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for the year ended May 31, 2009 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.2 million. Further, if our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for our fiscal 2009 had equaled our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume of 0.0043% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decreased by $0.9 million. As of May 31, 2009 and 2008, $3.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, have been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and are included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter bank. We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. Our check guarantee loss reserve is also comprised of known losses and a projection of future losses based on an assumed percentage of the face value of our guaranteed checks. For the years ended May 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, we guaranteed total check face values of $2.5 billion, $2.7 billion, and $2.6 billion, respectively. For those same periods, we recorded provisions for check guarantee losses of $17.9 million, $23.9 million, and $18.2 million, respectively. As a percentage of the total guaranteed check face value, these charges were 0.73%, 0.90%, and 0.70%, respectively, during the years mentioned above. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $17.9 million, $23.0 million, and $18.8 million, respectively. Since actual losses were similar to the check guarantee loss provisions provided above, we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our percentage assumption for the year ended May 31, 2009 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.5 million. Further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2009 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 90% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decrease by $1.2 million. As of May 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a check guarantee reserve of $4.0 million and $6.1 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We derive our projected loss rate assumptions primarily based on a rolling six month analysis of historic loss activity. These assumptions, however, bear the risk of change, which may occur as a result of several qualitative factors. For merchant losses, these factors include the following: a change in the creditworthiness of our merchant customers; a change in the levels of credit card fraud affecting our merchant customers; and a change in the effectiveness of our internal credit, risk management, and collection departments. For check guarantee losses, these factors include a change in the levels of dishonored consumer checks presented to our guarantee service merchant customers and a change in the effectiveness of our internal check guarantee procedures, customer acceptance and retention policies, or collection protocols. Application of our percentage assumptions involve uncertainty regarding changes in any of the factors above, especially those that are outside of our control, such as the financial health of the United States, Canadian, the United Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, and the Russian Federation regional economies at a regional or national level and the related impact on our customers. Goodwill and long-lived asset valuations We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually by applying a fair value based test. Property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may exceed their fair values. When factors indicate that these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment of their carrying values by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment test as of January 1, 2009. Pursuant to the guidance in FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. In the first step the reporting unit carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon, among other factors, a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed. Step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill. The excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss. At May 31, 2009 we had goodwill of $625.1 million recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of our annual impairment test we recorded an impairment charge related to our Money Transfer segment during the three months ended February 28, 2009. Please see Note 3 Impairment Charges for further information. Other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), and trademarks associated with acquisitions. Customer-related intangible assets, contract-based intangible assets and certain trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 30 years. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. The useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets. We have determined that certain trademarks have indefinite lives and they, therefore, are not being amortized. We use the accelerated method of amortization for our customer related intangible assets. In determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. In addition, if the cash flow patterns that we experience are less favorable than our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization schedule accordingly. These cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. During fiscal 2009, we did not adjust the amortization schedules. We believe that our accelerated method better approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. We use the straight-line method of amortization for our contract-based intangibles and amortizable trademarks. Capitalization of Internally Developed Software We develop software that is used in providing processing services to customers. Capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. The preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. Costs incurred prior to the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Currently unforeseen circumstances in software development could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. Costs capitalized during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $11.8 million, $10.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively. Internally developed software has an amortization period of 5 to 10 years. Internally developed software assets are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires management judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we establish liabilities for material tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related liability. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change. Judgment will be required to determine whether or not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets will be adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
