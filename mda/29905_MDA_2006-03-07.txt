Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. It is important that you read SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS inside the front cover of this Annual Report of Form 10-K for more information about these forward-looking statements and their inherent uncertainties and risks. (1) FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Management assesses the Company liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, adequacy of commercial paper and available bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and long-term basis. The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Twelve Months Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 2005 2004 (In thousands) Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 659,571 $ 577,500 Investing activities (1,068,441 ) (520,969 ) Financing activities 272,839 (100,950 ) Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2005 increased $82.1 million, or 14%, compared to 2004, which included a tax refund of approximately $41 million. The increase in cash flows provided by operations reflected higher net earnings and incremental decreases in working capital, which was partially offset by an $18.0 million pension contribution, higher benefits and compensation payouts and an increase in tax payments of approximately $83 million in 2005. Cash used in investing activities during 2005 increased $547.5 million compared to 2004, reflecting an increase in acquisition and capital expenditure activity, partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of businesses and sale of property and equipment. Acquisition expenditures in 2005 were $1,091.8 million compared to $506.1 million in 2004. Capital expenditures in 2005 increased $49.6 million to $152.1 million as compared to $102.5 million in 2004, primarily due to investments in plant expansions, plant machinery and information systems. Proceeds from the disposition of businesses increased $85.4 million to $159.3 million. The Company currently anticipates that any additional acquisitions made during 2006 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, established lines of credit or public debt markets. Capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to increase moderately over 2005 levels. Cash provided by financing activities during 2005 totaled $272.8 million as compared to cash used in financing activities of $101.0 million during 2004. The net change in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a net increase in borrowings of $439.5 million that were used to fund current year acquisitions partially offset by cash used in the repurchase of treasury shares $51.9 million and dividends paid of $133.9 million. Adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure; calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from December 31, 2004 by $16.4 million or 1.3% to $1,292.1 million, primarily driven by increases in receivables of $127.1 million, increases in payables of $56.9 million offset by decreases in inventory of $53.8 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions on working capital of $80.7 million and changes in 17 foreign currency of $49.3 million, working capital decreased by $15.0 million or 3% from December 31, 2004. The increase in receivables was driven by increased revenue activity and acquisitions of $54.0 million, partially offset by decreases due to foreign currency fluctuations of $48.9 million. The inventory balance decrease was driven by operations and decreases due to foreign currency fluctuations of $23.8 million, partially offset by acquisitions of $59.5 million. Increases in accounts payable were a result of a concerted effort by management to better align the payable cycle with the Company cash receipts cycle, acquisitions of $32.8 million, partially offset by a decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations of $23.4 million. In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover common stock. For further information see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $507.5 million or 8.3% of revenue compared to $475.0 million or 9.1% of revenue in the prior year period, which included a tax refund of approximately $41 million in the first quarter of 2004. The 2005 increase in free cash flow reflected higher net earnings and incremental decreases in working capital, which was partially offset by pension contributions of $18.0 million to the Knowles Electronics Holdings, Inc. pension plan, higher benefits and compensation payouts and increased capital expenditures of $49.6 million and tax payments of approximately $83 million. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow with cash flows from operating activities. Twelve Months Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow 2005 2004 (In thousands) Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 659,571 $ 577,500 Less: Capital expenditures (152,113 ) (102,529 ) Free cash flow $ 507,458 $ 474,971 At December 31, 2005, the Company net property, plant, and equipment totaled $816.7 million compared to $727.0 million at the end of 2004. The increase in net property, plant and equipment reflected acquisitions of $100.3 million, capital expenditures of $152.1 million, partially offset by decreases related to foreign currency fluctuation of $22.7 million and depreciation. The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities increased from a $425.9 million net liability at the beginning of the year to $428.2 million at year-end 2005. This resulted primarily from decreases in current tax liabilities, increases in deferred tax assets from accruals and net operating loss carryforwards (primarily acquisition related), partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets. Dover consolidated pension benefit obligation increased by $160.7 million in 2005. The increase was due principally to acquisitions of $96.2 million and actuarial losses related to lower discount rate assumptions. Offsetting this, plan assets increased $111.0 million due to acquisitions of $68.5 million, gains on plan investments during the year and Company contributions of $18.0 million, which were partially offset by the payouts of benefits. During 2005, plan amendments created an increase in the benefit obligation of $9.7 million. Due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans and the increase in the amortization of unrecognized losses, it is estimated that pension expense will increase from $26.7 million to approximately $41 million in 2006. The Company anticipates discretionary contributions to its pension benefit plans of under $25 million in 2006. 18 The Company utilizes the total debt and net debt to total capitalization calculations (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculations are useful to its stockholders for the same reasons. The following table provides a reconciliation of total debt and net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: At December 31, At December 31, Net Debt to Total Capitalization Ratio 2005 2004 (In thousands) Current maturities of long-term debt $ 1,201 $ 252,677 Commercial paper and other short-term debt 193,028 86,588 Long-term debt 1,344,173 753,063 Total debt 1,538,402 1,092,328 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 191,150 329,055 Net debt 1,347,252 763,273 Add: Stockholders equity 3,329,523 3,118,682 Total capitalization $ 4,676,775 $ 3,881,955 Net debt to total capitalization 28.8 % 19.7 % The total debt level of $1,538.4 million as of December 31, 2005 increased $446.1 million from December 31, 2004 as a result of an increase in borrowings to fund acquisitions made in 2005. On October 26, 2005, the Company closed a $1 billion 5-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that replaces the Company $400 million 364-day facility and its 5-year $600 million facility. This facility is primarily used to support the Company commercial paper borrowings and had no outstanding balance at December 31, 2005. In addition, on October 13, 2005, Dover issued $300 million of 4.875% notes due 2015 and $300 million of 5.375% debentures due 2035. The net proceeds from the notes and debentures were used to fund acquisitions. The notes and debentures are redeemable at the option of Dover in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price that includes a make-whole premium, with accrued interest to the redemption date. Also, on November 25, 2005, the Company entered into a 3 year, 75 million credit facility. This facility had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2005. Dover long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,345.4 million on December 31, 2005 and a fair value of approximately $1,406.0 million. On December 31, 2004, the Company long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,005.7 million and a fair value of approximately $1,093.0 million. The Company was in compliance with the covenants related to its debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending may increase Company debt. However, management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the Company various cash flow requirements, including for acquisition spending and capital expenditures. Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the Company liquidity, and the Company is in compliance with all of its long-term debt covenants. It is anticipated that in 2006 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper or, depending upon market conditions, through the issuance of long-term debt or some combination of the two. During the third quarter 2005, Dover entered into several treasury rate locks related to the October 13, 2005 notes and debentures. The contracts were settled on October 13, 2005 and the resulting gain of $3.0 million is being deferred and amortized over the life of the related notes and debentures. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had two interest rate swaps outstanding for a total notional amount of $100.0 million, designated as fair value hedges of the $150.0 million 6.25% Notes due on June 1, 2008. One $50 million interest rate swap exchanged fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest. The other $50 million swap is 19 designated in foreign currency, and exchanges fixed-rate interest for variable-rate interest, and also hedges a portion of the Company net investment in foreign operations. The swap agreements reduced the effective interest rate on the notes to 5.12%. There was no hedge ineffectiveness as of December 31, 2005, and the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps of $0.9 million was determined through market quotation and is reported in other assets and long-term debt. During 2005, the Company entered into derivative contracts to hedge potential foreign currency volatility on current assets and liabilities. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were considered by management to be highly effective. The derivative foreign exchange contracts settled during 2005 and resulted in a gain of approximately $0.6 million, which is recognized in Other (income), expense, net. At December 31, 2005, the Company had open foreign exchange forward purchase contracts expiring through December 2006 related to hedges of foreign currency exposures as follows: U.S. Dollar Euro Average Value Value Contract Rate (In thousands) USD $ 20,733 1.1941 Japanese Yen 264 116.3986 Euro 20,000 0.8065 Swiss Franc 26,000 1.3022 The Company credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, are as follows for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 Short Term Long Term Short Term Long Term Moody P-1 A2 P-1 A1 Standard & Poor A-1 A A-1 A+ Fitch F1 A F1 A+ A summary of the Company undiscounted long-term debt, commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2005 and the years when these obligations come due is as follows: Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter (In thousands) Long-term debt $ 1,345,374 $ 1,201 $ 1,369 $ 149,362 $ 160 $ 1,193,282 Interest expense 1,064,293 79,435 79,435 73,966 70,060 761,397 Rental commitments 139,927 35,271 28,559 20,050 12,702 43,345 Purchase obligations 48,778 46,410 2,220 81 67 Capital leases 16,362 2,013 1,586 1,544 1,529 9,690 Other long-term obligations 7,102 1,363 1,185 799 494 3,261 Total obligations $ 2,621,836 $ 165,693 $ 114,354 $ 245,802 $ 85,012 $ 2,010,975 (2) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenue for 2005 of $6,078.4 million was up $861.3 million or 17% from 2004, primarily driven by increases at all six segments led by $291.7 million at Resources and $147.8 million at Electronics. Resources revenue increased due to positive market fundamentals, acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies. Electronics revenue was impacted by the acquisition of two significant Components companies in the third quarter of 2005 along with operating improvements in the core businesses. 20 Revenue would have increased 16% to $6,066.1 million, if 2004 foreign currency translation rates were applied to 2005 results. Acquisitions completed during 2005 contributed $209.3 million to revenue and contributed operating profit before purchase accounting write-offs of $32.6 million. Gross profit of $2,079.4 million in 2005 represented a 16% increase compared to $1,793.7 million in 2004, while gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 34.2% and 34.4%, respectively. For the year, consolidated revenue growth was 16.5%, with 8.2% from organic growth and 8.1% from acquisitions. Earnings growth of 20% was generated by 13.8% of organic growth, with 6.4% from acquisitions. Selling and administrative expenses for 2005 were $1,378.9 million, or 22.7% of revenue, compared to $1,205.3 million or 23.1% of revenue in 2004. The increase in selling and administrative expenses included increases in compensation and pension benefits along with the impact of the 2005 acquisitions. Operating earnings of $700.5 million for 2005 increased $112.1 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the 17% increase in revenue, benefits from improved operating efficiencies and improved global economic conditions. Operating margin for 2005 and 2004 was essentially flat at 11.5% and 11.3%, respectively. Net interest expense increased 17.8% to $72.2 million for 2005, compared to $61.3 million for 2004. The primary reason for the increase in net interest expense was higher outstanding borrowings used to fund 2005 acquisitions. Other (Income) Expense, net for 2005 of ($15.3) million was driven primarily by foreign exchange gains. Other (Income) Expense, net of ($1.6) million for 2004 included gains on dispositions, favorable settlements and miscellaneous credits of $9.5 million, which were largely offset by foreign exchange losses of $7.9 million. The 2005 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 26.3% compared to 25.4% in 2004 and includes a $9.5 million U.S. tax provision related to the repatriation of $373.7 million of dividends, a $25.5 million benefit primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax issues, and a $5.5 million first quarter benefit related to a favorable federal tax court decision. Excluding the repatriation provision, the full year 2005 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 24.8%. Dover expects the 2006 effective tax rate to be between 28% and 30% for continuing operations. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 were $474.5 million or $2.32 per diluted share compared to $394.2 million or $1.92 per diluted share from continuing operations in 2004. For 2005, net earnings were $510.1 million or $2.50 per diluted share, including $35.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations, compared to $412.8 million or $2.02 per diluted share for 2004, which included $18.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations. Segment Results of Operations Diversified Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 749,083 $ 602,447 24 % Segment earnings 87,290 69,377 26 % Operating margin 11.7 % 11.5 % Bookings 810,205 663,228 22 % Book-to-Bill 1.08 1.10 Backlog 308,587 249,915 23 % Diversified revenue and earnings increases were driven by both the Industrial Equipment Group and the Process Equipment Group due to growth in the aerospace, defense, heat exchanger, and oil and gas markets. Industrial Equipment revenue and earnings increased 27% and 17%, respectively, over the prior year. The revenue increase was driven primarily by strength in the aerospace and construction markets. The margin decrease resulted from unfavorable product mix and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by volume increases and moderating raw material pricing. The automotive and powersports business was down as gains from the North 21 American professional racing market were not enough to offset a weak powersports market. Bookings increased 23%, generating a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08, and backlog increased 22%. Process Equipment full-year revenue and earnings rose 19% and 33%, respectively, and margin grew to over 15%, reflecting double digit revenue growth in all areas, and significant earnings and margin growth in the oil and gas market for bearings. In addition, overall growth was driven by the expanding HVAC markets for heat exchangers, as well as productivity gains. Bookings increased 20%, backlog grew 30%, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.08. Electronics Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 621,569 $ 473,779 31 % Segment earnings 49,311 41,099 20 % Operating margin 7.9 % 8.7 % Bookings 657,903 477,588 38 % Book-to-Bill 1.06 1.01 Backlog 173,078 98,088 76 % The increase in both revenue and earnings at Electronics was primarily driven by the acquisition of two significant Components companies, Knowles Electronics and Colder Products, in the third quarter of 2005 and operating improvements within core businesses, although these gains were partially offset by decreases in Commercial Equipment and purchase accounting amortization. Components operating earnings increased 128% in 2005 compared to the prior year on a 46% increase in revenue, reflecting the impact of the acquisitions, and revenue and earnings growth in almost all of the other Components businesses. The margin grew to exceed 11% and was aided by the two recent acquisitions and included $5.3 million of integration costs related to a 2004 Vectron acquisition, which has essentially been completed. Bookings increased 57%, backlog grew 81%, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.07. Commercial Equipment full year revenue was flat, with earnings down 23% and a substantial decrease in margin, reflecting some market softness and the effect of Hurricane Katrina, which disrupted the ATM operations significantly in the third quarter of 2005. Bookings decreased 2%, backlog grew 23%, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.01. Industries Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 847,345 $ 773,440 10 % Segment earnings 106,080 88,742 20 % Operating margin 12.5 % 11.5 % Bookings 875,323 803,872 9 % Book-to-Bill 1.03 1.04 Backlog 227,079 197,126 15 % Revenue and earnings increases in Industries were driven primarily by the Mobile Equipment group, due to strong military sales and strength in environmental markets. Industries earnings increase was partially offset by a decrease at the Service Equipment group. Bookings and backlog both exceeded prior-year levels on improved strength in the environmental and military markets. Strong military sales and strength in the oil field industry contributed to Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increases of 15% and 45%, respectively, with significant margin improvement. Earnings were also positively impacted by a gain of approximately $1 million on the sale of a facility and cost control initiatives. Bookings increased 14% driven by strong demand for trailer and refuse products, generating a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 and a backlog increase of 15%. 22 Service Equipment revenue and margin were flat while earnings declined moderately, reflecting overall end market conditions and weakness in the automotive service industry. Earnings were negatively impacted by product mix, new product introduction costs, and a facility shutdown. Bookings were essentially flat, backlog increased 18% and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.01. Resources Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,579,312 $ 1,287,587 23 % Segment earnings 264,346 206,462 28 % Operating margin 16.7 % 16.0 % Bookings 1,611,623 1,345,737 20 % Book-to-Bill 1.02 1.05 Backlog 191,422 160,978 19 % In 2005, Resources had record revenue, earnings, margin, bookings and backlog, reflecting positive market fundamentals, acquisitions and improved operating efficiencies. Oil and Gas Equipment led the segment in 2005 with increases in revenue and earnings of 52% and 62%, respectively, due to continued robust demand for its energy-related products. Bookings increased by 49%, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03 and backlog increased 58%. Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings increased 14% and 20%, respectively, due to strong refining, petrochemical, and transportation markets, partially offset by weakness in the retail petroleum markets. Bookings were up 12%, and backlog was up 6%, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01. Material Handling realized an increase in revenue of 14% while earnings, which included strategic realignment costs at one of the businesses grew 6%. The increase in revenue was driven by demand in the construction, crane, aerial lift, petroleum, and military markets, partially offset by slow demand from the automotive industry. Bookings were up 11%, and backlog was up 20%, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03. Systems Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 705,377 $ 619,434 14 % Segment earnings 100,088 73,479 36 % Operating margin 14.2 % 11.9 % Bookings 755,436 654,053 16 % Book-to-Bill 1.07 1.06 Backlog 174,402 124,908 40 % Systems revenue and earnings increases were driven by both Food Equipment and Packaging Equipment, reflecting strength in the supermarket equipment and can machinery markets. Food Equipment revenue increased 14% in 2005 compared to the prior year, due to higher supermarket and foodservice equipment sales, resulting in an earnings increase of 42%. Margin improved due to volume leverage, pricing initiatives and productivity gains. Bookings increased 13%, and backlog was up 26%, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05. Packaging Equipment revenue and earnings in 2005 increased 13% and 18%, respectively, over the prior year and margin rose 80 bps due to strength in the can machinery market, particularly in Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East, driven by both new lines and can size conversions. The package closure business experienced continued weak market conditions in Western Europe, particularly Germany. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.14, bookings increased 22% and backlog increased 89%. 23 Technologies Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,586,576 $ 1,469,902 8 % Segment earnings 163,663 159,586 3 % Operating margin 10.3 % 10.9 % Bookings 1,632,805 1,453,204 12 % Book-to-Bill 1.03 0.99 Backlog 203,255 165,746 23 % Revenue and earnings increases in 2005 reflected strength in the product identification market, offset by costs of $8 million related to restructuring charges that are expected to have a positive impact on the segment future financial performance. CAT revenue was essentially flat and earnings declined 24% in 2005 compared to the prior year, reflecting restructuring charges of approximately $6 million, principally related to certain facility closures, and general sales declines, except at the screen printer and wave solder companies. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.04, bookings increased 4% and backlog increased 32%. Product Identification and Printing ( PIP ) reported a revenue increase of 31%, while earnings increased 22%. The revenue and earnings increases were primarily attributable to the impact of the Datamax acquisition at the end of 2004, partially offset by approximately $2 million of restructuring costs, weakness in printing equipment markets and price competitiveness for marking equipment. The book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.01, bookings increased 31% and backlog increased 5%. 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenue for 2004 of $5,217.1 million was up $1,050.9 million or 25% from 2003, primarily driven by increases of $367.3 million at Technologies and $350.3 million at Resources. Technologies revenue was impacted by positive trends in the global electronics industry, particularly in the back-end semiconductor market, as well as expansion of the Chinese manufacturing capacity. Resources revenue increased due to improved market conditions and the full year impact of the 2003 acquisition of Warn Industries. Revenue would have increased 22% to $5,097.1 million if 2003 foreign currency translation rates were applied to 2004 results. Acquisitions completed during 2004 contributed $104.1 million to revenue and contributed gross profit of $38.6 million. Gross profit of $1,793.7 million in 2004 represented a 26% increase compared to $1,426.3 million in 2003. The gross profit margin was essentially flat for both 2004 and 2003 at 34.4% and 34.2% as volume increases in 2004 were offset by rising commodity prices. Selling and administrative expenses for 2004 were $1,205.3 million or 23.1% of revenue, compared to $1,003.2 million or 24.1% of revenue in 2003. The increase in selling and administrative expenses included the costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley requirements and increases in compensation and pension benefits. Operating earnings of $588.3 million for 2004 increased $165.3 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the 25% increase in revenue, benefits from the Company restructuring programs undertaken during 2002 and 2001, and slightly improved global economic conditions. Operating margin for 2004 was 11.3% compared to 10.2% for 2003. Net interest expense decreased 2% to $61.3 million for 2004, compared to $62.3 million for 2003. The primary reason for the decrease in net interest expense was income related to the Company outstanding interest rate swaps related to a portion of its long-term debt. Other (Income) Expense, net, for 2004 was ($1.6) million and includes gains on dispositions, favorable settlements and miscellaneous credits of $9.5 million, which were largely offset by foreign exchange losses of $7.9 million. Other (Income) Expense, net, of $9.7 million for 2003 primarily related to foreign exchange losses of 24 $6.2 million. The foreign exchange losses in both 2004 and 2003 primarily relate to the appreciation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Dover effective 2004 tax rate for continuing operations was 25.4% compared to the 2003 rate of 23.0%. The low effective tax rate for both years is largely due to the continuing benefit from tax credit programs such as those for research and experimentation combined with the benefit from U.S. export programs, lower effective foreign tax rates from the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and the recognition of certain capital loss benefits, which were higher in 2003. Earnings from continuing operations for 2004 were $394.2 million or $1.92 per diluted share compared to $270.1 million or $1.33 per diluted share from continuing operations in 2003. For 2004, net earnings were $412.8 million or $2.02 per diluted share, including $18.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations, compared to $292.9 million or $1.44 per diluted share for 2003, which included $22.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share in earnings from discontinued operations. Refer to Note 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations.

Industrial Equipment revenue and earnings increased 23% and 34%, respectively, primarily due to the continued recovery of the commercial and defense aerospace markets, increased cab sales volumes with key customers in the construction/agriculture equipment markets, and the recovery of the automotive racing and powersports markets. Solid execution of performance improvement plans as well as the addition of new customers and improved operating efficiencies all contributed to the earnings and margin increases. Bookings increased 32%, generating a book-to-bill ratio of 1.12, and backlog increased 33%. Process Equipment revenue increased 15%, while earnings increased 21%, primarily due to the addition of new key customers for its color and ink control products, moving its customer base from small and medium size printers in the aftermarket to large printers and the high-end new press OEM market. In the heat pump and boiler markets, order activity was steady throughout the year, and production capacity was increased with both capital investments and productivity programs to meet the growing demand. Cost reduction activities and favorable currency rates also contributed to the earnings and margin increases. Bookings increased 23%, generating a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07, and backlog increased 33%. 25 Electronics Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 473,779 $ 367,671 29 % Segment earnings 41,099 31,870 29 % Operating margin 8.7 % 8.7 % Bookings 477,588 374,397 28 % Book-to-Bill 1.01 1.02 Backlog 98,088 73,499 33 % Electronics revenue and earnings growth in 2004 was primarily due to increases in the ATM business and the impact of acquisitions on the Components group. Components revenue and earnings increases of 30% and 61%, respectively, were primarily due to acquisitions made at the end of 2003 and during 2004 as well as stronger demand from communication equipment customers, which peaked in the second quarter of 2004. Bookings increased 27% over the 2003 period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.00, and backlog increased 30%. Commercial equipment revenue and earnings increased 26% and 16%, respectively, primarily due to increases in the ATM business in 2004, which marked the transition from serving primarily low-end retail ATM markets to entering the mid to high-end market of major retail and financial institutions. Costs associated with these endeavors reduced margin. Orders finished strong with a bookings increase of 29%, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02, and backlog increased 97%, primarily due to strong demand in the ATM business. Industries Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 773,440 $ 646,301 20 % Segment earnings 88,742 70,916 25 % Operating margin 11.5 % 11.0 % Bookings 803,872 723,311 11 % Book-to-Bill 1.04 1.12 Backlog 197,126 163,115 21 % Industries revenue and earnings increases reflected continued market share gains helped by considerable new product introductions in the Mobile Equipment group, which was the largest contributor to the revenue and earnings increases. Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings were up 23% and 42%, respectively, over the prior year due to an increase in buying in municipal markets, increases in market share within the national account segment, and further penetration into the independent hauler segment. Recycling products had a strong year as baler sales increased behind new product introductions and product redesigns. The Mobile Equipment group increased its market share due in part to a large one-time order from a national account, by leveraging its broad product line, and by focusing engineering efforts on identifying customer needs. Bookings increased 10% over the 2003 period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06, and backlog increased 21%. Service Equipment revenue increased 15%, while earnings increased 7%. Much of the increase in revenue was due to new lower margin product categories introduced in the latter half of 2003. Earnings were also hampered by escalating steel costs and pricing pressures from low-cost Asian car wash imports. Sales to major oil companies were up for the year, but investor sales were flat as hurricanes and heavy rain reduced near-term car wash volume and, therefore, made current investors reconsider their replacement and expansion plans for the year. Bookings increased 14% over the 2003 period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01, and backlog increased 19%. 26 Resources Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,287,587 $ 937,336 37 % Segment earnings 206,462 129,395 60 % Operating margin 16.0 % 13.8 % Bookings 1,345,737 943,792 43 % Book-to-Bill 1.05 1.01 Backlog 160,978 101,282 59 % Resources 2004 revenue increased 37% while earnings increased 60%, driven by strength in the Oil and Gas Equipment group and in the Material Handling group, which serves the construction equipment, mobile crane, recovery vehicle, and power sports markets. Oil and Gas Equipment revenue increased 31% primarily due to an acquisition, as well as organic growth. Earnings increased 36% due to increased volume and strong gas compression and transmission markets in 2004, both in the OEM equipment and the maintenance and service sectors. Bookings increased 38% over the 2003 period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04, and backlog increased 212%. Fluid Solutions 2004 revenue and earnings increased 14% and 30% respectively, when compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase in retail service station construction and remodeling, the opening of a new manufacturing facility in China, an expanded presence in Brazil, and stronger growth in the rail tank car market. The group earnings benefited from restructuring and consolidation initiatives in 2003, generating strong earnings leverage as a result of these initiatives. Bookings increased 15% over the 2003 period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03, and backlog increased 37%. Material Handling revenue and earnings increased 79% and 113%, respectively, which includes the results of Warn Industries, which was acquired in October 2003. The group achieved record revenue in power sports products, strong growth in its branded truck products, and continued growth in powertrain products driven by increased demand for light trucks and sport utility vehicles. Also, strong growth was achieved in robotics tooling and through major industrial catalog sales. These strengths were dampened by slow growth in the automotive tooling and work holding markets. The petroleum, military, construction equipment, and mobile crane markets rebounded in early 2004 and provided increased opportunities for growth and the business has been able to realize synergy in sales and engineering from prior acquisitions. Orders finished strong with a bookings increase of 89%, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06, and backlog increased 61%. Systems Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 619,434 $ 619,498 0 % Segment earnings 73,479 85,721 14 % Operating margin 11.9 % 13.8 % Bookings 654,053 583,448 12 % Book-to-Bill 1.06 0.94 Backlog 124,908 89,617 39 % Systems 2004 revenue was flat while 2004 earnings decreased by 14% primarily due to weakness in the Food Equipment Group, which experienced slower market conditions and a rise in commodity costs. Food Equipment revenue was essentially flat while earnings decreased 18%. Continued weakness in municipal spending negatively impacted the institutional equipment market for the third consecutive year. 2004 saw numerous chain restaurant new-store openings being delayed or put on hold. Despite slower overall market conditions and consolidations in the supermarket industry, revenue continued to grow through expansion of its customer base by 27 offering industry-leading product innovations and strong customer service. In addition, the group was heavily impacted by the rise in commodity costs, and a slowdown in new construction and remodels by two of its major customers. Bookings increased 11% over the 2003 period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06, and backlog increased 37%. Packaging equipment revenue increased 4%, while earnings were essentially flat. Despite weakness in the German market and the result of a consolidating retail environment, international sales were strong driven by strength in Eastern Europe, primarily Russia, Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Baltic states. The U.S. business moderately increased amid continued pricing pressures. Earnings were negatively impacted by investments in product development, start-up costs associated with opening a new facility in the Czech Republic, and increases in commodity costs. Bookings increased 15% over the 2003 period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05, and backlog increased 48%. Technologies Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,469,902 $ 1,102,617 33 % Segment earnings 159,586 82,644 93 % Operating margin 10.9 % 7.5 % Bookings 1,453,204 1,132,677 28 % Book-to-Bill 0.99 1.03 Backlog 165,746 147,829 12 % Technologies revenue and earnings increases were due primarily to the continued recovery of the overall electronics industry, which commenced in 2003. Particularly strong was the mid-year activity in the back-end semiconductor markets. However, by the fourth quarter, the semiconductor and related markets had slowed significantly as did the level of Chinese contract manufacturers capital expenditures. CAT experienced 42% revenue growth and 159% earnings growth in 2004 compared to 2003. Most of this growth came from the companies serving the back-end semiconductor markets and from new technology requirements in solder paste management and soldering. In addition, the group acquired a test handling company Rasco GmbH in June 2004, which contributed to the overall growth in revenue and earnings. Revenue was also positively impacted by increased sales of circuit assembly feeders and strong market acceptance of selective soldering machines, and product breadth that addresses the specific needs of the North American, European and Asian markets. The memory, chip attach and special application segments also contributed to the revenue and earnings growth. Bookings increased 33% over the 2003 period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98, and backlog increased 3%. PIP reported a 17% increase in revenue and a 15% increase in earnings primarily due to its CIJ applications in primary packaging, and DOD and TTOL applications in secondary packaging and large character printing. CIJ unit volume for the year was at a record level although non-CIJ products were becoming an increasing percentage of the group business. In addition, during December, the group completed the acquisition of Datamax International, a Florida-based manufacturer of bar code printers, which was immaterial to the revenue and earnings of the group in 2004 due to the timing of the acquisition. In addition, the group experienced significant growth in label press orders, driven by the strength of the Euro, U.S. tax incentives and improvements in sales strategies. Bookings increased 18% over the 2003 period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01, and backlog increased 36%. Critical Accounting Policies The Company consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the Company, including information regarding 28 contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include the following areas: Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectibility is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving non-essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed. Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Though Dover considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the Company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required. Inventory for the majority of the Company subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries and the Technologies segment, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly value inventory. Technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines (including SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Dover assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to the valuations. The valuation of Dover pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dover pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for Dover future pension obligations. Changes 29 in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on Dover pension expenses and related funding requirements. Dover expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Dover discount rate assumption is determined by constructing a portfolio of bonds to match the expected benefit stream to be paid from the Company pension plans. The benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities, as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio. Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the Company future taxable income levels. Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, Dover experience, and relevant industry data. Dover considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and Company experience. Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify Dover ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues. While Dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. The Company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs to sell. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. New Accounting Standards Effective January, 1 2006, Dover adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123(R) ), which no longer permits the use of the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion ( APB ) No. 25. Dover adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all options granted after January 1, 2006, as well as the unvested portion of previously granted options. Compensation expense will be recorded on a straight line basis, generally over the explicit service period (3 years). For retirement eligible employees, SFAS No. 123(R) clarifies that the recognition of compensation expense should be over the period from the date of grant through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service. Dover accounting policy related to vesting will be changed to reflect these rules for retirement eligible employees concurrent with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ( SFAS 154 ), which replaces APB No. 20 Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3 Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle, and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles, as well as changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that it does not include specific transition provisions. Specifically, SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods 30 financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 does not change the transition provisions of any existing pronouncement. SFAS 154 is effective for Dover for all accounting changes and corrections of errors made beginning January 1, 2006. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ( FIN 47 ), effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. FIN 47 clarifies that a conditional asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 is effective for the Company no later than the end of 2005. The effect of FIN 47 was immaterial to Dover consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, An Amendment of APB No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions ( SFAS 153 ). The amendments made by SFAS 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The statement was effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2005 and was applied prospectively. The effect of the adoption of SFAS 153 was immaterial to Dover consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4 ( SFAS 151 ). SFAS 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. The provisions of SFAS 151 are applicable to inventory costs incurred beginning January 1, 2006. The effect of the adoption of SFAS 151 was immaterial to Dover consolidated results of operations, cash flow and financial position. Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company results as determined by GAAP, the Company also discloses non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, total capitalization, operational working capital, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, revenue and working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to total capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the Company capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis. Management believes that reporting operational working capital (also sometimes called adjusted working capital ), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. In addition, management believes that reporting operational working capital and revenue at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational changes, given the global nature of Dover businesses. Management also believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of the Company revenue performance and trends between periods.
