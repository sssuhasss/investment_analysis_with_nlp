Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. YEAR IN REVIEW Our 2012 consolidated pretax income was $514 million compared to $394 million in 2011 . The $120 million improvement was primarily due to the $339 million increase in revenues, partially offset by the $161 million increase in aircraft fuel expense and $95 million increase in other operating expenses. Our improvement in revenues was primarily due to a 7.9% increase in traffic and a 0.7% increase in yield. The increase in fuel cost was driven by the 2.2% increase in raw cost per gallon on a 6.0% increase in consumption. See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Accomplishments and Highlights Accomplishments and highlights from 2012 include: Reported record adjusted earnings for 2012 , marking our ninth consecutive year in which we reported an adjusted profit. Air Group employees earned $88 million in incentive pay, or more than one-month's pay for most employees. Over the last four years, employees have earned more than $325 million in incentive pay, averaging 8% of annual pay for most employees. Signed an aircraft purchase agreement with The Boeing Company for 50 new 737 aircraft, including 37 of Boeing's new 737 MAX aircraft with deliveries expected in 2015 through 2022. Improved employee productivity by 3.5 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Carried a record number passengers in 2012 and achieved a record load factor of 85.9 percent , up 1.4 points from the prior year. Completed renovation of Terminal 6 at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in March, which includes the Airport of the Future design, new common use systems, additional gates and convenient connections with international flights. 23 Table of Contents Repurchased 1,685,951 shares of common stock for approximately $60 million . Since 2007, Air Group has used $320 million to repurchase 18 million shares. Lowered adjusted debt-to-total capitalization ratio by 8 points to 54 percent since December 31, 2011 and by 27 points from 81 percent at the end of 2008. Held $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2012. Achieved trailing twelve-month return on invested capital of 13 percent , surpassing the 10 percent goal for the third year in a row. Contributed $110 million to the defined-benefit pension plans during 2012, bringing the total over four years to approximately $540 million, despite having no required contribution.

Delta will add a flight between Seattle and Shanghai beginning in June 2013 and is proposing a flight between Seattle and Tokyo-Haneda to begin in March 2013. Through our existing codeshare partnership, Delta is able to connect passengers to more than 50 destinations on the Alaska route network via Seattle. Increasing international flow traffic will help support Alaska's continued capacity expansion in Seattle and beyond. In December 2012, we announced a new code-sharing and frequent flier agreement with Aeromexico. The new agreement will allow Aeromexico and our customers the ability to connect across 45 cities around Mexico and 11 countries in Central and South America. We also announced enhanced frequent flier awards benefits with Emirates, allowing members to redeem awards for travel on each others' programs in addition to earning miles on a reciprocal basis as established when the partnership began in March 2012. In February 2013, we announced an expansion of the existing code-share agreement with American Airlines, allowing passengers from both carriers greater access to their combined route networks. New American code on our northern California to Hawaii flights will continue to support our growth in these markets. American passengers will also find greater access to new mid- and trans-continental flights on us, helping build brand awareness and demand in many of our newest destinations. Additionally, we will code-share on 19 more American routes, including 13 new destinations to which our customers will be able to book travel through alaskaair.com. 25 Table of Contents Update on Labor Negotiations In July 2012, our ramp and stores agents, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), ratified a six-year contract by a 91% margin before the amendable date. The contract provides for an initial wage increase of 2.5% followed by 1.5% annual increases over the six-year term, and contains important productivity improvements. It also offers both the Company and our employees the certainty that comes with a long-term deal. In December 2012, we entered into a six-year agreement with Horizon's pilot union, represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), for an extension of their contract through December 2018. The deal is mutually beneficial to both the company and our pilots and calls for a signing bonus, wage step increases and productivity gains over the term of the contract. We also ratified a three-year agreement with Horizon's station personnel in Vancouver and Victoria, represented by the National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers, in January 2013. We are currently in negotiations with Alaska's and Horizon's flight attendants, represented by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), whose contracts became amendable in April 2012 and December 2011, respectively. In addition, we are in early discussions with Alaska's pilots, represented by the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA), whose contract is amendable in April 2013. We are also in negotiations with Horizon's maintenance store employees, represented by IAM. Stock Repurchase In 2012, we repurchased 1,685,951 shares of our common stock for $60 million under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors. Since 2007, we have repurchased 18 million shares of common stock under such programs for $320 million for an average price of approximately $17 per share. Outlook Our primary focus every year is to run safe, compliant and reliable operations at our airlines. In addition to our primary objective, we will remain focused on providing a hassle-free experience for our customers. Specifically, we plan to enhance mobile features and expand our self-bag tagging capabilities. Additionally, as part of our strategy of enhancing our brand, we are considering ways to enhance the onboard experience, such as seats, cabin layout, seat power, and in-flight entertainment. Our biggest concerns going forward are increased competition in our markets, particularly low-cost competitors, and our unsigned labor agreements. Our goal is to sign labor agreements prior to the amendable date to to avoid the negative impacts of prolonged negotiations and provide our employees with the long-term stability that helps promote higher customer satisfaction. To combat low-cost competitors, we took delivery of four B737-900ER aircraft in 2012 and will take delivery of an additional nine in 2013, which will provide additional efficiencies in fuel consumption and overall unit cost reductions. Our advance bookings suggest our load factors will be up 0.5 pts in February and flat in March compared to the same periods in 2012 on an expected 8.5% increase in capacity for the first quarter of 2013 . RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2012 COMPARED WITH 2011 Our consolidated net income for 2012 was $316 million , or $4.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $245 million , or $3.33 per diluted share, in 2011 . Significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows: Both periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our fuel hedge positions. For 2012 , we recognized net mark-to-market losses of $38 million ( $23 million after tax, or $0.33 per share) compared to losses of $30 million ( $18 million after tax, or $0.26 per share) in 2011 . In 2011, we incurred $39 million ( $24 million after tax, of $0.33 per share) in expense as part of Horizon's fleet transition to an all Q400 fleet. ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS We believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because: We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts; 26 Table of Contents Our results excluding these items are most often used in internal management and board reporting and decision-making; Our results excluding these adjustments serve as the basis for our various employee incentive plans, thus the information allows investors to better understand the changes in variable incentive pay expense in our consolidated statements of operations; It is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves a reader ability to compare our results to those of other airlines; and It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases. Although we are presenting these non-GAAP amounts for the reasons above, investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual in nature. Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments and other special charges, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2012 was $339 million , or $4.73 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $287 million , or $3.92 per share, in 2011 .

The changes are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 3,284 $ 2,995 10 Regional 746 713 5 Total passenger revenue $ 4,030 $ 3,708 9 Freight and mail 111 109 2 Other - net 516 501 3 Total operating revenues $ 4,657 $ 4,318 8 Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2012 increased by 10% on a 6.3% increase in capacity and a 3.2% increase in PRASM compared to 2011 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes added in 2012 , most of which were to and from Hawaii. The increase in PRASM was driven by a 1.4% increase in ticket yield and a 1.4-point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The increase in yield is due to strong demand throughout the year, while the increase in load factor is due to adding more traffic in our high density markets. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $33 million , or 5% , compared to 2011 on a 4.4% increase in capacity and flat PRASM compared to 2011 . PRASM was affected by a 1.1% decrease in ticket yield, offset by a 1.2-point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The decrease in yield is due to increased competition in certain markets, while the increase in load factor is due to better matching of supply with demand. Freight and Mail Freight and mail revenue increased $2 million , or 2% , primarily due to higher freight volumes and an increase in fuel and security surcharges, which offset a decrease in mail volumes. Other Net Other net revenue increased $15 million , or 3% , from 2011 . This is primarily due to an increase in our Mileage Plan revenues of 7% and buy-on-board sales of 20% . Buy-on-board improved due to an increase in food sales of 24% and beverage sales of 14% . These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bag fees of 2% due to general shifts in customer behavior and our Club 49 program that launched in the fourth quarter of 2011, which waives the checked bag fee for residents in the state of Alaska who have joined the program. OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $256 million , or 7% , compared to 2011 mostly as a result of higher fuel costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 % Change Fuel expense $ 1,459 $ 1,298 12 Non-fuel expenses 2,666 2,571 4 Total Operating Expenses $ 4,125 $ 3,869 7 Significant operating expense variances from 2011 are more fully described below. 29 Table of Contents Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2012 by $47 million , or 5% , compared to 2011 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 % Change Wages $ 726 $ 703 3 Pension and defined-contribution retirement benefits 103 88 17 Medical benefits 109 108 1 Other benefits and payroll taxes 100 92 9 Total wages and benefits $ 1,038 $ 991 5 Wages increased 3% on a 1% increase in FTEs as a result of increased flying and higher wage rates throughout our different employee groups which have wage step increase in their contracts. The contracts with the different employee groups contain important productivity improvements, which resulted in a 3.5% increase in the number of passengers handled per FTE. Pension and other retirement-related benefits increased 17% primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate on the future benefit obligation compared to the prior year. The impact of lower rates resulted in an increase in our pension expense. Medical benefits increased 1% from the prior year primarily due to an increase in employee health-care claims, partially offset by a decline in post-retirement medical expense. Other benefits and payroll taxes increased 9% from the prior year due to increased workers' compensation expense of $4 million as a result of higher loss rates in more recent claim years and increased stock-based compensation of $4 million . We expect wages and benefits to be 6% to 7% higher in 2013 compared to 2012 on a 3% to 4% increase in FTEs, as well as inflation in medical benefits of 10%. Pension and other retirement-related benefits is expected to be flat compared to 2012 . Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased from $72 million in 2011 to $88 million in 2012 . The increase is due to actual results exceeding our target results of financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year. If we meet targets established under our Performance Based Pay and Operational Performance Rewards programs, we expect variable incentive pay will be approximately $60 million in 2013 . If we exceed the targets, variable incentive pay will be higher. If we do not achieve targets, it will be lower. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. 30 Table of Contents Aircraft fuel expense increased $161 million , or 12% compared to 2011 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,397 $ 3.31 $ 1,289 $ 3.24 (Gains) losses on settled hedges 24 0.06 (21 ) (0.06 ) Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,421 $ 3.37 $ 1,268 $ 3.18 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments 38 0.09 30 0.08 GAAP fuel expense $ 1,459 $ 3.46 $ 1,298 $ 3.26 Fuel gallons 422 398 Fuel gallons consumed increased 6.0% in line with the increase in departures and block hours. The raw fuel price per gallon increased 2.2% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil, as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2012 was due to the increase in refining margins of 10.3% , offset by the decrease in crude oil of 1.3% , as compared to the prior year. We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from, or pay to, hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense, we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year was $24 million in 2012 , compared to gains of $21 million in 2011 . These amounts represent the cash received net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges. We currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 3% higher in the first quarter of 2013 than the first quarter of 2012 due to the increased premium costs related to our fuel hedge program. As both oil prices and refining margins are volatile, we are unable to forecast the full-year cost with any certainty. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance increased by $16 million , or 8% , compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $13 million increase in unscheduled engine removals for our Q400 aircraft and an $8 million increase related to our 737-800 aircraft related to heavier airframe checks, offset by a $12 million decrease due to lighter airframe checks for our 737-400 aircraft. We expect aircraft maintenance to be approximately 10% higher in 2013 due to an increase in lease return costs and scheduled maintenance events for our B737 aircraft, offset by lower maintenance costs for our Q400 aircraft. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent was flat compared to the prior-year period primarily due to lower rent expense for 13 fewer CRJ 700 aircraft of $3 million and three B737-400 aircraft lease extensions of $2 million , offset by additional rent expense for three B737-700 aircraft which were sold and leased back of $3 million . We expect aircraft rent to be flat in 2013 as we intend to return six B737 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2013. 31 Table of Contents Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $5 million , or 2% , primarily due to higher facilities rents of $5 million and increased landing fees of $4 million due to increased departures of 1.8% . These increases were partially offset by lower rents at LAX of $8 million . We expect landing fees and other rentals to be slightly higher in 2013 due to an expected increase in departures. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $15 million , or 8% , primarily due to an increase in passengers of 4.5% and capacity purchase flying of $13 million related to SkyWest, which began in May 2011. Additionally, we experienced higher passenger and ramp handling of $2 million as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where outside vendors are used. We expect contracted services to be higher in 2013 to handle expected growth in the number of passengers. Selling Expenses Selling expenses decreased by $7 million , or 4% , compared to 2011 as a result of lower fees related to debit card purchases of $4 million and flat global distribution system (GDS) fees, offset by an increase in advertising and promotional activities of $2 million . We expect selling expense will be higher in 2013 , primarily due to increased advertising and promotional activities and revenue related costs, such as credit card commissions. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $17 million , or 7% , compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to additional depreciation expense for the annualization of B737 aircraft and Q400 aircraft delivered in 2011, as well as the deliveries of B737 aircraft in 2012. In addition, we incurred depreciation of $6 million since we placed Terminal 6 at LAX into service in March 2012. These increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation expense for the CRJ 700 aircraft removed from the fleet in 2011 and other assets that became fully depreciated or were removed from operation. We expect depreciation and amortization to be higher in 2013 in line with our nine aircraft deliveries and the annualization of seven aircraft deliveries in 2012. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage costs increased $12 million , or 18% , from the prior year due to an increased number of passengers of 4.5% , increase in sales of buy-on-board products of 20% , the higher cost of some of our premium products served on board, and increased costs associated with food delivery. We expect food and beverage costs to be higher in 2013 due to an anticipated increase in sales in line with an expected increase in the number of passengers. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $13 million , or 6% , compared to 2011 . The increase is primarily driven by higher IT and professional service costs of $8 million associated with our key initiatives and infrastructure improvements, and higher personnel non-wage costs such as hotels, meals and per diems of $7 million . We expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2013 due to an expected increase in IT spending of approximately $20 million and higher professional service costs. Fleet Transition and Restructuring Related Expenses Fleet transition costs decreased $39 million , as we completed our transition to an all-Q400 fleet at Horizon in 2011. 32 Table of Contents Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile Our operating costs per ASM (CASM) are summarized below: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 % Change Consolidated: Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 13.12 13.06 0.5 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 4.64 4.38 5.9 Fleet transition costs 0.13 NM CASM, excluding fuel and fleet transition costs 8.48 8.55 (0.8 ) Mainline: Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 12.09 11.87 1.9 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 4.53 4.27 6.1 CASM, excluding fuel 7.56 7.60 (0.5 ) NM - Not Meaningful We have listed separately in the above table our fuel costs per ASM and our unit costs, excluding fuel and other noted items. These amounts are included in CASM, but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our cost-reduction progress. We believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons: By eliminating fuel expense and certain special items from our unit cost metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. CASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our plan documents) is an important metric for the employee incentive plan that covers all employees. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as fleet transition costs, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our passenger unit revenues, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. 33 Table of Contents Our current expectations for capacity and operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Forecast Q1 2013 Change Y-O-Y Forecast Full Year 2013 Change Y-O-Y Consolidated: Capacity (ASMs in millions) 7,950 - 8,000 ~ 8.5% 33,600 - 34,100 ~ 7.5% Cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items (cents) 8.79 - 8.84 flat 8.35 - 8.40 ~ (1)% Mainline: Capacity (ASMs in millions) 7,150 - 7,200 ~ 9% 30,150 - 30,650 ~ 8% Cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items (cents) 7.88 - 7.93 flat 7.50 - 7.55 ~ (0.5)% CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense decreased $37 million from 2011 . This is due to lower interest expense of $13 million on lower average outstanding debt balances and additional capitalized interest due to higher levels of aircraft purchase deposits and capital expenditures. Additionally, we incurred pre-payment penalties of $8 million and an impairment charge of $6 million on an owned aircraft that was leased to another carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection in the prior year. The decrease was partially offset by lower interest income earned on our marketable securities portfolio. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our effective income tax rate for 2012 was 38.5% compared to 37.9% for 2011 . The difference between the effective tax rates and our statutory tax rate of approximately 37.5% is due primarily to miscellaneous non-deductible expenses. Our effective tax rate can vary significantly between quarters and for the full year, depending on the magnitude of non-deductible expenses in proportion to pretax results. 2011 COMPARED WITH 2010 Our consolidated net income for 2011 was $245 million , or $3.33 per diluted share, compared to net income of $251 million , or $3.41 per diluted share, in 2010 . Significant items impacting the comparability between the periods were as follows: Both periods included adjustments to reflect the timing of net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our fuel hedge positions. For 2011 , we recognized net mark-to-market losses of $30 million ( $18 million after tax, or $0.26 per share) compared to losses of $5 million ( $4 million after tax, or $0.05 per share) in 2010 . 2011 included Horizon fleet transition costs of $39 million ( $24 million after tax, of $0.33 per share) compared to $13 million ( $8 million , or $0.11 per share) in 2010 . Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments and other special charges, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2011 was $287 million , or $3.92 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $263 million , or $3.57 per share, in 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 (in millions, except per share amounts) Dollars Diluted EPS Dollars Diluted EPS Net income and diluted EPS as reported $ 245 $ 3.33 $ 251 $ 3.41 Fleet transition costs, net of tax 24 0.33 8 0.11 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, net of tax 18 0.26 4 0.05 Non-GAAP adjusted income and per share amounts $ 287 $ 3.92 $ 263 $ 3.57 34 Table of Contents OPERATING REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $486 million , or 13% , during 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 . The changes are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 2,995 $ 2,595 15 Regional 713 671 6 Total passenger revenue $ 3,708 $ 3,266 14 Freight and mail 109 106 2 Other - net 501 460 9 Total operating revenues $ 4,318 $ 3,832 13 Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2011 increased by 15% on an 8.5% increase in capacity and a 6.2% increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) compared to 2010 . The increase in capacity was driven by the annualization of new routes added in 2010 and new routes in 2011 , most of which was Hawaii. The increase in PRASM was driven by a 4.0% rise in ticket yield and a 1.9-point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The increase in yield was due to an increase in prices to help offset the 36% increase in raw fuel costs. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $42 million , or 6% , compared to 2010 on a 12.8% increase in PRASM compared to 2010 , despite a 5.8% decline in capacity. The increase in PRASM was driven by an 8.1% increase in ticket yield and a 3.2-point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The decline in capacity and increase in load factors was due to better matching supply with demand in the regional network. Freight and Mail Freight and mail revenue increased $3 million , or 2% , primarily due to freight fuel surcharge increases of $5 million offset by lower mail revenue on lower volume. Other Net Other-net revenue increased $41 million , or 9% , from 2010 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in our Mileage Plan revenues of $12 million with higher commissions driven by a larger number of miles sold to our affinity card partner and a contractual rate increase for those sold miles. Additionally, food and beverages sales increased $4 million due to increased volumes. OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $508 million , or 15% , compared to 2010 mostly as a result of significantly higher fuel costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Fuel expense $ 1,298 $ 901 44 Non-fuel expenses 2,571 2,460 5 Total Operating Expenses $ 3,869 $ 3,361 15 Significant operating expense variances from 2010 are more fully described below. 35 Table of Contents Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2011 by $30 million , or 3% , compared to 2010 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Wages $ 703 $ 674 4 Pension and defined-contribution retirement benefits 88 93 (5 ) Medical benefits 108 109 (1 ) Other benefits and payroll taxes 92 85 8 Total wages and benefits $ 991 $ 961 3 Wages increased 4% on a 1.2% increase in FTEs as a result of increased flying, higher wage rates, and a signing bonus to Alaska's clerical, office and passenger service employees in connection with a new contract ratified in January 2011. Productivity as measured by the number of passengers per FTE increased 5% compared to 2010 . Pension and other retirement-related benefits decreased 5% primarily due to a reduction in our defined-benefit pension cost driven by the improved funded status at the end of 2010 as compared to the previous year, partially offset by a slight increase in defined-contribution expense. Medical benefits decreased 1% from the prior year primarily due to a decline in employee healthcare claims, partially offset by an increase in post-retirement medical expense. Other benefits and payroll taxes increased 8% from the prior year due to increases in our Workers Compensation and Disability Plan as well as increased payroll taxes in line with increased wages. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense decreased from $92 million in 2010 to $72 million in 2011 . The decrease was due to the fact that in 2010 our financial and operational results exceeded targets more so than in 2011 . Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense increased $397 million , or 44% compared to 2010 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,289 $ 3.24 $ 899 $ 2.38 Gains on settled hedges (21 ) (0.06 ) (3 ) (0.01 ) Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,268 $ 3.18 $ 896 $ 2.37 Mark-to-mark fuel hedge adjustments 30 0.08 5 0.01 GAAP fuel expense $ 1,298 $ 3.26 $ 901 $ 2.38 Fuel gallons 398 377 Fuel gallons consumed increased 5.6%, primarily as a result of a 5% increase in block hours and a slight increase in fuel burn per block hour as a result of higher load factors. The raw fuel price per gallon increased 36.1% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices. The average prices of crude oil and refining margins during 2011 were higher by approximately 19% and 141% respectively, as compared to 2010 . Gains recognized for hedges that settled during the year was $21 million in 2011 , compared to gains of $3 million in 2010 . 36 Table of Contents Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance decreased by $11 million , or 5% , compared to the prior year primarily due to lower costs associated with the return of leased aircraft and lower costs due to the phaseout of the CRJ fleet, offset by increased airframe check costs and components. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent decreased $23 million , or 16% , compared to the prior-year period primarily due to $14 million less rent related to 11 fewer CRJ 700 aircraft and $6 million less rent related to five fewer B737 aircraft leased in 2011 compared to 2010 . Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $5 million , or 2% , primarily due to a $4 million increase in facilities rents across our network and a $2 million increase in our landing fee expenses. Mainline landing fee expenses increased due to a 9% increase in departures, partially offset by a 10% decrease in our regional departures. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $22 million , or 14% , primarily due to an increase in capacity purchased flying of $13 million compared to the prior year as the new agreement with SkyWest began in May 2011. Additionally, we experienced higher passenger handling of $3 million as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where vendors are used and an increase in contract labor of $2 million. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $21 million , or 14% , compared to 2010 as a result of higher travel agent and ticket distribution costs of $11 million and credit card commissions of $6 million due to increased revenues of 13%. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $17 million , or 7% , compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to additional depreciation expense of $18 million for B737 aircraft, $7 million increase in Q400 aircraft depreciation, offset by a decrease of $4 million in CRJ 700 aircraft and other assets that became fully depreciated or were removed from operation. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage costs increased $10 million , or 17% , from the prior year due to an increased number of passengers, increased sales of buy on board products, a higher cost of some of our fresh food items served on board, and increased costs associated with food delivery. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $34 million , or 17% , compared to 2010 . The increase is primarily driven by higher personnel non-wage costs such as hotels, meals and per diems of $8 million and higher professional service costs of $7 million as well as higher costs for communications, property taxes, passenger remunerations, and deicing. Fleet Transition and Restructuring Related Expenses Fleet transition costs increased $26 million , as we finalized our transition to an all-Q400 fleet. The increase was directly due to net charges of $28 million related to the removal of the CRJ-700 aircraft and related inventory and a loss on the final disposition of Q200 aircraft of $11 million in 2011 . 37 Table of Contents Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 % Change Consolidated: Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 13.06 12.12 7.8 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 4.38 3.25 34.8 Fleet transition costs 0.13 0.05 NM CASM, excluding fuel and fleet transition costs 8.55 8.82 (3.1 ) Mainline: Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 11.87 10.96 8.3 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 4.27 3.11 37.3 CASM, excluding fuel 7.60 7.85 (3.2 ) NM - Not Meaningful CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense was $55 million in 2011 compared to $65 million in 2010 . The $10 million decrease is due to lower interest expense due to payments on maturing debt and prepayments of debt in 2011, higher capitalized interest due to higher levels of capital expenditures, offset by lower investment returns in our marketable securities portfolio, and an impairment charge of $6 million on an owned aircraft that was leased to another carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection, and other-than-temporary-impairments on mortgage-backed securities. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our effective income tax rate for 2011 was 37.9% , compared to 38.1% for 2010 . The difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our statutory tax rate of approximately 37.8% is due primarily to miscellaneous non-deductible expenses, such as per diems. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are: Our existing cash and marketable securities balance of $1.3 billion , which represents 27% of trailing 12 months' revenue, and our expected cash from operations; Our 45 unencumbered aircraft as of December 31, 2012 in our operating fleet that could be financed, if necessary; Our combined $200 million bank line-of-credit facilities, with currently none outstanding; In 2012 , we took free and clear delivery of four B737-900ER, three B737-800 aircraft, and two Q400 aircraft. We paid off outstanding debt associated with seven aircraft totaling $103 million and made scheduled debt payments totaling $172 million . In addition, we continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing $60 million of our common stock in 2012 , which included stock repurchases under a new $250 million program authorized by the Board in September 2012 . Finally, we made voluntary contributions to our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $110 million in 2012 , although there were no funding requirements. We will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change. The overall strength of our balance sheet was one of the contributing factors for Standard & Poor's recent decision to change our outlook from "Stable" to "Positive" in 2012. 38 Table of Contents We believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in securities that meet our overall investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal. Our investment portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives, approved and prohibited investments, and duration and credit quality guidelines. Our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. As of December 31, 2012 , we had a $12 million unrealized gain on our $1.3 billion cash and marketable securities balance. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity: (in millions, except per share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Change Cash and marketable securities $ 1,252 $ 1,141 $ 111 Cash and marketable securities as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue 27 % 26 % 1 pt Long-term debt, net of current portion 871 1,099 (228 ) Shareholders equity 1,421 1,174 247 Long-term debt-to-capital assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent 54%:46% 62%:38% (8 ) pts The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $753 million in 2012, compared to $696 million in the prior year. The $57 million increase was primarily driven by $339 million in increased revenue, offset by higher fuel of $161 million and higher non-fuel operating costs to support increased revenues and capacity. Also, cash received from the sale of miles under our mileage plan program increased approximately $30 million due a 5% increase in miles sold with a 4% increase in rate. In addition, we made voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan of $110 million versus $133 million in the prior year, and we paid cash taxes of $78 million in the current year compared to $8 million in 2011. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $645 million during 2012 , compared to $403 million in 2011 . Our capital expenditures were $518 million , or $131 million higher than in 2011 . This is due to the delivery of four B737-900ER aircraft, three B737-800 aircraft and two Q400 aircraft, compared to three B737-800 aircraft in the prior year, as well as purchase deposits for the nine B737-900ER aircraft to be delivered next year and initial deposits related to our new Boeing agreements. In 2012, we entered into a new agreement and modified existing agreements with Boeing to acquire 50 737 aircraft, including 37 of Boeing's new 737 MAX aircraft. This order positions Alaska to replace aging aircraft over the next decade, including the phase out of nearly all of its 737-400 aircraft by the end of 2017, and continue to operate one of the most modern, environmentally friendly, comfortable and fuel-efficient fleets in the United States. We now have firm commitments for 71 B737 aircraft through 2022 with options to acquire up to 69 additional 737 NextGen (NG) aircraft and MAX aircraft in 2015 through 2024 . The options for both NG and MAX aircraft will give Alaska the flexibility, but not the obligation, to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met. The new agreements will result in increased capital spending over the next ten years depending on how many of our options are exercised. 39 Table of Contents The table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised. These options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be meet: 2012 Actuals 2013 2014 2015 2016 Aircraft and aircraft purchase deposits - firm $ 455 $ 330 $ 285 $ 230 $ 180 Other flight equipment 24 45 50 25 25 Other property and equipment 39 85 85 75 75 Total property and equipment additions $ 518 $ 460 $ 420 $ 330 $ 280 Aircraft and aircraft deposits related to Alaska options, if exercised (a) $ $ 35 $ 185 $ 480 $ 340 Aircraft and aircraft deposits related to Horizon options, if exercised (a) $ $ 75 $ 105 $ 50 $ (a) Alaska has options to acquire 69 B737 aircraft with deliveries in 2015 through 2024 . Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400 aircraft with deliveries in 2013 to 2015 . In addition, our capital expenditures related to Terminal 6 at Los Angeles International Airports (LAX) were lower by $53 million, as we placed the assets constructed for others into service in March. For financial reporting purposes, this asset will remain on our balance sheet as we did not qualify for sale accounting due to our continuing involvement with the facility. Over the last two years we have been reimbursed $182 million, which is classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Cash Used by Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $88 million during 2012 , compared to $281 million in the prior year. During the current year, we had scheduled debt payments of $172 million , debt prepayments of $103 million , and stock repurchases of $60 million , partially offset by proceeds of $49 million related to three B737-700 sale-leasebacks. In addition, we received reimbursement from Los Angeles World Airport (LAWA) for our construction of Terminal 6 at LAX of $178 million . We plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand, along with additional debt financing if necessary. Bank Line-of-Credit Facility The Company has two $100 million credit facilities. Both facilities have variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus a specified margin. Borrowings on one of the $100 million facilities, which expires in August 2015 , are secured by aircraft. Borrowings on the other $100 million facility are secured by certain accounts receivable, spare engines, spare parts and ground service equipment. We modified the first facility in 2012 by extending the term from March 2013 to August 2015 and the second facility in 2011 by extending the term from March 2014 to March 2016 , and reduced the commitment fee for both facilities. The Company has no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Aircraft Purchase Commitments Overall, we have firm orders to purchase 71 aircraft. We have options to acquire 69 additional B737 aircraft and options to acquire 10 Q400 aircraft. The following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments by year: Actual Fleet Count Expected Fleet Activity Aircraft Dec 31, 2011 Dec 31, 2012 2013 Changes Dec 31, 2013 2014 Changes Dec 31, 2014 B737 Freighters & Combis 6 6 6 (3 ) 3 B737 Passenger Aircraft 111 118 3 121 121 Total Mainline Fleet 117 124 3 127 (3 ) 124 Q400 48 48 48 48 Total 165 172 3 175 (3 ) 172 40 Table of Contents We expect to pay for the firm future aircraft deliveries in 2013 with cash on hand. For future firm orders and if we exercise our options for additional deliveries, we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash, long-term debt, or lease arrangements. Future Fuel Hedge Positions We use both call options for crude oil futures and swap agreements for jet fuel refining margins to hedge against price volatility of future jet fuel consumption. We have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50% of our first quarter 2013 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 89 cents per gallon. Our crude oil positions are as follows: Approximate % of Expected Fuel Requirements Weighted-Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Average Premium Cost per Barrel First Quarter 2013 50% $98 $12 Second Quarter 2013 50% $99 $12 Third Quarter 2013 50% $101 $11 Fourth Quarter 2013 50% $102 $10 Full Year 2013 50% $100 $11 First Quarter 2014 44% $102 $10 Second Quarter 2014 39% $102 $10 Third Quarter 2014 33% $101 $9 Fourth Quarter 2014 27% $103 $8 Full Year 2014 35% $102 $10 First Quarter 2015 22% $103 $8 Second Quarter 2015 17% $101 $7 Third Quarter 2015 11% $105 $7 Fourth Quarter 2015 6% $106 $7 Full Year 2015 14% $103 $7 Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2012 . (in millions) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Beyond 2017 Total Current and long-term debt obligations $ 161 $ 117 $ 113 $ 111 $ 116 $ 414 $ 1,032 Operating lease commitments (a) 189 168 135 104 69 209 874 Aircraft purchase commitments 372 332 254 204 322 1,488 2,972 Interest obligations (b) 50 42 37 31 26 44 230 Other obligations (c) 49 44 27 18 19 8 165 Total $ 821 $ 703 $ 566 $ 468 $ 552 $ 2,163 $ 5,273 (a) Operating lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. (b) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2012 . (c) Includes minimum obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreements and obligations associated with third-party CPAs with SkyWest and PenAir. Refer to the "Commitments" note in the consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension Obligations The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, which we estimate to be $35 million to $50 million per year, although there are no minimum required contributions. The unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $335 million at December 31, 2012 compared to $306 million at December 31, 2011 . This results in an 82% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 81% funded as of December 31, 2011 . 41 Table of Contents Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. Under another such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed. Deferred Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the majority of our assets are fully depreciated over a seven-year life using an accelerated depreciation method. For financial reporting purposes, the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 20 years to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line basis. This difference has created a significant deferred tax liability. At some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse, potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid. While it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future, we cannot estimate the timing of long-term cash flows with reasonable accuracy. Taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items, including the amount of book income generated, which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices, level of pension funding (which is generally not known until late each year), whether "bonus depreciation" provisions are available, as well as other legislative changes that are out of our control. In 2012 , we made tax payments of $78 million . In 2013 , if we have similar financial performance our cash taxes may be significantly more due to utilization of federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credits in 2012 . However, this is highly dependent on actual taxable income and other factors that are difficult to estimate at this time. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. MILEAGE PLAN Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners. Additionally, we sell miles to third parties, such as our bank partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future. For miles sold to third parties, a portion of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided. The commission component of these sales proceeds (defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer) is recorded as other-net revenue in the period that miles are sold. This represents services provided by the Company to its business partners and relates primarily to the use of the Company's logo and trademarks along with access to the Company's Mileage Plan members. Commission revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $143 million , $138 million and $124 million , respectively. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2012 , we had approximately 131 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $730 million . Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that 42 Table of Contents require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in estimates; therefore, an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles: We defer an amount that represents our estimate of the selling price of award travel by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel. As our estimates of selling price change, the amount we defer changes, resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given period. A 1% increase in the estimated selling price of travel (and related deferral rate) would decrease commission revenue by approximately $3 million. This amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place. 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): The liability for outstanding Mileage Plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award. Our estimates of the number of miles that will not be redeemed (breakage) consider historical activity in our members accounts and other factors. A hypothetical 1% change in our estimate of breakage (currently 12% in the aggregate) has approximately an $8 million effect on the liability. 3. The number of miles used per award: We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical travel redemption patterns. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on our airlines versus other airlines: The cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel: When a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We regularly review significant Mileage Plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. PENSION PLANS Accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income. Pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $57 million , $42 million , and $50 million in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively. We expect the 2013 expense to be approximately $50 million . 43 Table of Contents The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2012 , we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 7.25% , which is consistent with the expected rate at December 31, 2011 . This rate was developed using historical data, the current value of the underlying assets, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2012 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities and U.S. fixed-income securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by 0.50% (from 7.25% to 6.75% ) would increase our estimated 2013 pension expense by approximately $8 million . Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced. We discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 3.95% and 4.65% at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The discount rate at December 31, 2012 was determined using current rates earned on high-quality long-term bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 3.95% to 3.45% ) would increase our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2012 by approximately $142 million and increase estimated 2013 pension expense by approximately $11 million . All of our defined-benefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants. Additionally, benefits in our non-union defined-benefit plans will be frozen January 1, 2014. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. LONG-LIVED ASSETS As of December 31, 2012 , we had approximately $3.6 billion of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft.
