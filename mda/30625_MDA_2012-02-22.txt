ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Forward-Looking Statements section therein for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. 24 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our Company We believe that we are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products and services add value. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of Quick Response Centers ("QRCs"), we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. We currently employ approximately 16,000 employees in more than 50 countries. Our business model is significantly influenced by the capital spending of global infrastructure industries for the placement of new products into service and aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes. Over the past several years, we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings, as well as to provide business stability during various economic periods. The aftermarket business, which is served by our network of 171 QRCs located around the globe, provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value-added services, and is generally a higher margin business and a key component of our profitable growth strategy. Our operations are conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"): FSG Engineered Product Division ("EPD") for long lead-time, custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; FSG Industrial Product Division ("IPD") for pre-configured engineered pumps and pump systems and related products and services; and Flow Control Division ("FCD") for engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators and controls and related services. Our business segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a high number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications which provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively. The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, Valtek, Limitorque and Durametallic, which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. Our products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world leading engineering, procurement and construction firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. We continue to build on our geographic breadth through our QRC network with the goal to be positioned as near to our customers as possible for service and support throughout the product life cycle in order to capture this important aftermarket business. Along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell, install and service our equipment in remote regions, it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations. We continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products. We continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands. We continue to focus on improving on-time delivery and quality, while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations, through the assistance of a focused Continuous Improvement Process ("CIP") initiative. The goal of the CIP initiative, which includes lean manufacturing, six sigma business management strategy and value engineering, is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. We experienced improved demand for original equipment in 2011 as compared with 2010. As the effects from the global recession began to diminish, several demand forecasts improved, which promoted increased capital investment spending and planning. The oil and gas industry saw improved conditions as the developing regions economic growth plans rekindled projections of demand growth for oil and natural gas. Pipeline and refining investments were driven by infrastructure expansion plans in these growing regions. The developing regions also experienced improved conditions in the investment in chemical processing and general industries. In the mature regions, all three of these industries experienced a moderate increase in levels of investment, although overcapacity in oil refining affected capital investments. In the area of power generation, uncertainty over environmental 25 Table of Contents regulations challenged spending levels, while the water management industry displayed weakness in its spending levels, as planned desalination projects continue to be delayed as governments evaluated fiscal priorities. A critical component of our growth strategy remains our investment in expanding our aftermarket capabilities to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings, as well as to provide stability for our business during various economic periods. In 2011, we experienced improved demand in our global aftermarket business as compared with 2010. This was driven by our customers need to maintain continuing operations and the expansion of our aftermarket capabilities provided through our new integrated solutions offerings. Customers desire to gain operational efficiencies and increase throughput from existing facilities provided opportunities to leverage our engineering knowledge and technological capabilities to design solutions that produce the desired business result. In 2011, we continued to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all regions of our global market to capture aftermarket opportunities. We believe that with our customer relationships, our global presence and our highly regarded technical capabilities, we will continue to have opportunities in our core industries; however, we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multi-national presence, such as economic, political, currency and other risks. Our Markets The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the "Outlook for 2012" section included in this MD&A. Our products and services are used in several distinct industries: oil and gas; chemical; power generation; water management; and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as "general industries." Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of new capital investment depends, in turn, on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas, power generation and water management, as well as general economic conditions. These drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior. The levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment, planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process. Our customers include engineering, procurement and construction firms, original equipment manufacturers, end users and distributors. Sales to engineering, procurement and construction firms and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications, as are certain sales to distributors. Project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects. The quick turnaround business, which we also refer to as "book and ship," is defined as orders that are received from the customer (booked) and shipped within three months of receipt. These orders are typically for more standardized, general purpose products, parts or services. Each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business. In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from a large installed base of our original equipment, which requires maintenance, repair and replacement parts. We use our manufacturing platform and global network of QRCs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. In geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response, we believe customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products. However, the aftermarket for standard products is competitive, as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products. As proximity of service centers, timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services, we continue to expand our global QRC network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business. Oil and Gas The oil and gas industry, which represented approximately 40% and 42% of our bookings in 2011 and 2010, respectively, experienced a stable level of capital spending in 2011 compared to the previous year due to the need to continue building infrastructure in order to bring future capacity on line to meet future demand expectations. The majority of investment by the major oil companies continued to focus on upstream production activities; however, there were improved levels of spending in both mid-stream pipeline and downstream refining operations, particularly in the developing markets. Refining overcapacity remained a concern throughout the year in the mature regions, as overall demand for oil remained volatile throughout the year. Aftermarket opportunities in this industry improved throughout the year, with our integrated solutions offering helping to offset a reduction in service-related business, as many refineries performed this work with their own personnel. The outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies. We believe oil and gas companies will continue with upstream and downstream investment plans that are in line with projections of future demand growth and the production declines of existing operations. A projected decline in demand could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of spending, which could decrease demand for our products and services. 26 Table of Contents However, we believe the long-term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on current supply, projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth. With our long-standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream, mid-stream and downstream applications, along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to pursue the opportunities in this industry around the globe. Chemical The chemical industry represented approximately 18% and 16% of our bookings in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Capital spending in the chemical industry rebounded in 2011 with the expansion of existing facilities and the approval of new projects around the world. The Middle East and Asia have seen significant growth in chemical projects as countries in those regions try to access the higher margins available downstream in the petrochemical markets. Additionally, North America has seen a revival in the chemical industry, where shale gas has changed the economics of production allowing for a lower cost abundant feedstock to drive high value chemical projects. The aftermarket opportunities improved for the majority of the year with indications that the improvements will continue into 2012. Despite a strong year, the outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions. As global economies stabilize and unemployment conditions improve, a rise in consumer spending should follow. An increase in spending would drive greater demand for chemical-based products supporting improved levels of capital investment. We believe the chemical industry in the near-term will continue to invest in maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will continue investing in capital infrastructure to meet current and future indigenous demand. We believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well-positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry. Power Generation The power generation industry represented approximately 16% and 17% of our bookings in 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, the power generation industry continued to experience some softness in capital spending in the mature regions driven by the uncertainty related to environmental regulations, as well as potential regulatory impacts to the overall civilian nuclear market. In the developing regions, capital investment remained in place driven by increased demand forecasts for electricity in countries such as China and India. Global concerns about the environment continue to support an increase in desired future capacity from renewable energy sources. The majority of the active and planned construction throughout 2011 continued to utilize designs based on fossil fuels. Natural gas increased its percentage of utilization driven by market prices for gas remaining low and relatively stable. With the potential of unconventional sources of gas, such as shale gas, the power generation industry is forecasting an increased use of this form of fuel for power generation plants. We believe the outlook for the power generation industry remains favorable. Current legislative efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have an adverse effect on investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country. However, we believe that proposed methods of limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services. We believe the long-term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth, advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets. We also believe that our long-standing reputation in the power generation industry, our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods, our advancements in serving the renewable energy market and carbon capture methodologies, as well as our global service and support structure, position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry. Water Management The water management industry represented approximately 4% and 5% of our bookings in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Although the water management industry displayed weakness in spending levels in 2011 as desalination projects continued to be delayed, worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems, many of which require products that we offer, particularly pumps. We believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continuing investments. The water management industry is facing a future supply/demand challenge relative to forecasted global population growth coupled with the advancement of industrialization and urbanization. Due to the limitations of usable fresh water around the globe, there continues to be an increased investment in desalination. This investment is forecasted to significantly increase over the next several decades. We believe we are a global leader in the desalination market, which is already an important source of fresh water in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. We expect that this trend in desalination will expand from these traditional areas to other coastal areas around the globe, which we believe presents a significant market opportunity for pumps, valves, actuation products and energy recovery devices. 27 Table of Contents General Industries General industries comprises a variety of different businesses, including mining and ore processing, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, none of which individually represented more than 5% of total bookings in 2011 and 2010. General industries also includes sales to distributors, whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve. General industries represented, in the aggregate, approximately 22% and 20% of our bookings in 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, we saw improving conditions in the majority of these businesses. Pulp and paper, mining and ore processing and food and beverage all saw improved conditions in 2011 compared with 2010. This was generally supported by the improving economic conditions in several parts of the world. We also experienced increased business levels through our distribution network, as business conditions improved and inventory levels required replenishment. The outlook for this group of industries is heavily dependent upon the condition of global economies and consumer confidence levels. The long-term fundamentals of many of these industries remain sound as many of the products produced by these industries are common staples of industrialized and urbanized economies. We believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide future business opportunities. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion of our results of operations, we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have calculated currency effects by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods. As discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 ("Annual Report"), ongoing political and economic conditions in North Africa have caused us to experience shipment delays to this region. We estimate that the shipments to this region that have been delayed resulted in lost or delayed opportunities for operating income of $11.2 million ($8.0 million for EPD and $3.2 million for IPD) for 2011 . The preponderance of our physical assets in the region are located in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and have, to date, not been significantly affected by the unrest elsewhere in the region. We continue to assess the conditions and potential adverse impacts of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in early 2011, in particular as they relate to our customers and suppliers in the impacted regions, as well as announced and potential regulatory impacts to the global nuclear power market. During 2011 , we did not experience any significant adverse impacts due to shipment delays, collection issues or supply chain disruptions related to these events. We are also closely monitoring the effects of the Japan crisis on the global nuclear power industry. While it is difficult to estimate the long-term effect of the Fukushima plant shutdown on the global nuclear power market, we have continued to ship nuclear orders in our backlog without significant disruption. We believe that there has been a related reduction in nuclear orders that could continue in the near term, though other parts of our overall power generation business could benefit as nuclear power priorities are reevaluated. Other than broad, macro-level economic impacts, we did not experience any direct or measurable disruptions in 2011 due to the European sovereign debt crisis. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of any future developments in the region on our current business, our customers and suppliers and the state of the global economy. Additional adverse developments could potentially impact our customers exposures to sovereign and non-sovereign European debt and could soften the level of capital investment and demand for our products and services. As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, effective October 28, 2011, we acquired for inclusion in EPD, Lawrence Pumps, Inc. ("LPI"), a privately-owned, United States ("U.S.") based company specializing in the design, development and manufacture of engineered centrifugal slurry pumps for critical services within the petroleum refining, petrochemical, pulp and paper and energy markets. LPI was acquired in a cash transaction valued at $89.6 million , subject to final adjustments. We acquired for inclusion in FCD, Valbart Srl ("Valbart"), a privately-owned Italian valve manufacturer, effective July 16, 2010. We acquired for inclusion in EPD, Calder AG ("Calder"), a Swiss supplier of energy recovery technology, effective April 21, 2009. The results of operations of LPI, Valbart and Calder have been consolidated since the respective dates of acquisition. No pro forma information has been provided for these acquisitions due to immateriality. As discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, beginning in 2009, we initiated realignment programs to reduce and optimize certain non-strategic manufacturing facilities and our overall cost structure by improving our operating efficiency, reducing redundancies, maximizing global consistency and driving improved financial performance, as well as expanding our efforts to optimize assets, respond to reduced orders and drive an enhanced customer-facing organization ("Realignment Programs"). These programs are substantially complete. We currently expect total Realignment Program charges will be approximately $93 million for approved plans, of which $91.2 million has been incurred through December 31, 2011 . 28 Table of Contents Charges, net of adjustments, related to our Realignment Programs were $4.8 million, $18.3 million and $68.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. IPD incurred $4.8 million, $8.9 million and $11.3 million of realignment charges, net of adjustments, for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 respectively. FCD incurred $0.1 million, $6.2 million and $11.5 million of realignment charges, net of adjustments, for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 respectively. EPD incurred $0.2 million, $1.7 million and $42.4 million of realignment charges, net of adjustments, for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 respectively. "Eliminations and All Other" incurred a $0.3 million adjustment due to changes in estimates for the year ended December 31, 2011, and $1.5 million and $2.9 million of realignment charges, net of adjustments, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Based on actions under our Realignment Programs, for the year ended December 31, 2011 we realized approximately $24 million of additional savings compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 , and we expect to realize annual run rate savings in 2012 and beyond of approximately $120 million. Approximately two-thirds of savings from the Realignment Programs were and will be realized in cost of sales ("COS") and the remainder in selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A"). Actual savings realized could vary from expected savings, which represent management's best estimate to date. In addition, in connection with our previously announced IPD recovery plan, in the second quarter of 2011 we initiated new activities to optimize structural parts of IPD's business. We expect charges related to this program to be non-restructuring in nature and will approximate $9 million, of which $7.2 million was incurred in 2011 with the substantial majority recorded in COS. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Outlook for 2012 section included in this MD&A. Bookings and Backlog 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 4,661.9 $ 4,228.9 $ 3,885.3 Backlog (at period end) 2,690.1 2,594.7 2,371.2 We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer with regard to manufacture, service or support. Bookings recorded and subsequently canceled within the year-to-date period are excluded from year-to-date bookings. Bookings in 2011 increased by $433.0 million, or 10.2% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $149 million. The increase was primarily attributable to increased original equipment bookings in FCD and IPD, coupled with increased aftermarket bookings in EPD. These increases were partially offset by decreased original equipment bookings in EPD, including the impact of an order in excess of $80 million to supply a variety of pumps for a refinery, received primarily in the first quarter of 2011, as well as the impact of an order in excess of $80 million for crude oil pumps, seals and related support services booked in 2010 that did not recur. The increase was also attributable to strength in the oil and gas and chemical industries in FCD, general industries in both FCD and IPD and power generation and chemical industries in EPD, partially offset by a decrease in the oil and gas industry in EPD. Bookings in 2010 increased by $343.6 million, or 8.8%, as compared with 2009. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $12 million. The overall net increase was primarily attributable to increased original equipment and aftermarket bookings in EPD, principally in the oil and gas industry, including the impact of an order in excess of $80 million for crude oil pumps, seals and related support services received in the second quarter of 2010. The increase is also attributed to higher bookings in FCD, driven by the oil and gas and general industries. These increases were partially offset by the impact of orders of more than $45 million to supply valves to four Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear power units booked in 2009 that did not recur and decreased original equipment bookings in IPD. Backlog represents the accumulation of uncompleted customer orders. Backlog of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2011 increased by $95.4 million, or 3.7% , as compared to December 31, 2010 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $51 million (currency effects on backlog are calculated using the change in period end exchange rates). Approximately 24% of the backlog at December 31, 2011 was related to aftermarket orders. Backlog of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2010 increased by $223.5 million, or 9.4%, as compared to December 31, 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $51 million. 29 Table of Contents Sales 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions) Sales $ 4,510.2 $ 4,032.0 $ 4,365.3 Sales in 2011 increased by $478.2 million, or 11.9% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $144 million. The increase was primarily due to FCD, which had increased original equipment sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMA"), reflecting continued recovery in the oil and gas industry and increased sales attributable to Valbart of $74.6 million. Aftermarket sales in EPD, driven by North America and Latin America, also contributed to the overall increase in sales and were partially offset by decreased original equipment sales in EPD, primarily in EMA. North America sales in IPD also contributed to the overall increase, primarily driven by original equipment. Sales in 2010 decreased by $333.3 million, or 7.6%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $32 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased original equipment orders across all divisions, primarily driven by lower beginning backlog in the oil and gas and general industries for 2010, as compared with 2009, reflecting lower demand and customer-driven project delays due to a significant decrease in the rate of general global economic growth in 2009. These decreases were slightly offset by increased aftermarket sales in EPD, driven by Latin America and Asia Pacific, and in FCD by sales provided by Valbart of $38.3 million. Sales to international customers, including export sales from the U.S., were approximately 73% of sales in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 . Sales to EMA were approximately 39% , 40% and 40% of total sales in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Sales to Asia Pacific were approximately 19% , 18% and 20% of total sales in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Sales to Latin America were approximately 10% , 10% and 9% of total sales in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Gross profit $ 1,513.6 $ 1,409.7 $ 1,548.1 Gross profit margin 33.6 % 35.0 % 35.5 % Gross profit in 2011 increased by $103.9 million, or 7.4% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included the effect of approximately $13 million in increased savings realized and $9.9 million of decreased charges resulting from our Realignment Programs, partially offset by $6.8 million in charges related to the IPD recovery plan, as compared with 2010. Gross profit margin in 2011 of 33.6% decreased from 35.0% in 2010 . The decrease was primarily attributable to lower margins on certain large projects primarily in beginning of year backlog, the negative impact of currency on margins of U.S. dollar-denominated sales produced in some of our non-U.S. facilities, incremental charges associated with certain projects that have not shipped or shipped late in EPD, charges related to the IPD recovery plan and increased material costs in FCD. The decrease was partially offset by a mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales in all divisions. As a result of the sales mix shift, aftermarket sales increased to approximately 41% of total sales, as compared with approximately 39% of total sales for the same period in 2010. Gross profit in 2010 decreased by $138.4 million, or 8.9%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included the effect of approximately $37 million in increased savings realized and a decrease of $27.0 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 of 35.0% decreased from 35.5% in 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to less favorable pricing from beginning of year backlog in EPD and IPD as compared with 2009 and the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, the effects of which were partially offset by a sales mix shift toward higher margin aftermarket sales in EPD and IPD, increased utilization of low-cost regions by FCD, positive impacts of our Realignment Programs and various CIP initiatives. Aftermarket sales increased to approximately 39% of total sales in 2010, as compared with approximately 36% of total sales in 2009. 30 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expense 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) SG&A $ 914.1 $ 845.0 $ 934.5 SG&A as a percentage of sales 20.3 % 21.0 % 21.4 % SG&A in 2011 increased by $69.1 million, or 8.2% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency effects that yielded an increase of approximately $25 million, and also included the effect of approximately $10 million in increased savings realized and $3.6 million of decreased charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental selling and marketing-related expenses associated with the above mentioned increase in sales, merit-related compensation increases, acquisition-related costs and other incremental SG&A costs associated with the acquisition of LPI during the fourth quarter of 2011 and the impact of hiring associates to support high-growth areas of the business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in broad-based annual and long-term incentive program compensation. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2011 improved 70 basis points as compared with 2010 . SG&A in 2010 decreased by $89.5 million, or 9.6%, as compared with 2009. Currency effects yielded a decrease of approximately $2 million. The decrease included the effect of approximately $23 million in increased savings realized and a decrease of $22.8 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to positive impacts from our Realignment Programs, decreased selling and marketing-related expenses, strict cost control actions in 2010 and legal fees and accrued resolution costs in 2009 related to shareholder class action litigation (which was resolved in the second quarter of 2010) that did not recur, partially offset by cash recoveries of bad debt and the adjustment of contingent consideration in 2009 that did not recur (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report). SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2010 improved 40 basis points as compared with 2009. Net Earnings from Affiliates 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions) Net earnings from affiliates $ 19.1 $ 16.6 $ 15.8 Net earnings from affiliates represents our net income from investments in eight joint ventures ( one located in each of Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and two located in each of China and India) that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Net earnings from affiliates in 2011 increased by $2.5 million, or 15.1% , as compared with 2010 , primarily due to increased earnings of our FCD joint venture in India. Net earnings from affiliates in 2010 increased by $0.8 million, or 5.1%, as compared with 2009, primarily due to increased earnings of our EPD joint ventures in South Korea and India, partially offset by decreased earnings of our FCD joint venture in India and our EPD joint venture in Japan. Operating Income 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Operating income $ 618.7 $ 581.4 $ 629.5 Operating income as a percentage of sales 13.7 % 14.4 % 14.4 % Operating income in 2011 increased by $37.3 million, or 6.4% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $17 million. The increase included the effect of approximately $24 million in increased savings realized from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2010. The overall net increase was primarily a result of the $103.9 million increase in gross profit, which was partially offset by the $69.1 million increase in SG&A, as discussed above. Operating income in 2010 decreased by $48.1 million, or 7.6%, as compared with 2009. Operating income included the effect of approximately $60 million in increased savings realized and a decrease of $49.8 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, and included negative currency effects of approximately $4 million. The overall net decrease was primarily a result of the $138.4 million decrease in gross profit, which was partially offset by the $89.5 million decrease in SG&A, as discussed above. 31 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Interest Income 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions) Interest expense $ (36.2 ) $ (34.3 ) $ (40.0 ) Interest income 1.6 1.6 3.2 Interest expense in 2011 increased by $1.9 million as compared with 2010 primarily due to increased interest expense on local borrowings to fund short-term cash needs in support of growth in emerging markets and the impact of the refinancing of our credit facilities in late 2010. Interest expense decreased by $5.7 million in 2010 as compared with 2009, as a result of decreased interest rates. At December 31, 2011 , approximately 70% of our debt was at fixed rates, including the effects of $330.0 million of notional interest rate swaps. Interest income in 2011 was consistent with 2010 . Interest income in 2010 decreased by $1.6 million as compared with 2009 due primarily to decreased interest rates. Other Income (Expense), net 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions) Other income (expense), net $ 3.7 $ (18.3 ) $ (8.0 ) Other income (expense), net in 2011 increased $22.0 million to income of $3.7 million, as compared to expense of $18.3 million in 2010 , primarily due to a $23.9 million increase in gains arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites' functional currencies, which reflect the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro during 2011 as compared with 2010. Currency losses in 2010 included the impact of the $7.6 million net loss recorded as a result of Venezuela's currency devaluation and the settlement of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities at the more favorable essential items rate of 2.60 Bolivars to the U.S. dollar. These losses were partially offset by a $3.1 million gain on the sale of an investment in a joint venture in 2010 that was accounted for under the cost method. Other income (expense), net in 2010 increased $10.3 million, or 128.8%, to expense of $18.3 million, as compared with 2009, primarily due to a $13.9 million increase in losses on forward exchange contracts and a $4.8 million increase in losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites functional currencies. Both of the above-mentioned changes primarily reflected the strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro. Also included in the increase in losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our site functional currencies is the impact of the $7.6 million net loss recorded as a result of Venezuela devaluation of the Bolivar and the settlement of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities at the more favorable essential items rate. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation. In addition, we expensed $1.6 million in loan costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facilities in the fourth quarter of 2010. The above losses were partially offset by miscellaneous gains and income, the largest of which was a $3.1 million gain on the sale of an investment in a joint venture in 2010 that was accounted for under the cost method. Tax Expense and Tax Rate 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 158.5 $ 141.6 $ 156.5 Effective tax rate 27.0 % 26.7 % 26.8 % The 2011, 2010 and 2009 effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which included the impacts of lower foreign tax rates, and changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions. On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was signed into law, creating an exclusion from U.S. taxable income for certain types of foreign related party payments of dividends, interest, rents and royalties that, prior to 2006, had been subject to U.S. taxation. This exclusion is effective for the years 2006 through 2011, and applies to certain of our related party payments. Our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location. Changes in any of these and other factors, including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating 32 Table of Contents losses or results from tax audits, could impact the tax rate in future periods. As of December 31, 2011, we have foreign tax credits of $43.4 million, expiring in 2018 through 2020 against which we recorded no valuation allowances. Additionally, we have recorded other net deferred tax assets of $38.6 million, which relate to net operating losses, tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods, most of which do not have a definite expiration. Should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses, our effective tax rate would increase. Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation $ 428.6 $ 388.3 $ 427.9 Net earnings per share diluted $ 7.64 $ 6.88 $ 7.59 Average diluted shares 56.1 56.4 56.4 Net earnings in 2011 increased by $40.3 million to $428.6 million, or to $7.64 per diluted share, as compared with 2010 . The increase was primarily attributable to $37.3 million increase in operating income and a $22.0 million increase in other income (expense), net, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in interest expense and a $16.9 million increase in tax expense. Net earnings in 2010 decreased by $39.6 million to $388.3 million, or to $6.88 per diluted share, as compared with 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to $48.1 million decrease in operating income and a $10.3 million increase in other income (expense), net, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in interest expense and a $14.9 million decrease in tax expense. Other Comprehensive (Expense) Income 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions) Other comprehensive (expense) income $ (65.6 ) $ (1.4 ) $ 63.0 Other comprehensive (expense) income in 2011 increased by $64.2 million, primarily reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro at December 31, 2011 as compared with December 31, 2010 . Other comprehensive (expense) income in 2010 decreased by $64.4 million to expense of $1.4 million, primarily reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro at December 31, 2010 as compared with December 31, 2009, partially offset by a decrease in pension and other postretirement expense in 2010. Business Segments We conduct our operations through three business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment operating income. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our segments. The key operating results for our three business segments, EPD, IPD and FCD, are discussed below. FSG Engineered Product Division Segment Results Our largest business segment is EPD, through which we design, manufacture, distribute and service custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts (collectively referred to as "original equipment"). EPD includes longer lead-time, highly-engineered pump products, and shorter cycle engineered pumps and mechanical seals that are generally manufactured much more quickly. EPD also manufactures replacement parts and related equipment and provides a full array of replacement parts, repair and support services (collectively referred to as "aftermarket"). EPD primarily operates in the oil and gas, power generation, chemical, water management and general industries. EPD operates in 41 countries with 28 manufacturing facilities worldwide, nine of which are located in Europe, 11 in North America, four in Asia and four in Latin America, and it has 120 QRCs, including those co-located in manufacturing facilities. 33 Table of Contents EPD 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Bookings $ 2,333.5 $ 2,242.0 $ 1,976.0 Sales 2,321.4 2,152.7 2,316.3 Gross profit 803.4 782.9 843.5 Gross profit margin 34.6 % 36.4 % 36.4 % Segment operating income 395.2 412.6 434.8 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 17.0 % 19.2 % 18.8 % Backlog (at period end) 1,441.6 1,435.5 1,382.1 As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we acquired for inclusion in EPD, LPI, a privately-owned, U.S.-based pump manufacturer, effective October 28, 2011. LPI's results of operations have been consolidated since the date of acquisition and are included in EPD's segment results of operations above. No pro forma information has been provided for the acquisition due to immateriality. Bookings in 2011 increased by $91.5 million, or 4.1% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $65 million. The increase in bookings reflected the impact of an order in excess of $80 million to supply a variety of pumps for a refinery, received primarily in the first quarter of 2011, as well as the impact of an order in excess of $80 million for crude oil pumps, seals and related support services booked in 2010 that did not recur. Customer bookings increased $59.9 million in Latin America, $46.8 million (including currency benefits of approximately $19 million) in Asia Pacific, and $31.7 million in North America. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $42.2 million in EMA (including currency benefits of approximately $41 million). The overall net increase primarily consisted of an increase in the power generation and chemical industries. Of the $2.3 billion of bookings in 2011 , approximately 50% were from oil and gas, 21% from power generation, 13% from chemical, 1% from water management and 15% from general industries. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) increased $3.3 million. Bookings in 2010 increased by $266.0 million, or 13.5%, as compared with 2009. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $13 million. The increase in bookings reflected higher demand for our products in the oil and gas and general industries across all regions, including the impact of an order in excess of $80 million for crude oil pumps, seals and related support services received in the second quarter of 2010. Customer bookings increased $114.9 million (including currency benefits of approximately $13 million) in Latin America, $78.2 million in North America (including currency benefits of approximately $8 million), $63.4 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $26 million) in EMA and $23.8 million (including currency benefits of approximately $18 million) in Asia Pacific. These increases were attributable to original equipment and aftermarket bookings on major projects in the oil and gas, general, mining, power generation and chemical industries, partially offset by decreased bookings in the water management industry and decreased aftermarket bookings in EMA. Of the $2.2 billion of bookings in 2010, approximately 54% were from oil and gas, 19% from power generation, 12% from chemical, 1% from water management and 14% from general industries. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) increased $12.4 million. Sales in 2011 increased $168.7 million, or 7.8% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $67 million. Customer sales increased in North America by $75.7 million, Latin America by $61.3 million and Asia Pacific by $58.7 million (including currency benefits of approximately $18 million). These increases were primarily driven by increased aftermarket sales in North America and Latin America, and original equipment sales in Asia Pacific. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in customer sales in EMA of $33.0 million (including currency benefits of approximately $41 million), primarily driven by decreased original equipment sales. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) increased $16.3 million. Sales in 2010 decreased $163.6 million, or 7.1%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $4 million. Customer sales decreased in EMA by $131.3 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $43 million) and North America by $79.8 million (including currency benefits of approximately $8 million), primarily driven by original equipment sales. These decreases were partially offset by increases of customer sales in Latin America of $32.5 million (including currency benefits of $14 million) and Asia Pacific of $10.2 million (including currency benefits of approximately $17 million), primarily driven by increased aftermarket sales. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $1.4 million. Gross profit in 2011 increased by $20.5 million, or 2.6% , as compared with 2010 . Gross profit margin in 2011 of 34.6% decreased from 36.4% in 2010 . The decrease was primarily attributable to the effect on revenue of certain large projects at low 34 Table of Contents margins primarily in beginning of year backlog, the negative impact of currency on margins of U.S. dollar denominated sales produced in some of our non-U.S. facilities and incremental charges associated with certain projects that have not shipped or shipped late, partially offset by a sales mix shift towards higher margin aftermarket sales. Gross profit in 2010 decreased by $60.6 million, or 7.2%, as compared with 2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 of 36.4% was comparable with the same period in 2009. Gross profit margin was negatively impacted by less favorable pricing from beginning of year backlog as compared with 2009 and the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. The decrease in gross profit margin was mostly offset by a sales mix shift towards higher margin aftermarket sales, increased savings realized and decreased charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, as well as operational efficiencies and savings realized from our supply chain initiatives. Operating income in 2011 decreased by $17.4 million, or 4.2% , as compared with 2010 . The decrease included currency benefits of approximately $9 million. The overall net decrease was due primarily to increased SG&A of $37.9 million (including increases due to currency effects of approximately $12 million), partially offset by increased gross profit of $20.5 million, as discussed above. Increased SG&A was attributable to incremental selling and marketing-related expenses associated with the above mentioned increase in sales, merit-related compensation increases, the impact of hiring associates to support high-growth areas of the business, acquisition-related and other incremental SG&A costs associated with the acquisition of LPI in the fourth quarter of 2011 and a $3.9 million penalty that was assessed by a Spanish regulatory commission in the second quarter of 2011. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in broad-based annual and long-term incentive program compensation. Operating income in 2010 decreased by $22.2 million, or 5.1%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of less than $1 million. The overall net decrease was due primarily to reduced gross profit of $60.6 million, as discussed above, partially offset by decreased SG&A of $36.0 million, which was due to increased savings realized and a decrease in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, decreased selling and marketing-related expenses and strict cost control actions in 2010. Additionally, the $4.4 million benefit from the adjustment of contingent consideration in 2009 related to the acquisition of Calder did not recur (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report). Backlog of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2011 increased by $6.1 million, or 0.4% , as compared to December 31, 2010 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $14 million. Backlog of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2011 included $19.9 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010 increased by $53.4 million, or 3.9%, as compared to December 31, 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $14 million. Backlog at December 31, 2010 includes $25.5 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). FSG Industrial Product Division Segment Results Through IPD we design, manufacture, distribute and service engineered, pre-configured industrial pumps and pump systems, including submersible motors and specialty products (e.g., thrusters), collectively referred to as "original equipment." Additionally, IPD manufactures replacement parts and related equipment, and provides a full array of support services (collectively referred to as "aftermarket"). IPD primarily operates in the oil and gas, chemical, water management, power generation and general industries. IPD operates 12 manufacturing facilities, three of which are located in the U.S and six in Europe, and it operates 21 QRCs worldwide, including 11 sites in Europe and four in the U.S., including those co-located in manufacturing facilities. IPD 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Bookings $ 905.4 $ 827.5 $ 823.1 Sales 878.2 800.2 971.0 Gross profit 197.5 204.7 262.5 Gross profit margin 22.5 % 25.6 % 27.0 % Segment operating income 62.9 68.5 107.9 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 7.2 % 8.6 % 11.1 % Backlog (at period end) 567.8 568.0 555.6 Bookings in 2011 increased by $77.9 million, or 9.4% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $29 million. The increase was primarily driven by increased customer bookings of $45.4 million (including currency benefits of approximately $20 million) in EMA and Australia. Increased customer bookings were driven by general and chemical industries, partially offset by decreased customer bookings in the water management industry. Interdivision bookings (which are 35 Table of Contents eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) increased $32.2 million. Of the $905.4 million of bookings in 2011 , approximately 29% were from oil and gas, 19% from water management, 11% from chemical, 8% from power generation and 33% from general industries. Bookings in 2010 increased by $4.4 million, or 0.5%, as compared with 2009. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $11 million. The overall net increase was primarily driven by an increase in customer bookings of $57.1 million in the Americas and an increase in interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) of $20.2 million, mostly offset by decreased customer bookings of $74.3 million in EMA and Australia. The overall net decrease in customer bookings was primarily driven by decreased orders of original equipment in the power generation, mining and chemical industries, partially offset by increased customer bookings in the oil and gas markets, primarily in Europe. Of the $827.5 million of bookings in 2010, approximately 31% were from oil and gas, 21% from water management, 10% from chemical, 9% from power generation and 29% from general industries. Sales in 2011 increased by $78.0 million, or 9.7% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $29 million. The increase in customer sales was driven by an increase of $64.2 million in the Americas, partially offset by a decrease of $16.1 million (including currency benefits of approximately $21 million ) in EMA and Australia. The increase in the Americas was primarily driven by original equipment sales. The decline in EMA and Australia was primarily attributable to decreased original equipment sales, which resulted from lower beginning of year original equipment backlog as compared with 2010. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) increased $30.0 million. Sales in 2010 decreased by $170.8 million, or 17.6%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $9 million. The decreases in customer sales was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of $133.0 million in EMA and Australia and $30.5 million in the Americas. The declines, primarily in the power generation, mining and chemical industries, were attributable to lower backlog as compared with 2009 and included the impact of thruster sales for orders booked in 2008 that did not recur in 2010. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $6.3 million. Gross profit in 2011 decreased by $7.2 million, or 3.5% , as compared with 2010 . Gross profit margin in 2011 of 22.5% decreased from 25.6% in 2010 . The decrease is primarily attributable to less favorable pricing on projects shipped from backlog, increased material costs, charges related to the IPD recovery plan and incremental charges resulting from operational efficiency issues in certain sites, partially offset by increased savings realized from our Realignment Programs, as compared with the same period in 2010, and a mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales. Gross profit in 2010 decreased by $57.8 million, or 22.0%, as compared with 2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 of 25.6% decreased from 27.0% in 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and less favorable pricing from backlog as compared with 2009, partially offset by a sales mix shift toward more profitable aftermarket sales and increased savings realized and lower charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with the same period in 2009. Operating income for 2011 decreased by $5.6 million, or 8.2% , as compared with 2010 . The decrease included currency benefits of approximately $2 million. The overall net decrease is due to the $7.2 million decrease in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in SG&A. Operating income for 2010 decreased by $39.4 million, or 36.5%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $3 million. The decrease is due to the $57.8 million decrease in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by an $18.4 million decrease in SG&A. The decrease in SG&A is due to decreased selling-related expenses, strict cost control actions in 2010 and increased savings realized and lower charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009. Backlog of $567.8 million at December 31, 2011 remained flat, as compared to December 31, 2010 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $13 million. Backlog at December 31, 2011 included $56.7 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $568.0 million at December 31, 2010 increased by $12.4 million, or 2.2%, as compared to December 31, 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $24 million. Backlog at December 31, 2010 included $38.5 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Flow Control Division Segment Results Our second largest business segment is FCD, which designs, manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of engineered-to-order and configured-to-order isolation valves, control valves, valve automation products, boiler controls and related services. FCD leverages its experience and application know-how by offering a complete menu of engineered services to complement its 36 Table of Contents expansive product portfolio. FCD has a total of 55 manufacturing facilities and QRCs in 23 countries around the world, with five of its 25 manufacturing operations located in the U.S. and 14 located in Europe. Based on independent industry sources, we believe that we are the fourth largest industrial valve supplier on a global basis. FCD 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Bookings $ 1,603.0 $ 1,306.6 $ 1,198.3 Sales 1,473.3 1,197.5 1,203.2 Gross profit 511.5 422.3 445.2 Gross profit margin 34.7 % 35.3 % 37.0 % Segment operating income 233.3 180.4 204.1 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 15.8 % 15.1 % 17.0 % Backlog (at period end) 759.9 658.5 485.3 As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we acquired for inclusion in FCD, Valbart, a privately-owned Italian valve manufacturer, effective July 16, 2010. Valbart results of operations have been consolidated since the date of acquisition and are included in FCD segment results of operations above. No pro forma information has been provided for the acquisition due to immateriality. Bookings in 2011 increased $296.4 million, or 22.7% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $54 million and increased Valbart bookings of $110.4 million. The increase in bookings was primarily attributable to strength in the oil and gas industry, primarily in EMA and Asia Pacific, and increased bookings in the chemical and general industries. Increased bookings were partially offset by decreases in the power generation industry due primarily to a slowdown in global nuclear power projects. Of the $1.6 billion of bookings in 2011 , approximately 31% were from oil and gas, 27% from chemical, 27% from general industries 14% from power generation and 1% from water management. Bookings in 2010 increased $108.3 million, or 9.0%, as compared with 2009. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $14 million. The overall net increase in bookings was attributable to bookings provided by Valbart of $54.6 million, strength in the oil and gas industry, primarily in EMA and North America, increased bookings in general industries, driven by growth in the district heating market in Russia, and growing aftermarket repair and replacement orders. Inventory restocking orders from distributors were a key driver in the North American market recovery. Increased bookings were partially offset by decreases in the power generation industry, driven by orders of more than $45 million to supply valves to four Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear power units booked in the same period in 2009 that did not recur, and customer-driven large project delays in the chemical and oil and gas industries. Of the $1.3 billion of bookings in 2010, approximately 27% were from oil and gas, 27% from chemical, 26% from general industries 18% from power generation and 2% from water management. Sales in 2011 increased $275.8 million, or 23.0% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $48 million. Customer sales increased by approximately $172 million (including currency benefits of approximately $39 million) in EMA, reflecting continued recovery in the oil and gas industry and included increased Valbart sales of $74.6 million. Customer sales increased by approximately $50 million in Asia Pacific, $47 million in North America and $10 million in Latin America. Sales in 2010 decreased $5.7 million, or 0.5%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $19 million. A decrease in customer sales in EMA of approximately $27 million, which included the impact of customer sales provided by Valbart of $38.3 million, was primarily driven by a decline in customer sales in the chemical industry, as well as customer-driven delays in large projects in the oil and gas industry. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in customer sales of approximately $17 million in Asia Pacific, primarily driven by the nuclear and fossil power markets in China. Gross profit in 2011 increased by $89.2 million, or 21.1% as compared with 2010 . Gross profit margin in 2011 of 34.7% decreased from 35.3% for the same period in 2010 . The decrease was attributable to increased material costs, partially offset by increased sales, which favorably impacted our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, and various CIP initiatives. Gross profit in 2010 decreased by $22.9 million, or 5.1% as compared with 2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 of 35.3% decreased from 37.0% for the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to the negative impact of low margins on acquired Valbart backlog, as well as decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix and increased savings realized and decreased charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, as well as various CIP initiatives and improved utilization of low-cost regions. Operating income in 2011 increased by $52.9 million, or 29.3% , as compared with 2010 . The increase included currency 37 Table of Contents benefits of approximately $7 million. The increase was principally attributable to the $89.2 million increase in gross profit discussed above. The increase was partially offset by a $38.8 million increase in SG&A, which was attributable to incremental selling and marketing-related expenses associated with the above mentioned increase in sales, merit-related compensation increases, increased research and development costs and the impact of hiring associates to support high-growth areas of the business. Operating income in 2010 decreased by $23.7 million, or 11.6%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $1 million. The decrease was principally attributable to the $22.9 million decrease in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in SG&A. Decreased SG&A was attributable to decreased selling and marketing-related expenses and increased savings realized and decreased charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, partially offset by $5.0 million in bad debt recoveries from the same period in 2009 that did not recur and $2.7 million in Valbart acquisition-related costs. Valbart provided a net operating loss of $12.4 million, including the impact of acquisition-related costs. Backlog of $759.9 million at December 31, 2011 increased by $101.4 million, or 15.4% , as compared to December 31, 2010 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $24 million. Backlog of $658.5 million at December 31, 2010 increased by $173.2 million, or 35.7% as compared to December 31, 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $13 million. The overall net increase included backlog related to the acquisition of Valbart of $94.8 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Analysis 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 218.2 $ 355.8 $ 431.3 Net cash flows used by investing activities (194.2 ) (286.7 ) (138.6 ) Net cash flows used by financing activities (239.0 ) (142.9 ) (107.1 ) Existing cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving line of credit are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2011 was $337.4 million, compared with $557.6 million at December 31, 2010 and $654.3 million at December 31, 2009 . Our lower cash provided by operating activities reflected additional cash used to support short-term working capital needs and the impact of a trend towards contractually longer payment terms in 2011 as compared with 2010 . Working capital increased in 2011 due primarily to higher accounts receivable of $243.1 million and higher inventory of $139.8 million . During 2011 , we contributed $8.9 million to our U.S. pension plan. Working capital increased in 2010 due primarily to lower accrued liabilities of $125.6 million resulting primarily from reductions in accruals for long-term and broad-based annual incentive program payments, higher inventory of $52.9 million and higher accounts receivable of $52.0 million, partially offset by higher accounts payable of $70.7 million. During 2010, we contributed $33.4 million to our U.S. pension plan. Increases in accounts receivable used $243.1 million of cash flow for 2011 , as compared with $52.0 million in 2010 and providing cash of $50.7 million in 2009 . The increase was primarily attributable to delays in the collection of accounts receivable due to slower than anticipated payments from certain customers, relatively strong sales in December 2011, in part due to the completion of certain previously past due projects, and contractually longer payment terms in 2011 as compared to 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2011 , our DSO was 75 days as compared with 66 days and 59 days for the same periods in 2010 and 2009 , respectively. For reference purposes based on 2011 sales, a DSO improvement of one day could provide approximately $14 million in cash. We have not experienced a significant increase in customer payment defaults. An increase in inventory used $139.8 million of cash flow for 2011 compared with $52.9 million in 2010 and providing cash of $74.7 million in 2009 . The increase was primarily due to shipment delays and growth of short cycle orders during 2011, requiring higher raw material and work in process inventory to support end of period backlog. Inventory turns were 3.4 times at December 31, 2011 , compared with 3.4 times at December 31, 2010 and 4.0 times at December 31, 2009 . Our calculation of inventory turns does not reflect the impact of advanced cash received from our customers. For reference purposes based on 2011 data, an improvement of one-tenth of a turn could yield approximately $23 million in cash. We continue to work through isolated execution issues, which have contributed to the delays mentioned above, and work with our customers to finalize collection of accounts receivable. At the end of 2011, we began to see past due projects trend downward due to our efforts to target such projects, and we remain highly focused on further reducing past due projects. Cash outflows for investing activities were $194.2 million, $286.7 million and $138.6 million in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively, due primarily to capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. Cash outflows for 2011 included $89.6 million for the acquisition of LPI, as discussed below in "Payments for Acquisitions." Capital expenditures during 2011 were 38 Table of Contents $108.0 million, an increase of $6.0 million as compared with 2010 . In 2011, our capital expenditures have been focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic expansion, enterprise resource planning application upgrades, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities. Cash outflows for financing activities were $239.0 million in 2011 compared with $142.9 million in 2010 and $107.1 million in 2009 . Cash outflows during 2011 resulted primarily from the repurchase of $150.0 million of our common stock, payment of $69.6 million in dividends and $25.0 million of payments on long-term debt. Cash outflows during 2010 resulted primarily from the payment of $63.6 million in dividends, $46.0 million for the repurchase of our common stock and approximately $40 million to liquidate debt in completing a new credit agreement in December 2010. On February 21, 2011 , our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock from $0.29 per share to $0.32 per share payable quarterly beginning on April 14, 2011. On February 20, 2012 , our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock from $0.32 per share to $0.36 per share payable quarterly beginning on April 13, 2012 . Generally, our dividend date-of-record is in the last month of the quarter, and the dividend is paid the following month. On February 27, 2008, our Board of Directors announced the approval of a program to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2011. On September 12, 2011, our Board of Directors announced the approval of a new program to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock over an unspecified time period. We repurchased $7.3 million and $101.6 million of our common stock under the old and new programs, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2011. On December 15, 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors approved the replenishment of the new $300.0 million share repurchase program, providing the full $300.0 million in remaining authorized repurchase capacity at December 31, 2011. Our share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and we reserve the right to limit or terminate the repurchase program at any time without notice. We repurchased 1,482,833 , 450,000 and 544,500 shares for $150.0 million, $46.0 million and $40.9 million during 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. To date, we have repurchased a total of 4,218,433 shares for $401.9 million under these programs. On December 15, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors endorsed a policy of annually returning to our shareholders 40% to 50% of our running two-year average net earnings in the form of quarterly dividends or stock repurchases. While we intend to adhere to this policy for the foreseeable future, any future returns of cash, whether through any combination of dividends or share repurchases, will be reviewed individually, declared by our Board of Directors and implemented by management at its discretion, depending on our financial condition, business opportunities at the time and market conditions. Our cash needs for the next 12 months are expected to be consistent with 2011, resulting from the impact of anticipated share repurchases, an expected improvement in working capital utilization and a small decrease in incentive compensation payments, offset by anticipated increases in pension contributions, capital expenditures and cash dividends. We believe cash flows from operating activities, combined with availability under our revolving line of credit and our existing cash balances, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by a decrease in the rate of general global economic growth, as well as economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for periods beyond the next 12 months. Payments for Acquisitions We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise economical capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, effective October 28, 2011 , we acquired for inclusion in EPD, 100% of LPI, a privately-owned, U.S.-based pump manufacturer, in a share purchase for cash of $89.6 million , subject to final adjustments. LPI specializes in the design, development and manufacture of engineered centrifugal slurry pumps for critical services within the petroleum refining, petrochemical, pulp and paper and energy markets. Effective July 16, 2010, we acquired for inclusion in FCD, 100% of Valbart, a privately-owned Italian valve manufacturer, in a share purchase for cash of $199.4 million, which included $33.8 million of existing Valbart net debt (defined as Valbart third party debt less cash on hand) that was repaid at closing. 39 Table of Contents Valbart manufactures trunnion-mounted ball valves used primarily in upstream and midstream oil and gas applications, which enables us to offer a more complete valve product portfolio to our oil and gas project customers. Effective April 21, 2009, we acquired for inclusion in EPD, Calder, a private Swiss company and a supplier of energy recovery technology for use in the global desalination market, for $30.8 million, net of cash acquired. Financing Debt, including capital lease obligations, consisted of: December 31, 2011 2010 (Amounts in thousands) Term Loan, interest rate of 2.58% and 2.30% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively $ 475,000 $ 500,000 Capital lease obligations and other borrowings 30,216 27,711 Debt and capital lease obligations 505,216 527,711 Less amounts due within one year 53,623 51,481 Total debt due after one year $ 451,593 $ 476,230 Credit Facilities On December 14, 2010 we entered into a credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as swingline lender, letter of credit issuer and administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (together, the "Lenders"). The Credit Agreement provides for a $500.0 million term loan facility with a maturity date of December 14, 2015 and a $500.0 million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of December 14, 2015 (collectively referred to as "Credit Facilities"). The revolving credit facility includes a $300.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $200.0 million . At December 31, 2011 , we had $9.8 million in deferred loan costs included in other assets, net. These costs are being amortized over the term of the Credit Agreement and are recorded in interest expense. At December 31, 2011 and 2010 , we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, respectively. We had outstanding letters of credit of $147.4 million and $133.9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively, which reduced our borrowing capacity to $352.6 million and $366.1 million , respectively. Borrowings under our Credit Facilities, other than in respect of swingline loans, bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.75% to 2.50% , as applicable, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio, or, (2) the base rate which is based on the greater of the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under our Credit Facilities or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% , or (3) a daily rate equal to the one month LIBOR plus 1.0% plus, as applicable, a margin of 0.75% to 1.50% determined by reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). The applicable interest rate as of December 31, 2011 was 2.58% for borrowings under our Credit Facilities. In connection with our Credit Facilities, we have entered into $330.0 million of notional amount of interest rate swaps at December 31, 2011 to hedge exposure to floating interest rates. We pay the Lenders under the Credit Facilities a commitment fee equal to a percentage ranging from 0.30% to 0.50% , determined by reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of the unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility, and letter of credit fees with respect to each standby letter of credit outstanding under our Credit Facilities equal to a percentage based on the applicable margin in effect for LIBOR borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The fees for financial and performance standby letters of credit are 2.0% and 1.0% , respectively. Our obligations under the Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by substantially all of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain controlled company and materiality exceptions. The Lenders have agreed to release the collateral if we achieve an Investment Grade Rating by both Moody Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Ratings Services for our senior unsecured, non-credit-enhanced, long-term debt (in each case, with an outlook of stable or better), with the understanding that identical collateral will be required to be pledged to the Lenders anytime following a release of the collateral that the Investment Grade Rating is not maintained. In addition, prior to our obtaining and maintaining investment grade credit ratings, our and the guarantors obligations under the Credit Facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our and the guarantors assets. We have not achieved these ratings as of December 31, 2011 . 40 Table of Contents European Letter of Credit Facilities On October 30, 2009 , we entered into a new 364-day unsecured European Letter of Credit Facility ( New European LOC Facility ) with an initial commitment of 125.0 million . The New European LOC Facility is renewable annually and, consistent with our previous European Letter of Credit Facility ("Old European LOC Facility"), is used for contingent obligations in respect of surety and performance bonds, bank guarantees and similar obligations with maturities up to five years. We renewed the New European LOC Facility in October 2011 consistent with its terms for an additional 364-day period. We pay fees between 1.10% and 1.35% for utilized capacity and 0.40% for unutilized capacity under our New European LOC Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit drawn on the New European LOC Facility of 81.0 million ( $105.0 million ) and 55.7 million ( $74.5 million ) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Our ability to issue additional letters of credit under our Old European LOC Facility, which had a commitment of 110.0 million , expired November 9, 2009 . We paid annual and fronting fees of 0.875% and 0.10% , respectively, for letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility of 12.2 million ( $15.8 million ) and 33.3 million ( $44.5 million ) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Certain banks are parties to both facilities and are managing their exposures on an aggregated basis. As such, the commitment under the New European LOC Facility is reduced by the face amount of existing letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility prior to its expiration. These existing letters of credit will remain outstanding, and accordingly offset the 125.0 million capacity of the New European LOC Facility until their maturity, which, as of December 31, 2011 , was approximately one year for the majority of the outstanding existing letters of credit. After consideration of outstanding commitments under both facilities, the available capacity under the New European LOC Facility was 116.7 million as of December 31, 2011 , of which 81.0 million has been utilized. Debt Prepayments and Repayments We made total scheduled repayments under our current Credit Agreement and previous credit agreement of $25.0 million , $4.3 million , and $5.7 million in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. We made no mandatory repayments or optional prepayments in 2011 , 2010 or 2009 , with the exception of the proceeds advanced under the term loan facility of our Credit Agreement, along with approximately $40 million of cash on hand that were used to repay all previously outstanding indebtedness under our previous credit agreement, which included a $600.0 million term loan and $400.0 million revolving line of credit. We may prepay loans under our Credit Facilities in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time. Debt Covenants and Other Matters Our Credit Agreement contains, among other things, covenants defining our and our subsidiaries ability to dispose of assets, merge, pay dividends, repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness, incur indebtedness and guarantees, create liens, enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses, make certain investments or acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates or engage in any business activity other than our existing business. Our Credit Agreement also contains covenants requiring us to deliver to lenders our leverage and interest coverage financial covenant certificates of compliance. The maximum permitted leverage ratio is 3.25 times debt to total consolidated EBITDA. The minimum interest coverage is 3.25 times consolidated EBITDA to total interest expense. Compliance with these financial covenants under our Credit Agreement is tested quarterly. We complied with the covenants through December 31, 2011 . Our Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal or interest, violation of covenants, incorrectness of representations and warranties, cross defaults and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material judgments, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), events, actual or asserted invalidity of the guarantees or the security documents, and certain changes of control of our company. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the acceleration of our and the guarantors obligations under the Credit Facilities. Our European letter of credit facilities contain covenants restricting the ability of certain foreign subsidiaries to issue debt, incur liens, sell assets, merge, consolidate, make certain investments, pay dividends, enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses or engage in any business activity other than our existing business. The European letter of credit facilities also incorporate by reference the covenants contained in our Credit Facilities. Our European letter of credit facilities include events of default usual for these types of letter of credit facilities, including nonpayment of any fee or obligation, violation of covenants, incorrectness of representations and warranties, cross defaults and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material judgments, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of the guarantees and certain changes of control of our company. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the termination of the commitments and an acceleration of our obligations under the European letter of credit facilities. We complied with all covenants under our European letter of credit facilities through December 31, 2011. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity Analysis Our cash balance decreased by $220.2 million to $337.4 million as of December 31, 2011 as compared with December 31, 2010 . The cash usage included the funding of increased working capital requirements, reductions in advanced cash received from customers, $150.0 million of share repurchases, $108.0 million in capital expenditures, the acquisition of LPI for $89.6 million and $69.6 million in dividend payments. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Approximately 5% of our term loan is due to mature in 2012 and approximately 11% in 2013 . As noted above, our term loan and our revolving line of credit both mature in December 2015. After the effects of $330.0 million of notional interest rate swaps, approximately 70% of our term debt was at fixed rates at December 31, 2011 . As of December 31, 2011 , we had a borrowing capacity of $352.6 million on our $500.0 million revolving line of credit (due to outstanding letters of credit), and we had net available capacity under the New European LOC Facility of 35.7 million. Our Credit Facilities and our New European LOC Facility are committed and are held by a diversified group of financial institutions. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, as a result of increases in values of the plan assets and our contributions to the plan, our U.S. pension plan was fully funded as defined by applicable law. After consideration of our intent to maintain fully funded status, we contributed $8.9 million to our U.S. pension plan in 2011, excluding direct benefits paid. We continue to maintain an asset allocation consistent with our strategy to maximize total return, while reducing portfolio risks through asset class diversification. At December 31, 2011, $188.4 million of our total cash balance of $337.4 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, $149.9 million of which we consider permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Based on the expected 2012 liquidity needs of our various geographies, we currently do not anticipate the need to repatriate any permanently reinvested cash to fund domestic operations that would generate adverse tax results. However, in the event this cash is needed to fund domestic operations, we estimate the $149.9 million could be repatriated without resulting in a material U.S. tax liability. At December 31, 2011, we had no direct investments in European sovereign or non-sovereign debt. However, certain of our defined benefit plans hold investments in European equity and fixed income securities as discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Other than broad, macro-level economic impacts, we did not experience any direct or measurable disruptions in 2011 due to the European sovereign debt crisis. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of any future developments in the region on our current business, our customers and suppliers and the state of the global economy. Additional adverse developments could potentially impact our customers exposures to sovereign and non-sovereign European debt and could soften the level of capital investment and demand for our products and services. OUTLOOK FOR 2012 Our future results of operations and other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross profit margin and costs, capital spending, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenses, potential impairment of investments, tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount, type and valuation of share-based awards granted, as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report. Our bookings increased 10.2% in 2011 as compared with 2010 , and our backlog at December 31, 2011 increased 3.7% as compared to December 31, 2010 , which is expected to generate increased revenue in 2012 as compared with 2011, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. Because a booking represents a contract that can be, in certain circumstances, modified or canceled, and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition, there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in a comparable increase in revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results. We expect a continued competitive economic environment in 2012; however, we anticipate benefits from planned increases in shipments from existing backlog, the continuation of our end user strategy, the strength of our high margin aftermarket business, continued disciplined cost management and our diverse customer base, broad product portfolio and unified operating platform. During the first half of 2012, we expect our results to be impacted by our efforts to further reduce our past due backlog and some large, low margin late project shipments, as well as a reduced level of aftermarket shipments as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. This is expected to result in our 2012 performance being weighted towards the second half of the year. While we believe that our primary markets continue to provide opportunities, as evidenced by eight consecutive quarters of over $1 billion in bookings and the year-over-year increase in our backlog, we remain cautious in our outlook for 2012 given the continuing uncertainty of global economic conditions. For additional discussion on our markets and our opportunities, see the "Business Overview Our Markets" section of this MD&A. 42 Table of Contents All of our borrowings under our Credit Facilities carry a floating rate of interest. As of December 31, 2011 , we had $330.0 million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. As a result of reducing the volatility, we may not fully benefit from a decrease in interest rates. We expect our interest expense in 2012 will be comparable to 2011 . However, because a portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest, our debt is subject to volatility in rates, which could negatively impact interest expense. Our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Annual Report. We expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt payments and pension plan contributions in 2012 . The amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues, cash advances, backlog, customer-driven delays and other factors. We seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory. In 2012, our cash flows for investing activities will be focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic expansion, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between $120 million and $130 million, before consideration of any potential acquisition activity. We have $25.0 million in scheduled repayments in 2012 under our Credit Facilities, and we expect to comply with the covenants under our Credit Facilities in 2012 . See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&A for further discussion of our debt covenants. We currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plan will be between $20 million and $25 million, excluding direct benefits paid, in 2012 in order to maintain fully-funded status, as defined by the U.S. Pension Protection Act. We currently anticipate that our contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $10 million in 2012 . CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 : Payments Due By Period Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Beyond 5 Years Total (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt $ 25.0 $ 100.0 $ 350.0 $ $ 475.0 Fixed interest payments(1) 0.8 0.5 1.3 Variable interest payments(2) 12.2 21.2 7.8 41.2 Other debt and capital lease obligations 28.6 1.6 30.2 Operating leases 48.7 71.4 38.6 31.0 189.7 Purchase obligations:(3) Inventory 601.7 8.5 610.2 Non-inventory 32.1 1.9 0.2 34.2 Pension and postretirement benefits(4) 50.8 104.1 108.5 295.9 559.3 Total $ 799.9 $ 309.2 $ 505.1 $ 326.9 $ 1,941.1 _______________________________________ (1) Fixed interest payments represent net incremental payments under interest rate swap agreements. (2) Variable interest payments under our Credit Facilities were estimated using a base rate of three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2011 . (3) Purchase obligations are presented at the face value of the purchase order, excluding the effects of early termination provisions. Actual payments could be less than amounts presented herein. (4) Retirement and postretirement benefits represent estimated benefit payments for our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical plans, as more fully described below and in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2011 , the gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $93.8 million. We do not expect a material payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months. We are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the uncertain tax positions. 43 Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at December 31, 2011 : Commitment Expiration By Period Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Beyond 5 Years Total (Amounts in millions) Letters of credit $ 419.6 $ 152.3 $ 5.7 $ 3.7 $ 581.3 Surety bonds 78.7 11.9 90.6 Total $ 498.3 $ 164.2 $ 5.7 $ 3.7 $ 671.9 We expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS Our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 715, "Compensation Retirement Benefits." In accounting for retirement plans, management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long-term rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, turnover, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding. Plan Descriptions We and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 71% of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately 59% of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the U.S. qualified plan as of December 31, 2011 . The assets for the U.S. qualified plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to all of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans. None of our common stock is directly held by these plans. Our U.S. defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of U.S. equity and fixed income securities. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets include a significant concentration of United Kingdom ("U.K.") equity and fixed income securities. In addition, certain of our defined benefit plans hold investments in European equity and fixed income securities as discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We monitor investment allocations and manage plan assets to maintain acceptable levels of risk. Benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants compensation and years of credited service. Assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2011 , the estimated fair market value of U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans increased to $495.1 million from $479.7 million at December 31, 2010 .

The projected benefit obligation ("Benefit Obligation") for our defined benefit pension plans was $658.8 million and $625.7 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2012 is $1.2 million. The estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2012 is $16.1 million. We amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net losses over the remaining expected service period or over the remaining expected lifetime for plans with only inactive participants. We sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. These plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies. We fund the plans as benefits are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. The benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees. The Benefit Obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was $35.0 million and $39.1 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2012 is less than $0.1 million. The estimated actuarial net gain for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2012 is $2.0 million. We amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net gain over the remaining expected service period of approximately three years. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions We account for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. Our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We, in consultation with our actuaries, evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits, such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets for funded plans, mortality rates, retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases, and determine such assumptions as of December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect Benefit Obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. See discussion of our assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the Our Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A. 45 Table of Contents In 2011 , net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in operating income was $37.8 million compared with $36.1 million in 2010 and $35.7 million in 2009 . The gain for the postretirement medical plans was $1.2 million in 2011 compared with $2.4 million in 2010 and $2.3 million in 2009 . The following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2011 : U.S. Plan Non-U.S. Plans Weighted average assumptions used to determine Benefit Obligation: Discount rate 4.50 % 5.09 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.25 3.56 Weighted average assumptions used to determine 2011 net pension expense: Long-term rate of return on assets 6.25 % 6.13 % Discount rate 5.00 5.13 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.25 3.46 The following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the U.S. qualified and aggregate non-U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement plans. Effect of Discount Rate Changes and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.2 ) $ 1.2 Effect on Benefit Obligation (13.5 ) 14.5 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (1.7 ) 2.2 Effect on Benefit Obligation (18.2 ) 20.1 U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense (0.2 ) 0.2 Effect on Benefit Obligation (1.1 ) 1.2 Effect of Changes in the Expected Return on Assets and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.7 ) $ 1.7 Effect on Benefit Obligation N/A N/A Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (0.7 ) 0.7 Effect on Benefit Obligation N/A N/A U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense N/A N/A Effect on Benefit Obligation N/A N/A As discussed below, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. At December 31, 2011 , as compared to December 31, 2010 , we decreased our discount rate for the U.S. plan from 5.00% to 4.50% based on an analysis of publicly-traded investment grade U.S. corporate bonds, which had a lower yield due to current market conditions. We decreased our average discount rate for non-U.S. plans from 5.13% to 5.09% based primarily on lower applicable corporate AA-graded bond yields for the U.K., partially offset by higher corporate AA-graded bond yields for the Euro zone. The average assumed rate of compensation remained constant at 4.25% for the U.S. plan and increased from 3.46% to 3.56% for our non-U.S. plans. To determine the 2011 pension expense, we decreased the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets from 46 Table of Contents 7.00% to 6.25% and we decreased our average rate of return on non-U.S. plan assets from 6.21% to 6.13% , primarily as a result of the decrease in the U.K. rate of return on assets. As the expected rate of return on plan assets is long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. We expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately $3 million higher in 2012 than the $37.8 million in 2011 , reflecting, among other things, the increased amortization of the actuarial net loss. We expect the 2012 net pension benefit for the postretirement medical plans to be $0.6 million lower than the $1.2 million in 2011 , primarily reflecting decreased amortization of the unrecognized prior service benefit. We have used discount rates of 4.50% , 5.09% and 4.25% at December 31, 2011 , in calculating our estimated 2012 net pension expense for U.S. pension plans, non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement plans, respectively. The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were 8.5% for 2011 , 9.0% for 2010 and 9.0% for 2009 , with a gradual decrease to 5.0% for 2032 and future years. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care. Plan Funding Our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs. We contributed $27.0 million, $50.2 million and $101.2 million to our defined benefit plans in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively. After consideration of our intent to remain fully-funded based on standards set by law, we currently anticipate that our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2012 will be between $20 million and $25 million, excluding direct benefits paid. We expect to contribute approximately $10 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2012 . For further discussions on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. The most significant estimates made by management include: timing and amount of revenue recognition; deferred taxes, tax valuation allowances and tax reserves; reserves for contingent losses; retirement and postretirement benefits; and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management, and management presents its views to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may differ from the estimates, and the difference may be material. Our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers, which is typically based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions. In addition, our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement, a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectability. We defer the recognition of revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and/or services have been performed. Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Our contracts typically include cancellation provisions that require customers to reimburse us for costs incurred up to the date of cancellation, as well as any contractual cancellation penalties. We enter into certain contracts with multiple deliverables that may include any combination of designing, developing, manufacturing, modifying, installing and commissioning of flow management equipment and providing services related to the performance of such products. Delivery of these products and services typically occurs within a one to two-year period , although many arrangements, such as "book and ship" type orders, have a shorter timeframe for delivery . We aggregate or separate deliverables into units of accounting based on whether the deliverable(s) have standalone value to the customer and when no 47 Table of Contents general right of return exists. Contract value is allocated ratably to the units of accounting in the arrangement based on their relative selling prices determined as if the deliverables were sold separately. Revenues for long-term contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost-to-cost basis. Percentage of completion revenue represents less than 9% of our consolidated sales for each year presented. Revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered. Revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract. These contracts can range in duration, but generally extend for up to five years . Fixed fee service contracts represent aproximately 1% of consolidated sales for each year presented. In certain instances, we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts. Failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non-recoverable costs. In instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable, we perform a project profitability analysis, accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues, which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project. In such instances, we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined. In circumstances where the total projected revenues still exceed total projected costs, the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition. Our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies. Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves We recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances, if necessary. We assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could, if successful, result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. While we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. Reserves for Contingent Loss Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable. Assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts, including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations. The recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter, changes in political environments, legal venue and other factors. Recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties, technological innovation and regulatory environment changes. Estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos-related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed, settled and dismissed, with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur, and are included in retirement obligations and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. A substantial majority of our asbestos-related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities. Estimated indemnities and receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos-related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries, which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers. Estimated receivables are included in other assets, net in our consolidated balance 48 Table of Contents sheets. In one asbestos insurance related matter, we have a claim in litigation against relevant insurers substantially in excess of the recorded receivable. If our claim is resolved more favorably than reflected in this receivable, we would benefit from a one-time gain in the amount of such excess. We are currently unable to estimate the impact, if any, of unasserted asbestos-related claims, although future claims would also be subject to existing indemnities and insurance coverage. Changes in claims filed, settled and dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, including former employees, and their beneficiaries. The assets, liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates, rates of compensation increases and other factors. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These assumptions are assessed annually in consultation with independent actuaries and investment advisors as of December 31 and adjustments are made as needed. We evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained, including appropriate rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation rates. We also compare our significant assumptions with our peers. The methodology to set our assumptions includes: Discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments. For the U.S. the discount rate is obtained from an analysis of publicly-traded investment-grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate. For plans in the United Kingdom and the EURO zone we use the discount rate obtained from an analysis of AA-graded corporate bonds used to generate a yield curve. For other countries or regions without a corporate AA bond market, government bond rates are used. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term high-quality debt securities, as well as the duration of our plans liabilities. Inflation assumptions are based upon both actual inflation rates and nationally expected trends. The expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies, expected long-term performance of asset classes, risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. These rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates. Retirement rates are based upon actual and projected plan experience. Mortality rates are based on published actuarial tables relevant to the countries in which we have plans. The expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels, seniority, age and other factors. Health care cost trend rates are developed based upon historical retiree cost trend data, long-term health care outlook and industry benchmarks. We evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations, cash flow requirements and other factors. We discuss our funding assumptions with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets The initial recording of goodwill and intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. We test the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. The test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units. In connection with our segment reorganization in 2010, we reallocated goodwill to our redefined reporting units and evaluated goodwill for impairment. The identification of our reporting units began at the operating segment level: EPD, IPD and FCD, and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purpose of testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions. These conditions included, among other factors, (i) the extent to which a component represents a business and (ii) the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments and resulted in nine reporting units. Other factors that were considered in 49 Table of Contents determining whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the methods of distribution and the types of industries served. Impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. We did not record an impairment of goodwill in 2011 , 2010 or 2009 . We also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill. Although our market capitalization declined compared with 2010, it did not decline to a level that indicated a potential impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2011. Impairment losses for indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a "relief from royalty" method, which estimates the fair value of the trademarks by determining the present value of the royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that have a significant impact on the fair value and are substantially consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above. We did not record a material impairment of our trademarks in 2011 , 2010 or 2009 . The net realizable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, is reviewed periodically, when indicators of potential impairments are present, based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing a methodology similar to that for goodwill. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS We have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
