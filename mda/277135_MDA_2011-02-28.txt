Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General . Grainger is a broad-line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies, and other related products and se rvices used by businesses and institutions. Grainger operations are primarily in the United States and Canada, with an expanding presence in Asia and Latin America. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives, direct marketing materials and catalogs. Grainger serves approximately 2.0 million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers, multiple websites and export services. Grainger two reportable segments are the United States and Canada. The United States segment reflects the results of Grainger U.S. operating segment. The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands Grainger Inc., Grainger Canadian operating segment. Other Businesses include the following operating segments which are not material individually and in the aggregate: MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (Japan), Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), Grainger Industrial Supply India Private Limited (India), Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto Rico), Grainger China LLC (China), Grainger Colombia SAS (Colombia), and Grainger Panama S.A. (Panama). Business Environment . Several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape Grainger business environment. & #160;The overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting Grainger growth. Historically, Grainger sales trends have tended to correlate with industrial production and non-farm payrolls. According to the Federal Reserve, overall industrial production increased 5.9% from December 2009 to December 2010. Both the United States and Canada GDP grew an estimated 2.9% in 2010. The improvement in the economy has positively affected Grainger sales growth for the twelve months of 2010. In February 2011, Consensus Forecasts-USA projected 2011 Industrial Production and GDP growth for the United States of 4.6% and 3.2%, respectively, and GDP growth of 2.6% for Canada. The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised approximately 25% of Grainger total 2010 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels in the United States increased approximately 1.2% from December 2009 to December 2010, while manufacturing output increased 0.9% from December 2009 to December 2010. This increase in manufacturing employment and output contributed to an upper teen percent increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a low double-digit percent increase in the light manufacturing customer sector for Grainger in 2010. Outlook . Grainger intends to take advantage of its strong financial position by continuing to make investments in growth such as hiring additional sales r epresentatives and on-site inventory services managers, and expanding product breadth and availability, and e-commerce capabilities, as well as the Company global presence. These investments should contribute to continued market share growth by helping businesses and institutions streamline their purchasing processes and reduce costs. As of January 25, 2011, Grainger forecasts 5 to 9 percent in sales growth and $7.15 to $7.90 of earnings per share for the full year of 2011. The sales growth for 2011, while still strong, is expected to be at a lower rate than 2010 primarily due to more difficult comparisons. The 2010 results reflect the effect of economic recovery as well as a one percentage point contribution from sales of products used to assist in the oil spill cleanup that will not repeat in 2011. Matters Affecting Comparability . There were 254 sales days in 2010, 255 in 2009 and 256 in 2008. Grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2010 and 2009, all of which were immaterial individually, and in the aggregate. Grainger operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates. 11 Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 15.4 % (9.2 )% Cost of merchandise sold 58.2 58.2 59.0 15.3 (10.4 ) Gross profit 41.8 41.8 41.0 15.7 (7.5 ) Operating expenses 29.9 31.1 29.6 11.0 (4.6 ) Operating earnings 11.9 10.7 11.4 29.4 (15.0 ) Other income (expense) (0.1 ) 0.7 (0.1 ) (115.9 ) (545.5 ) Income taxes 4.7 4.5 4.4 23.0 (7.2 ) Noncontrolling interest 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net earnings attributable to W.W. Grainger, Inc. 7.1 % 6.9 % 6.9 % 18.7 % (9.4 )% 2010 Compared to 2009 Grainger net sales of $7,182.2 million for 2010 increased 15.4% when compared with net sales of $6,222.0 million for 2009. There was one less selling day in 2010 versus 2009. Daily sales were up 15.9%. For 2010, approximately 10 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume, 4 percentage points came from business acquisitions, and 2 percentage points due to foreign exchange. Sales of products used to assist with the oil spill cleanup in the Gulf of Mexico and sales of seasonal products each contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the volume growth for 2010. Sales to all customer end-markets increased for 2010. The overall increase in net sales was led by a 30 percent increase to reseller customers, driven by sales of products used in the oil spil l cleanup, a high teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers, followed by a low double-digit increase in light manufacturing. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $3,005.7 million for 2010 increased 15.7%. The gross profit margin for 2010 was 41.8%, flat versus 2009. The gross profit margin was favorably affected by flat prices while product costs decreased, offset by faster sales growth from the lower margin international businesses and by an increase in sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins. Operating expenses of $2,145.2 million for 2010 increased 11.0% from $1,933.3 million for 2009. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions, bonuses and profit sharing costs due to improved performance, partially offset by a $33.1 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability. Operating earnings of $860.5 million for 2010 increased 29.4% from $665.2 million for 2009. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the strong sales growth and operating expenses which increased at a slower rate than sales. Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2010 increased by 18.7% to $510.9 million from $430.5 million in 2009. The increase in net earnings for 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings. Diluted earnings per share of $6.93 in 2010 were 23.3% higher than $5.62 for 2009, due to increased net earnings and fewer shares outstanding. There were two unusual non-cash items included in 2010 earnings, a $0.28 per share benefit from a change to a paid time off policy and a $0.15 per share tax expense related to the tax treatment of retiree healthcare benefits following the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which resulted in a net benefit of $0.13 per share. Results for 2009 included a $0.37 per share non-cash gain from the MonotaRO transaction in September 2009. 160;Excluding these unusual items from both years, net earnings increased 29.4% and earnings per share increased 29.5% in 2010 versus 2009. Segment Analysis The following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. United States Net sales were $6,020.1 million for 2010, an increase of $574.7 million, or 10.6%, when compared with net sales of $5,445.4 million for 2009. Daily sales in the United States were up 11.0%. Approximately 9 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume. In addition, acquisitions and price each added 1 percentage point. Sales to all customer end-markets except contractor customers increased for 2010. The overall increase in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent increase to reseller customers driven by the sales of products used to assist in the oil spill cleanup, a high teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers and a low double-digit increase to light manufacturing customers. 12 The segment gross profit margin increased 0.6 percentage point in 2010 over 2009. The gross profit margin benefited from price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by an increase in sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins. Operating expenses were up 6.0% for 2010 versus 2009. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions, bonus expense and profit sharing costs due to improved performance, partially offset by a $29.7 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability. For the segment, operating earnings of $920.2 million for 2010 increased 25.1% over $735.6 million in 2009. The improvement in operating earnings for 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin, and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. Canada Net sales were $820.9 million for 2010, an increase of $169.7 million, or 26.1%, when compared with $651.2 million for 2009. Daily sales were up 26.6% and in local currency, daily sales increased 14.9% for 2010. Contributing to the sales growth was 3 percentage points for acquisitions. The increase in net sales was led by growth to oil and gas, construction, and agriculture and mining customers. The gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage point in 2010 over 2009, primarily driven by lower product costs including the positive effect of foreign currency exchange on buying products in U.S. dollars. Operating expenses increased 32.0% in 2010. In local currency, operating expenses increased 19.7% primarily due to increased payroll and benefits costs including higher commissions and bonus expense, increased volume-related headcount and incremental costs for acquisitions made over the last year. Non-payroll related expenses also increased driven by higher travel, entertainment and advertising due to the sponsorship of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, and increased occupancy and warehouse costs driven in part by the incremental costs for a distribution center opened in the 2010 second quarter. Operating earnings of $46.8 million for 2010 were up $3.1 million, or 7.1%, versus 2009 due to the foreign exchange rate impact. In local currency, operating earnings decreased 1% primarily due to increased operating expenses as discussed above. Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China, Colombia and Panama, were up 136.1% for 2010. Daily sales increased 137.0%. The increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of results for Japan after obtaining controlling interest in September 2009 and Colombia, acquired in June 2010, along with strong growth from all the other international businesses. Operating earnings for other businesses were $11.7 million for 2010 compared to operating losses of $11.6 million for 2009. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $6.7 million of expense in 2010 compared with $42.1 million of income in 2009. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ (6,972 ) $ (7,408 ) Equity in net (loss) income of unconsolidated entities (182 ) 1,497 Gain on previously held equity interest net 47,343 Other non-operating income 1,608 964 Other non-operating expense (1,151 ) (283 ) $ (6,697 ) $ 42,113 The change from net income to net expense was primarily attributable to the one-time non-cash gain of $47.4 million in 2009 from the step-up of the investment in MonotaRO after Grainger became a majority owner. Income Taxes Income taxes of $340.2 million in 2010 increased 23.0% as compared with $276.6 million in 2009. Grainger effective tax rates were 39.8% and 39.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the tax rate in 2010 was primarily driven by a one-time tax expense related to the U.S. healthcare legislation passed in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding this one-time tax expense, the 2010 effective tax rate was 39.1%. For 2011, Grainger is estimating its effective tax rate to be approximately 39.2%. The increase is primarily due to a higher income tax rate adopted in the state of Illinois in the first quarter of 2011. 13 2009 Compared to 2008 Grainger net sales of $6,222.0 million for 2009 decreased 9.2% when compared with net sales of $6,850.0 million for 2008. There was one less selling day in 2009 versus 2008. Daily sales were down 8.8%. Sales were negatively affected by a decline in volume of approximately 14 percentage points, partially offset by price increases of approximately 5 percentage points. In addition, sales were negatively affected by 1 percentage point due to foreign exchange, while sales from acquisitions contributed approximately 1 percentage point. The overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector, followed by a low 20 percent decline in the reseller customer sector and a mid teen percent decline in the contractor customer sector. The govern ment customer sector performed the strongest as sales were flat for 2009, followed by a mid single-digit decline in the commercial customer sector. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $2,598.5 million for 2009 decreased 7.5%. The gross profit margin for 2009 increased 0.8 percentage point to 41.8% from 41.0% in 2008. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by an increase in the mix of sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins. Operating expenses of $1,933.3 million for 2009 decreased 4.6% from $2,025.6 million for 2008. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of lower headcount, profit sharing and incentive compensation. Non-payroll related expenses also decreased due to cost containment efforts. Operating earnings of $665.2 million for 2009 decreased 15.0% from $782.7 million for 2008. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to the decline in sales combined with operating expenses, which declined at a lower rate than sales. These declines were partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin. Net earnings for 2009 decreased by 9.4% to $430.5 million from $475.4 million in 2008. The decline in net earnings for 2009 primarily resulted from the decline in operating earnings, partially offset by the one-time non-cash pretax gain of $47.4 million ($28 million after tax) from the step-up of the investment in MonotaRO after Grainger became a majority owner in September 2009. Diluted earnings per share of $5.62 in 2009 were 5.9% lower than $5.97 for 2008, primarily due to the decline in net earnings, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. In the first quarter of 2009, Grainger adopted authoritative guidance regarding Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities, resulting in a seven cent reduction to the previously reported 2008 diluted earnings per share. Segment Analysis The following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. United States Net sales were $5,445.4 million for 2009, a decrease of $612.4 million, or 10.1%, when compared with net sales of $6,057.8 million for 2008. Daily sales in the United States were down 9.8%. All customer sectors were negatively impacted by economic conditions. The overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and in the reseller customer sector. The contractor and light manufacturing customer sectors declined in the mid teens and high single digits, respectively, while the government customer sector performed the strongest with flat sales for 2009. Beginning in 2006, Grainger has added approximately 234,000 new products to supplement the plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines as part of the business ongoing product line expansion initiative. The catalog issued in February 2010 offered a total of 307,000 products, an increase of 70,000 products over the 2009 catalog. The segment gross profit margin increased 1.3 percentage points in 2009 over 2008. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by an increase in the mix of lower margin sales to large customers. Operating expenses in this segment were down 4.6% for 2009. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of reduced headcount, lower profit sharing and no incentive compensation, partially offset by an increase in severance costs. Non-payroll related expenses also decreased due to cost containment efforts. For the segment, operating earnings of $735.6 million for 2009 decreased 12.5% over $840.4 million for 2008. This decrease in operating earnings for 2009 was primarily due to the decline in net sales and operating expenses which declined at a lower rate than sales, partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin. Canada Net sales were $651.2 million for 2009, a decrease of $76.8 million, or 10.6%, when compared with $728.0 million for 2008. Daily sales were down 10.2% and in local currency, daily sales decreased 3.9% for 2009. The decrease in net sales was led by declines in the heavy manufacturing and contractor customer sectors driven by economic conditions. Partially offsetting these declines were strong sales to the utilities customer sector driven by special projects, and to higher sales to the government. 14 The gross profit margin decreased 1.1 percentage points in 2009 over 2008. The decline in the gross profit margin was primarily due to cost increases exceeding price increases and an increase in the mix of lower margin sales, particularly to large customers. Operating expenses decreased 11.5% in 2009. In local currency, operating expenses decreased 5.6% primarily due to lower commissions and incentive compensation accruals, and non-payroll related expenses including lower travel and advertising costs. In addition, 2008 included expenses related to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services. Operating earnings of $43.7 million for 2009 were down $10.5 million, or 19.4%, versus 2008. In local currency, operating earnings decreased 15.6% primarily due to the decline in net sales and gross profit margin. Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China and Panama, were up 47.7% for 2009. Daily sales increased 48.3%. The increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of results from the acquisitions of the businesses in India and Japan, along with a positive contribution from China. Operating losses for other businesses were $11.6 million for 2009, a 1.6% improvement compared to operating losses of $11.8 million for 2008. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $42.1 million of income in 2009, an increase of $51.6 million as compared with $9.5 million of expense in 2008. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ (7,408 ) $ (9,416 ) Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 1,497 3,642 Gain (write-off) of investment in unconsolidated entities 47,343 (6,031 ) Other non-operating income 964 2,668 Other non-operating expense (283 ) (317 ) $ 42,113 $ (9,454 ) The change from net expense to net income was primarily attributable to the one-time non-cash gain of $47.4 million from the step-up of the investment in MonotaRO after Grainger became a majority owner in September 2009. In addition, 2008 included the write-off of a joint venture investment in India as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other operating income is lower primarily due to lower foreign currency transactions gains versus 2008. Income Taxes Income taxes of $276.6 million in 2009 decreased 7.2% as compared with $297.9 million in 2008. Grainger effective tax rates were 39.1% and 38.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the tax rate in 2009 was primarily driven by increased U.S. state tax rates. Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations, including growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchase of shares, as well as to pay cash dividends. Cash Flow Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 Cash from operating activities continues to serve as Grainger primary source of liquidity. Net cash flows from operations of $596.4 million in 2010 decreased $136.0 million from $732.4 million in 2009. Excluding business acquisitions, the decrease was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable of $127.8 million and inventories of $80.5 million, driven by the higher sales volumes. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net earnings. Net cash used in investing activities of $169.2 million in 2010 decreased $93.4 million versus $262.6 million in 2009. Net cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software of $120.6 million decreased $20.1 million from $140.7 million in 2009. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. In addition, net cash paid for business acquisitions decreased $61.0 million versus 2009. 15 Net cash used in financing activities of $578.6 million in 2010 increased $165.1 million from $413.5 million in 2009. Grainger repaid $239.1 million of long-term debt in 2010 and issued $200.0 million of commercial paper, resulting in a net use of cash. Cash paid for treasury share purchases of $504.8 million was $132.1 million higher than $372.7 million in 2009. Grainger repurchased 4.6 million shares in 2010 compared to 4.5 million shares in 2009. In 2011, treasury share repurchases are expected to be $210 million to $265 million. Fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 Net cash provided by operations of $732.4 million increased $202.3 million in 2009 versus $530.1 million in 2008. The increase was primarily driven by a decrease in inventories due to lower purchases in response to the slowdown in the economy and lower sales volumes. Partially offsetting the increase were lower net earnings of $44.6 million in 2009 versus 2008. Net cash used in investing activities of $262.6 million in 2009 increased $59.9 million versus 2008. The increase was primarily due to $123.1 million paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $88.8 million higher than in 2008. Net cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software was $140.7 million, $40.7 million lower than $181.4 million in 2008. Net cash used in financing activities of $413.5 million in 2009 was $376.7 million higher than $36.8 million in 2008. Proceeds from a four-year bank term loan of $500.0 million were included in 2008 and used to pay off $95.9 million in commercial paper. Cash paid for treasury stock purchases of $372.7 million was $21.5 million lower than $394.2 million in 2008. Grainger repurchased 4.5 million shares in 2009 compared to 5.5 million shares in 2008. Working Capital Internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt. In addition, funds are expended on facilities to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital was $1,368.8 million at December 31, 2010, compared with $1,354.7 million at December 31, 2009 and $1,382.4 million at December 31, 2008. At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8. Working capital and the current ratio were essentially flat over this three-year period. Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 63,358 $ 67,917 $ 107,688 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 51,965 63,667 76,163 Subtotal 115,323 131,584 183,851 Capitalized software 16,217 8,367 12,297 Total $ 131,540 $ 139,951 $ 196,148 In 2010 and 2009, significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the U.S. and Canada. Additional expenditures were for normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2008, Grainger substantially completed its investments in the market expansion program in the United States that realigned branches in the top 25 major metropolitan areas. In addition, there was continued international investment, including branch expansion in Mexico, as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $175 million to $200 million in 2011. Projected investments include continued investments in distribution centers, information technology, and the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger expects to fund 2011 capital investments from operating cash flows. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit. A four-year bank term loan of $500.0 million obtained in May 2008 was partially prepaid by proceeds from $200.0 million of commercial paper issued in 2010. Grainger available lines of credit were $400.0 million at December 31, 2010 and $250.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 17.8%, 19.1% and 20.7% as of the same dates. The reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily the result of the reduction in long-term debt. Grainger believes a ny circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 16 Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2010, Grainger contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows (in thousands of dollars): Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations $ 451,505 $ 31,059 $ 220,138 $ 200,055 $ 253 Interest on long-term debt 3,372 2,411 815 46 100 Operating lease obligations 201,563 45,461 72,787 48,471 34,844 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 54,323 53,923 192 208 Commitments to purchase inventory 272,052 271,720 332 Other purchase obligations 146,618 62,740 49,480 34,398 Other liabilities 346,540 154,009 19,091 21,405 152,035 Total $ 1,475,973 $ 621,323 $ 362,835 $ 304,583 $ 187,232 Purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. Other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections, and other employee benefit plans. Other employment-related benefits costs of $48.8 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 9 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to the interest on long-term debt and operating lease obligations, respectively. Grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of $36.0 million for tax uncertainties and interest at December 31, 2010. This amount is excluded from the table above, as Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which would have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 17 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts . Grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Based on analysis of actual historical write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable, Grainger estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts. However, write-offs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends, and Grainger estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes. For years 2010, 2009 and 2008, actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Inventory Reserves . Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. For fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. As Grainger inventory consists of approximately 800,000 stocked products, it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a SKU level and no individual SKU is material. There were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of write-offs historically. Grainger methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on curren t experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date. Actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on Grainger results of operations based on significant changes in product demand, market conditions or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, Grainger estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate. For fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets . Grainger business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment write-downs that Grainger may incur in future periods. Grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Grainger tests for goodwill i mpairment at the reporting unit level. Grainger tests indicated that the fair values were substantially in excess of carrying values and thus did not fail step one of the goodwill impairment test. Grainger determination of fair value requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability and cash flows of acquired businesses and market conditions. However, due to the inherent uncertainties associated with using these assumptions, impairment charges could occur in future periods. Stock Incentive Plans . Grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants. The model requires projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value of options granted in 2010, 2009 and 2008 used the following assumptions: For the Years Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Risk-free interest rate 2.9 % 2.4 % 3.2 % Expected life 6 years 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 24.7 % 28.8 % 25.2 % Expected dividend yield 2.0 % 2.3 % 1.8 % The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. Historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions. Because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, usin g historical forfeiture experience. The amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period. 18 Compensation expense for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant. For additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits . Postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates, and certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality rates. Changes in these and other assumptions (caused by conditions in eq uity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger postretirement benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. As of December 31, 2010, Grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 6.0% to 5.6% to reflect the decrease in market interest rates. Grainger estimates that this decrease in the discount rate will decrease 2011 pretax earnings by approximately $2.7 million, although other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor 500 Index and, beginning in 2010, the Total International Composite Index, in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2010, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax at 40%) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return. A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on December 31, 2010 results (in thousands of dollars): 1 Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 6,638 $ (5,071 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 54,257 (42,320 ) Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and, therefore, may affect Grainger retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves . Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels. In calculating the liability, historical trends, claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period results of operations. Grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied. There were no material adjustments based on Grainger historical experience in 2010, 2009 and 2008. If actual trends, including the nature, severity or frequency of claims differ from our estimates, or if business or economic conditions change, Grainger estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted. 19 Income Taxes . Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and uncertain tax positions. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. Other . Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets, fair value measurements and valuations, and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authori tative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inflation Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. Some of Grainger products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper or oil, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. Grainger has generally identified such forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate, anticipated, assumed, assumes, assumption, assumptions, believe, believes, continue, continued, continues to believe it has complied, continuing, could, estimate, estimated, estimates, expectation, expected, expects, forecast, forecasts, intended, intends, may, might, plans, predict, predictable, presumption, project, projected, projecting, projection, projections, potential, potentially, reasonably likely, scheduled, should, tended, timing and outcome are uncertain, unanticipated, will , will be realized, and would or similar expressions. Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although Grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Grainger results to differ materially from those which are presented. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward-looking statement include, without limitation: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of source of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions; general global economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; litigation involving appropriate payment for wages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 20
