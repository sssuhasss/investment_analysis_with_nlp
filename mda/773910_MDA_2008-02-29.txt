Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General Anadarko Petroleum Corporation primary line of business is the exploration, development, production, gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company major areas of operations are located in the United States and Algeria. The Company also has activity in China, Brazil and several other countries. The Company focus is on adding high-margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of exploring for and producing oil and gas. The primary factors that affect the Company results of operations include, among other things, commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, production volumes, the Company ability to find additional oil and gas reserves, as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko or Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. On August 10, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee in an all-cash transaction totaling $16.5 billion plus the assumption of $2.6 billion of debt. On August 23, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Western in an all-cash transaction totaling $4.8 billion plus the assumption of $625 million of debt. Anadarko initially financed $22.5 billion for the acquisitions under a 364-day committed acquisition facility. In conjunction with the 2006 acquisitions, Anadarko implemented an asset realignment program. The goal of the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions was to provide a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential, with the intent of divesting properties that were no longer deemed to be core to Anadarko operations. During 2007, the Company successfully completed the majority of the divestitures associated with the realignment program. Divestitures under the realignment program in 2007 and 2006 contributed proceeds of approximately $17 billion before income taxes. As expected, Anadarko proved reserves after completing the divestitures were about equal to levels before the acquisitions. For additional information about the benefits the Company believes are provided by the realigned portfolio, see Outlook . Through December 31, 2007, the Company had paid down its borrowings under the acquisition facility to $1.0 billion with proceeds from asset divestitures, long-term refinancing and free cash flow from operations. Unless noted otherwise, the following information relates to continuing operations and excludes discontinued Canadian operations. See Acquisitions and Divestitures, Outlook and Discontinued Operations for additional information. The following discussion pertains to Anadarko financial condition, results of operations and changes in financial condition.

During 2007, Anadarko changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from full cost to the successful efforts method. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, financial information for prior periods has been revised to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method, as prescribed by SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies. Although the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development continues to be an accepted alternative, the successful efforts method of accounting is the preferred method. The Company believes the successful efforts method provides a more transparent representation of its results of operations and the ability to assess the Company investments in oil and gas properties for impairment based on their estimated fair values rather than being required to base the valuation on prices and costs as of the balance sheet date. The effect of the accounting change on income from continuing operations for the full year ended December 31, 2007 was an increase of approximately $2.0 billion or $4.32 per diluted share. The effect of the accounting change on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was a decrease of $322 million or $0.69 per diluted share. The effect of the accounting change on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was a decrease of $98 million or $0.21 per diluted share. There was no effect on cash and cash equivalents. For additional information on the impact of the change to the successful efforts method of accounting see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Properties and Equipment, Note 2 Change in Accounting Principle and Note 8 Properties and Equipment of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Anadarko financial and operating results for 2006 include the operating results of Kerr-McGee and Western since the dates of their acquisitions. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Financial Results Net Income Anadarko income from continuing operations for 2007 totaled $3.8 billion, or $8.05 per share (diluted), compared to income from continuing operations for 2006 of $2.5 billion, or $5.33 per share (diluted). Anadarko had income from continuing operations in 2005 of $2.0 billion, or $4.15 per share (diluted). The increase in income from continuing operations for 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to gains on divestitures and higher sales volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower natural gas and oil and condensate prices, higher costs and expenses, including other taxes related to an Algerian exceptional profits tax, and higher interest expense. The increase in 2006 net income compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses and higher interest expense. In 2007 and 2006, the higher sales volumes, costs and expenses and interest expense were due primarily to the impact of operations acquired and debt incurred with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions. Results for 2006 were also impacted by charges associated with impairments of certain international properties. The Company sales revenues for 2007 and 2006 include $(1,048) million and $837 million, respectively, related to the recognition of net unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives used to manage price risk on natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs sales. The significant fluctuations in unrealized gains (losses) are due primarily to an increase in Anadarko derivative portfolio as a result of the 2006 acquisition of Kerr-McGee, as well as the discontinuance of hedge accounting effective January 1, 2007. The majority of the unrealized gains recorded in 2006 related to derivatives assumed with the Kerr-McGee acquisition. Unrealized gains (losses) related to derivatives were not material in 2005.

The decrease in prices for 2007 was largely attributed to the significant impact unrealized gains and losses on derivatives had on prices during 2007 and 2006. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and the significant impact unrealized gains and losses on derivatives had on prices. Gains on divestitures in 2007 related primarily to the Company asset realignment program. During 2007, net gains of $4.1 billion were related to divestitures of oil and gas properties and net gains of $0.6 billion were related to the divestiture of certain gathering and processing interests that generally were not affiliated with the Company operating areas. For additional information see, Acquisitions and Divestitures . The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage the risk of a decrease in the market prices for its anticipated sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. This activity is referred to as price risk management. The impact of price risk management (including realized and unrealized gains and losses) decreased total revenues $472 million during 2007 compared to an increase of $1,131 million in 2006. The impact of price risk management decreased total revenues $294 million during 2005. See Energy Price Risk under Item 7a and Note 10 Financial Instruments under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Analysis of Oil and Gas Operations Sales Volumes 2007 2006 2005 Barrels of Oil Equivalent (MMBOE) United States 180 147 106 Algeria 24 23 25 Other International 7 8 8 Total 211 178 139 Barrels of Oil Equivalent per Day (MBOE/d) United States 492 404 292 Algeria 65 64 66 Other International 20 21 22 Total 577 489 380 Anadarko daily sales volumes increased 18% in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to higher sales volumes of 138 MBOE/d associated with the full-period impact of the 2006 acquisitions and higher sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 18 MBOE/d associated with production start up at Independence Hub in the second half of 2007, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 64 MBOE/d associated with the impact of 2007 divestitures in the onshore United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Qatar. During 2006, Anadarko daily sales volumes increased 29% compared to 2005 primarily due to higher sales volumes associated with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions of 114 MBOE/d and higher sales volumes from the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by lower legacy gas volumes in east Texas and Louisiana, and lower oil sales volumes in Venezuela. Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future.

Anadarko daily natural gas sales volumes in 2006 increased 35% compared to 2005. The increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes of 423 MMcf/d associated with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions and higher volumes in the Haley field of West Texas, partially offset by natural declines in east Texas and north Louisiana. Production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Excluding the impact of gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average natural gas price for 2007 decreased 7% compared to 2006. The relative difference in 2007 and 2006 prices is primarily attributed to a higher than average North America natural gas storage level, the full year effect in 2007 of the return of Gulf of Mexico gas production capacity in 2006 that was damaged during the 2005 hurricane season and a significant increase in liquefied natural gas supply into the United States. Excluding the impact of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average natural gas price for 2006 decreased 17% compared to 2005. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has implemented price risk management on about two-thirds of its anticipated natural gas wellhead sales volumes for 2008.

Anadarko daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2006 were up 25% compared to the same period of 2005. The increases in 2006 compared to 2005 were primarily due to higher sales volumes associated with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions of 37 MBbls/d and additional wells being tied in and put into production at the Company legacy properties in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes from Venezuela. Production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Excluding the impact of gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average crude oil price for 2007 increased 14% compared to 2006. The higher crude oil prices were attributed primarily to additional global demand, limited excess production capacity and heightened geopolitical tension. Excluding the impact of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average crude oil price for 2006 increased 18% compared to 2005. The higher crude oil prices were attributed to continuing political unrest in oil exporting countries, increased worldwide demand and the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico on oil production and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has utilized price risk management on about half of its anticipated oil and condensate sales volumes for 2008.

Anadarko daily NGLs sales volumes in 2006 were up 17% compared to 2005, primarily due to higher sales volumes associated with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions of 6 MBbls/d. For 2007, the average NGLs price increased 16% compared to 2006. During 2006, average NGLs prices increased 15% compared to 2005. NGLs production is dependent on natural gas and NGLs prices as well as the economics of processing the natural gas to extract NGLs. NGLs sales represent revenues derived from the processing of Anadarko natural gas production. Gathering, Processing and Marketing Revenues millions 2007 2006 2005 Gathering and processing sales $ 1,259 $ 538 $ 26 Marketing sales 228 180 50 Total $ 1,487 $ 718 $ 76 During 2007, gathering and processing sales increased $721 million compared to 2006 primarily due to gathering and processing operations acquired with the 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease associated with divestitures in 2007. During 2006, gathering and processing sales increased $512 million compared to 2005 also due to the 2006 acquisitions. Gathering and processing revenues represent revenues derived from gathering and processing natural gas from sources other than the Company production. Marketing sales primarily represent the revenues earned on sales of third-party gas, oil and NGLs, net of the related purchases. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Costs and Expenses millions 2007 2006 2005 Oil and gas operating $ 1,101 $ 822 $ 415 Oil and gas transportation and other 453 341 256 Exploration 905 737 445 Gathering, processing and marketing 1,025 553 56 General and administrative 936 768 477 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,840 1,752 901 Other taxes 1,234 549 345 Impairments 51 327 15 Total $ 8,545 $ 5,849 $ 2,910 During 2007, Anadarko costs and expenses increased 46% compared to 2006 due to the following factors: Oil and gas operating expense increased 34% primarily due to approximately $227 million in operating expenses on properties acquired with the 2006 acquisitions, an increase of $71 million in expenses in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico related primarily to subsurface repairs and operating costs of Independence Hub which began production in 2007, a $28 million increase in costs associated primarily with the ramp up of activity in the Rockies and an increase of approximately $20 million related to severance cost associated with the Company post-acquisition asset realignment program. These increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately $66 million associated with properties divested during 2007. Oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased 33%. Transportation expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease associated with properties divested in 2007. Exploration expense increased $168 million due primarily to a $140 million increase in impairments of unproved properties, primarily associated with a significant increase in unproved leasehold interests as a result of the 2006 acquisitions, and a $28 million increase in dry hole expense related to international activities. Gathering, processing and marketing (GPM) expenses increased $472 million. Costs associated with gathering and processing operations increased $389 million primarily due to facilities acquired in 2006. Marketing transportation and cost of product increased $83 million primarily due to higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions and the assumption of firm transportation contracts in 2006. General and administrative (G&A) expense increased 22% primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit expenses of $158 million associated primarily to rising base compensation and benefit costs for employees, higher performance-based bonus expense and an increase in the average number of employees associated with the 2006 acquisitions. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense increased 62%. DD&A expense associated with oil and gas properties increased approximately $719 million as a result of operations acquired in 2006, approximately $367 million due to higher costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves and approximately $43 million due to higher organic sales volumes primarily associated with first production at Independence Hub in the Gulf of Mexico. Depreciation of other properties and equipment increased approximately $105 million primarily due to gathering, processing and general properties obtained with the 2006 acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $149 million related to oil and gas properties divested in 2007. Other taxes increased 125%. Other taxes include an increase of $602 million associated with the Algerian exceptional profits tax. The remaining increase of $83 million is primarily due to the effect of higher sales volumes on production taxes, the effect of a new Alaskan severance tax, the effect of a windfall profits tax in China and higher franchise taxes. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During 2006, Anadarko costs and expenses increased 101% compared to 2005 due to the following factors: Oil and gas operating expense increased 98% due primarily to $253 million in operating expenses for properties acquired with the 2006 acquisitions and $146 million associated with increased workover, maintenance and repair activity in the United States, an increase in expenses in the Gulf of Mexico associated with higher volumes, and rising utility and fuel expenses as a result of higher energy costs and industry demand. Oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased 33%. Transportation expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions. Exploration expense increased $292 million due primarily to a $173 million increase in dry hole expense related mostly to activities in the Gulf of Mexico, a $71 million increase in geological and geophysical costs and a $21 million increase in impairments of unproved properties, primarily associated with a significant increase in unproved leasehold interests as a result of the 2006 acquisitions. GPM expenses increased $497 million. Costs associated with gathering and processing operations increased $430 million primarily due to facilities acquired with the 2006 acquisitions. Marketing transportation and cost of product increased $67 million primarily due to higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions and the assumption of firm transportation contracts during the year. G&A expense increased 61% due primarily to increases of $117 million related to compensation, legal and other general expenses attributed to the operations acquired in the 2006 acquisitions, $77 million associated with rising compensation costs for legacy employees, $77 million related to severance and one-time benefits associated with Company initial post acquisition asset realignment and restructuring efforts and $28 million related to increases in general office expenses at legacy locations. DD&A expense increased 94%. DD&A expense associated with oil and gas properties increased approximately $566 million as a result of operations acquired in 2006 and approximately $219 million due to higher costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Depreciation of other properties and equipment increased approximately $66 million primarily due to gathering, processing and general properties obtained with the 2006 acquisitions. Other taxes increased 59%. The increase includes a $103 million accrual for the estimated impact of an Algerian exceptional profits tax. The remaining increase of $101 million is primarily due to the effect of higher production volumes and higher commodity prices on production taxes. Impairments in 2006 include a $166 million loss associated with the termination of the Venezuela operating service agreement in exchange for an 18% equity interest in a new operating company and a $139 million impairment related to the decision to suspend construction of the Company Bear Head LNG project in Nova Scotia. Interest Expense and Other (Income) Expense millions 2007 2006 2005 Interest Expense Gross interest expense $ 1,214 $ 730 $ 266 Capitalized interest (122 ) (80 ) (45 ) Net interest expense 1,092 650 221 Other (Income) Expense Interest income (84 ) (47 ) (17 ) Firm transportation keep-whole contract valuation 4 (56 ) Other 10 37 (3 ) Total other (income) expense (74 ) (6 ) (76 ) Total $ 1,018 $ 644 $ 145 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Expense Anadarko gross interest expense for 2007 increased 66% compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings associated with the 2006 acquisitions and higher interest rates compared to 2006. Anadarko gross interest expense increased 174% during 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt associated with the 2006 acquisitions. For additional information see Acquisitions and Divestitures and Debt below and Interest Rate Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10-K. In 2007, capitalized interest increased by 53% compared to 2006. In 2006, capitalized interest increased by 78% compared to 2005. These increases were primarily due to higher capitalized costs that qualify for interest capitalization. Other (Income) Expense For 2007, the Company had other income of $74 million compared to $6 million for 2006. The increase of $68 million was primarily due to higher interest income of $37 million, a $22 million loss on an impaired equity investment in 2006 and a $10 million loss related to environmental reserve adjustments in 2006. For 2006, the Company had other income of $6 million compared to $76 million for 2005. The decrease of $70 million was primarily due to a $60 million decrease in gains related to the effect of market values for firm transportation subject to a keep-whole agreement, a $22 million loss on an impaired equity investment and an $18 million loss related to environmental and legal reserve adjustments, partially offset by a $30 million increase in interest income. The keep-whole agreement was terminated April 1, 2006. Income Tax Expense millions except percentages 2007 2006 2005 Income tax expense $ 2,559 $ 1,263 $ 1,278 Effective tax rate 40% 34% 39% For 2007, income tax expense related to continuing operations increased 103% compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes and variances from the statutory rate. For 2006, income taxes decreased 1% compared to 2005 primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes resulting from enacted Texas legislation, excess U.S. foreign tax credits and a decrease in net foreign income taxes. The variance from the 35% statutory rate in 2007 is primarily caused by the Algerian exceptional profits tax which is non-deductible for Algerian income tax purposes, other foreign taxes in excess of federal statutory rates, state income taxes and other items. For 2006 and 2005, variances from the 35% statutory rate are caused by foreign taxes in excess of federal statutory rates, state income taxes, excess U.S. foreign tax credits and other items. Texas House Bill 3, signed into law in May 2006, eliminates the taxable capital and earned surplus components of the existing franchise tax and replaces these components with a taxable margin tax calculated on a combined basis. The new tax is effective for reports due on or after January 1, 2008 (based on business activity during 2007). Anadarko is required to include the impact of the law change on its deferred state income taxes in income for the period which includes the date of enactment. The adjustment, a reduction in Anadarko deferred state income taxes in the amount of approximately $14 million and $69 million, net of federal benefit, was included in the 2007 and 2006 tax provision, respectively. Operating Results Segment Analysis Adjusted EBITDAX To assess the operating results of Anadarko segments, management uses income from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, DD&A expense and impairments (Adjusted EBITDAX). The Company definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes exploration expense, as exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period, but is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A expense and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements as a measure of segment operating performance, as capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Anadarko definition of Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to the Company financing methods or capital structure. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions to shareholders. Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Anadarko, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and therefore, the Company consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with income from continuing operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Anadarko results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income from continuing operations before income taxes. Adjusted EBITDAX millions 2007 2006 2005 Oil and gas exploration and production $ 10,637 $ 7,350 $ 4,931 Midstream 894 183 108 Marketing 234 78 (21 ) Other and intersegment eliminations (548 ) (408 ) (183 ) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX $ 11,217 $ 7,203 $ 4,835 Exploration expense 905 737 445 Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense 2,840 1,752 901 Impairments 51 327 15 Interest expense 1,092 650 221 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 6,329 $ 3,737 $ 3,253 Oil and Gas Exploration and Production The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in gains on divestitures of $4.1 billion and higher sales volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower natural gas and oil and condensate prices and higher costs and expenses, including the Algerian exceptional profits tax. The increase in 2006 Adjusted EBITDAX compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses. In 2007 and 2006, the higher sales volumes and costs and expenses were due primarily to the impact of operations acquired with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions. The Company sales revenues include the impact of price risk management (including realized and unrealized gains and losses) which decreased total revenues $472 million during 2007, compared to an increase of $1,131 million in 2006 and a decrease of $294 million during 2005. Of these amounts for 2007 and 2006, $(1,048) million and $837 million, respectively, were related to the recognition of net unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives used to manage price risk on natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs sales. Unrealized gains and (losses) on derivatives were not material in 2005. Midstream The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007 compared to 2006 resulted primarily from an increase in gains on divestitures of $532 million related to midstream assets and an increased scope of midstream operations resulting from the 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in earnings associated with the 2007 divestitures. During July 2007, the Company divested its interests in two natural gas gathering systems and associated processing plants that did not operate in areas where Anadarko has significant oil and gas production. These divested facilities accounted for $75 million, or 21%, of Anadarko midstream segment adjusted EBITDAX excluding gains on divestitures during 2007. The increase in 2006 Adjusted EBITDAX compared to 2005 was also primarily due to the 2006 acquisitions. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Marketing Marketing earnings primarily represents the revenues earned on sales of third-party gas, oil and NGLs, net of the related purchases. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007 compared to 2006, as well as 2006 compared to 2005, resulted primarily from the effects of higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions. Other and Intersegment Eliminations All other and intersegment eliminations consists primarily of the elimination of revenues and expenses between segments, corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating segments and income from hard minerals investments and royalties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to increased interest expense from the 2006 acquisitions, increases in compensation expense from the increased average number of employees associated with the 2006 acquisitions and an increase in eliminations of intersegment transactions. The decrease in 2006 Adjusted EBITDAX compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher interest, compensation, legal and other general expenses attributed to the 2006 acquisitions as well as an increase in eliminations of intersegment transactions. Acquisitions and Divestitures In August 2006, Anadarko acquired Kerr-McGee and Western in separate all-cash transactions. Anadarko initially financed $22.5 billion for the acquisitions through a 364-day committed acquisition facility with plans to repay it with proceeds from asset divestitures, free cash flow from operations and the issuance of equity, debt and bank financing during the term of the facility. Through December 31, 2007, the Company had reduced the initial amount owed under the acquisition facility from $22.5 billion to approximately $1.0 billion, using divestiture proceeds, long-term debt financing and cash flow from operations. Kerr-McGee Transaction On August 10, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16.5 billion, or $70.50 per share, plus the assumption of $2.6 billion of debt. Kerr-McGee year-end 2005 proved reserves, excluding Gulf of Mexico shelf divestitures, totaled 898 MMBOE, of which approximately 62% was natural gas. Proved undeveloped reserves represented 30% of the total. Kerr-McGee legacy core properties are located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Colorado and Utah. They include deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks which are supported by Kerr-McGee hub-and-spoke infrastructure. In Colorado, Kerr-McGee holds acreage in the Wattenberg natural gas play, located largely on Anadarko Land Grant holdings, where Anadarko owns the royalty interest. In Utah, Kerr-McGee holds acreage in the Uinta basin prolific Greater Natural Buttes gas play. In addition to its U.S. portfolio, Kerr-McGee produces oil and is continuing to develop and explore offshore China, has made discoveries and is pursuing the development of fields offshore Brazil, and is exploring West Africa and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago. Western Transaction On August 23, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Western for $4.8 billion, or $61.00 per share, plus the assumption of $625 million of debt. Western year-end 2005 proved reserves totaled 153 MMBOE, with proved undeveloped reserves representing 57% of the total. Essentially all of the reserves are natural gas. Western coalbed methane properties within the Powder River basin are directly adjacent to Anadarko assets in this developing play. Anadarko believes that combining its properties with Western will accelerate the development of these natural gas resources and produce volume growth through the end of the decade, and possibly longer, with more than 12,000 identified drilling locations in inventory. The acquisition of Western also significantly increased the Company holdings in gathering and processing systems. Divestitures As a result of a portfolio refocusing effort stemming from the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, Anadarko divested certain properties during 2007 and 2006 for approximately $17 billion before income taxes. Net proceeds from these divestitures were used to retire debt. While the Company has identified some additional assets for possible monetization, the vast majority of producing property divestitures were closed by year-end 2007. During 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation, for approximately $4 billion before taxes. See Discontinued Operations . On the acquisition date, Kerr-McGee other assets included approximately $1 billion of assets held for sale. The sale of these assets closed in August 2006 and the proceeds were also used to pay down debt incurred to fund the acquisitions. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During 2007, the Company closed several unrelated divestiture transactions representing approximately $11 billion before income taxes. The most significant of these transactions are discussed below. In January 2007, the Company sold its interests in the Knotty Head and Big Foot oil discoveries, as well as the Big Foot North prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, for $0.9 billion. During February 2007, Anadarko also closed the sale of its Genghis Khan discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $1.3 billion. In March 2007, Anadarko divested control of its interests in 28 Permian basin oil and gas fields in West Texas for $1.0 billion (see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements ), sold its Vernon and Ansley fields located in Jackson Parish, Louisiana, for $1.5 billion and sold its interests in the Elk basin and Gooseberry area of the Northern Rockies for $0.4 billion. In April 2007, Anadarko sold its interests in the Williston basin area of the Northern Rockies for $0.4 billion. In May 2007, Anadarko sold its interests in certain natural gas properties in Oklahoma and Texas for $0.9 billion and also sold a 23% working interest in the K2 Unit in the Gulf of Mexico for $1.2 billion. Anadarko remains the K2 Unit operator with a 42% working interest. In June 2007, Anadarko sold certain of its interests in the Austin Chalk play in central and east Texas for $0.8 billion. In July 2007, the Company divested control of its interests in the Chaney Dell and Midkiff/Benedum natural gas gathering systems and associated processing plants for $1.9 billion (see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements ). In October 2007, the Company divested certain interests in Qatar for approximately $350 million. Anadarko used the net proceeds from this transaction to further reduce debt. For additional information, see Note 5 Discontinued Operations, Assets Held for Sale and Other Divestitures under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Proved Reserves Anadarko focuses on growth and profitability. Reserve replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability depends upon the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves, among other factors. Reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties. In conjunction with the August 2006 acquisition of Kerr-McGee and Western, Anadarko implemented an asset realignment program. The goal of the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions was to provide a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential, with the intent of divesting properties that were no longer deemed to be core to Anadarko operations. During 2007, the Company successfully completed the majority of the divestiture stage of the realignment program. As expected, Anadarko proved reserves were about equal to levels before the acquisitions. For additional information about the benefits the Company believes are provided by the realigned portfolio, see Outlook . The following discussion of proved reserves, reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves includes both continuing and discontinued operations. A breakdown of reserve information by continuing and discontinued operations is contained in the Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MMBOE 2007 2006 2005 Proved Reserves Beginning of year 3,011 2,449 2,367 Reserve additions and revisions 252 1,043 291 Sales in place (620 ) (287 ) (51 ) Production (212 ) (194 ) (158 ) End of year 2,431 3,011 2,449 Proved Developed Reserves Beginning of year 1,989 1,524 1,517 End of year 1,625 1,989 1,524 The Company proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2007 were 8.5 Tcf compared to 10.5 Tcf at year-end 2006 and 7.9 Tcf at year-end 2005. Anadarko proved crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves at year-end 2007 were 1.0 billion barrels compared to 1.3 billion barrels at year-end 2006 and 1.1 billion barrels at year-end 2005. Crude oil, condensate and NGLs comprised about 42%, 42% and 46% of the Company proved reserves at year-end 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Company engineers, are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. The available data reviewed include, among other things, seismic data, structure and isopach maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, reservoir pressures, individual well and field performance data, individual well and field projections, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs and product prices. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling. Sustained decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. Reserve Additions and Revisions During 2007, the Company added 252 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (purchases in place, discoveries, improved recovery and extensions) and revisions. The Company expects the majority of future reserve adds to come from positive revisions associated with infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in North America and the deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as through improved recovery operations, purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas. The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future. Additions During 2007, Anadarko added 131 MMBOE of proved reserves. The Company added 130 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in coalbed methane and conventional plays of the Rockies and the initial recognition of proved reserves at the Peregrino field in Brazil. During 2006, Anadarko added 1,118 MMBOE of proved reserves. Of this amount, 1,030 MMBOE were related to purchases in place primarily associated with the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western in August 2006. In addition, the Company added 88 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in core areas onshore in the United States. During 2005, Anadarko added 212 MMBOE of proved reserves. Of this amount, 207 MMBOE were added as a result of successful drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and fields in the north Louisiana Vernon, east Texas Bossier, west Texas Haley and Canadian Wild River areas and successful improved recovery operations in Wyoming. Revisions Total revisions in 2007 were 121 MMBOE or 4.0% of the beginning of year reserve base. The revisions were related primarily to the large onshore natural gas plays such as Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, and Pinedale and Jonah fields, where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as a positive revision, and the increase in oil and natural gas prices. Total revisions for 2006 and 2005 were (75) MMBOE and 79 MMBOE, respectively. Revisions in 2006 related primarily to performance revisions of (136) MMBOE mainly due to downward revisions of the Company reserves at the K2 complex in the Gulf of Mexico and adjustments in Algeria, and price revisions of (99) MMBOE primarily due to a significant decrease in natural gas prices since the end of 2005, partially offset by additional infill drilling reserve bookings of 160 MMBOE. Revisions in 2005 related primarily to additional infill drilling reserve bookings of 102 MMBOE, partially offset by the impact of government imposed limits on production in Venezuela, as well as a reduction of NGLs reserves in Algeria resulting from a change in project scope. Sales in Place In 2007, the Company sold properties located in the United States and Qatar representing 609 MMBOE and 11 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. In 2006, the Company sold properties located in Canada representing 248 MMBOE of proved reserves. In addition, sales in place included 39 MMBOE of proved reserves related to government imposed contract changes which resulted in the Company Venezuelan properties being exchanged for an equity interest in a new Venezuela operating entity. In 2005, Anadarko sold properties located in the United States, Oman and Canada representing 25 MMBOE, 25 MMBOE and 1 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. Future Net Cash Flows At December 31, 2007, the present value (discounted at 10%) of future net cash flows from Anadarko proved reserves was $28.9 billion (stated in accordance with the regulations of the Securities 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This present value was calculated based on prices at year-end held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. The increase of $3.3 billion or 13% in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily due to higher natural gas and oil prices at year-end 2007 and successful exploration and development, partially offset by the divestiture program. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarko proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. Midstream Strategies Anadarko invests in midstream (gathering and processing) facilities to complement its oil and gas operations in regions where the Company has natural gas production. The Company is better able to control the timing of development of its oil and gas properties and manage both the value received for, and cost of, gathering, treating and processing natural gas through its ownership and operation of these facilities. In addition, Anadarko midstream business provides gathering, treating and processing services for third-party customers, including major and independent producers. Anadarko generates revenues in its gathering and processing activities through various fee structures that include fixed-rate, percent of proceeds, or keep-whole agreements. The Company also processes a portion of its gas at various third-party plants. In 2006, Anadarko significantly increased the size and scope of its midstream business through the acquisitions of Western and Kerr-McGee. Anadarko currently has systems in eight states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana) located in major producing basins of the onshore United States. On October 15, 2007, Western Gas Partners, LP (the Partnership), a newly formed 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC relating to a proposed underwritten initial public offering of 18.75 million common units, representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership, plus an option for the underwriters to purchase up to an additional 2.81 million common units. The Partnership was initially formed by Anadarko, the indirect owner of the general partner of the Partnership, to own and develop midstream assets. Upon completion of this transaction, Anadarko expects to hold approximately 59% of the interests in the Partnership. Anadarko will retain indirect ownership of the general partnership interest in the Partnership and will continue to operate the Partnership assets pursuant to an omnibus agreement, a services and secondment agreement and a tax sharing agreement. Since gathering and processing assets support Anadarko oil and gas producing activities, Anadarko plans to maintain operational control of the assets and expects to continue to consolidate the results of that business in its financial statements. The Company expects to use proceeds it receives from this transaction to repay a portion of the midstream note payable to a related party discussed below. In December 2007, a midstream subsidiary issued a $2.2 billion note payable to a related party. See Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 and Debt below for additional information. Marketing Strategies The Company marketing department manages sales of its natural gas, crude oil and NGLs. In marketing its production, the Company attempts to maximize realized prices while managing credit exposure. The Company sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale. In 2007, the Company also engaged in sales of greenhouse gas emission reduction credits (ERCs) derived from CO 2 injection operations in Wyoming. The Company expects additional sales of ERCs in the future. The Company also purchases natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near Anadarko production. These purchases allow Anadarko to aggregate larger volumes, fully utilize transportation capacity, attract larger, creditworthy customers and facilitate its efforts to 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements maximize prices received for the Company production and minimize balancing issues with customers and pipelines during operational disruptions. The Company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company does not engage in market-making practices and limits its trading activities to natural gas, crude oil and NGLs commodity contracts. The Company trading risk position, typically, is a net short position that is offset by the Company natural long position as a producer. See Energy Price Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10-K. In an effort to protect the Company from commodity price risk stemming from the 2006 acquisitions, the Company entered into derivatives covering 72% and 55% of the acquired companies then expected production volumes for 2007 and 2008, respectively. This price risk management program employed collars and other derivatives, intended to help ensure a return on investment while maintaining upside potential that could result from higher commodity prices. In recent years, all segments of the energy market have experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition, liquidity and credit. This has been reflected in credit rating downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies. Anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third parties; however, in certain situations the Company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases. Natural Gas Natural gas continues to fulfill a significant portion of North America energy needs and the Company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue. Natural gas prices have varied over the last year, with an overall decline in prices during 2007. Price volatility persists due to a relatively tight supply and demand balance. Anadarko markets its natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets. Anadarko Energy Services Company (AESC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko, is a marketing company offering supply assurance, competitive pricing, risk management and other services tailored to its customers needs. The Company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. The Company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility. The Company owns a significant amount of natural gas firm transportation capacity that is used to help ensure access to downstream markets and provides the opportunity to capture incremental value when pricing differentials between physical locations occur. The Company also stores some of its purchased natural gas in contracted storage facilities with the intent of selling the gas at a higher price in the future. Normally, the Company will have forward contracts in place (physical delivery or financial derivative instruments) to sell the stored gas at a fixed price. Western and Kerr-McGee both have gas marketing organizations that are being incorporated into AESC. Kerr-McGee had a long-term gas sales contract with Cinergy (since acquired by Fortis). In 2006, approximately 50% of gas volumes and revenues associated with the Kerr-McGee acquisition were sold under this legacy contract. This contract was terminated in March 2007, and the associated volumes were integrated into the Company marketing operations. Crude Oil, Condensate and NGLs Anadarko crude oil, condensate and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Algeria and other international areas. Most of the Company U.S. crude oil and NGLs production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality and transportation. Oil from Algeria is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products such as jet and diesel fuel. Oil from China is sold by tanker as Cao Fei Dian (CFD Blend) to customers primarily in the Far East markets. CFD Blend is a heavy sour crude oil which is sold into both the prime fuels refining market and the heavy fuel oil blend stock market. The Company also purchases and sells third-party produced crude oil, condensate and NGLs in the Company domestic and international market areas. Included in this strategy is the use of contracted NGLs storage facilities and various derivative instruments. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2007 were divestiture transactions, cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the midstream subsidiary note to a related party. The Company used cash primarily to retire debt, to fund Anadarko capital spending program and to pay income taxes and dividends. Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2006 were the issuance of debt, cash flow from operating activities and divestitures. During 2006, the Company used cash primarily to fund the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, to fund its capital spending program, repurchase Anadarko common stock, pay dividends and retire debt as well as preferred stock. Anadarko primary source of cash during 2005 was cash flow from operating activities. The Company used 2005 cash flow primarily to fund its capital spending program, repurchase Anadarko common stock and pay dividends. In addition, the Company used $170 million of cash from the 2004 divestitures to retire debt in 2005. Following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows during the period. Forward-looking information related to the Company capital resources and liquidity are discussed in Outlook that follows. Divestitures During 2007, Anadarko derived significant sources of cash from its divestiture program. See Acquisitions and Divestitures . Proceeds from these divestitures were used to reduce debt and pay income taxes on taxable gains associated with the divestitures. Cash Flow from Operating Activities Anadarko cash flow from continuing operating activities in 2007 was $2.8 billion compared to $4.7 billion in 2006 and $3.2 billion in 2005. The decrease in 2007 cash flow was attributed to the impact of income taxes on divestitures and higher costs and expenses, partially offset by the impact of higher sales volumes associated with the acquisitions. The Company had tax payments of $2.3 billion in 2007 that significantly impacted cash flow from operating activities as a result of the taxable gains on the divestitures. This decrease was effectively offset by an increase in cash flow from investing activities where proceeds from divestitures are presented before income taxes. The increase in 2006 cash flow compared to 2005 was attributed to the impact of the acquisitions and higher commodity prices, partially offset by higher costs and expenses and slightly lower legacy sales volumes. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Company short-term changes in cash flow from operating activities. Anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk. Sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short-term, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in prior years. Anadarko long-term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement, the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations and the level of acquisition and divestiture activity. Debt At year-end 2007, Anadarko total debt was $14.7 billion compared to total debt of $23.0 billion at year-end 2006 and $3.6 billion at year-end 2005. During 2007, the Company repaid $10.5 billion in debt that was classified as current at December 31, 2006, primarily with proceeds from divestitures and the issuance of a long-term $2.2 billion midstream note payable discussed below. The increase in debt in 2006 was attributed primarily to borrowings associated with the 2006 acquisitions. In January 2008, Anadarko entered into forward-looking 18-month interest rate swaps effective March 2008 with an aggregate notional value of $1.0 billion whereby the Company will pay a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 2.74% and receive a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR rate. Anadarko discontinued hedge accounting on January 1, 2007, therefore all gains and losses associated with these swaps will be recorded to interest expense. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity and interest rates, see Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party In late December 2007, Anadarko and an entity formed by a group of unrelated third-party investors (the Investor) formed Trinity Associates LLC (Trinity). As discussed in Note 11 Unconsolidated Affiliates of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Trinity initial capitalization consisted of Anadarko $100 million cash contribution in 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements exchange for a common interest in Trinity and the Investor $2.2 billion cash contribution in exchange for a preferred interest. Trinity, a related party, extended a $2.2 billion loan to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko, referred to herein as Midstream Holding, which holds and operates midstream assets directly and through its subsidiaries. The Company used all of the loan proceeds received by Midstream Holding to repay a portion of the Company acquisition facility indebtedness. The principal balance owed by Midstream Holding to Trinity is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party. Midstream Holding obligations under the loan agreement are not guaranteed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation but are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of Midstream Holding subsidiaries. Capital Expenditures The following table shows the Company capital expenditures relating to continuing operations by category. millions 2007 2006 2005 Property acquisitions Development proved $ (591 ) $ 14,496 $ 44 Exploration unproved (293 ) 13,372 201 Development 2,805 3,084 1,910 Exploration 834 806 560 Total oil and gas costs incurred* 2,755 31,758 2,715 Less: Corporate acquisitions and property exchanges 1,001 (27,491 ) Less: Asset retirement costs (194 ) (158 ) (29 ) Less: Geological and geophysical, exploration overhead and delay rentals expense (261 ) (254 ) (162 ) Less: Amortization of acquired drilling rig contract intangibles (86 ) Total oil and gas capital expenditures 3,215 3,855 2,524 Gathering, processing and marketing and other 775 357 120 Total capital expenditures* $ 3,990 $ 4,212 $ 2,644 * Oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions, property exchanges and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and cost incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment on the consolidated statement of cash flows include certain adjustments that give effect for the timing of actual cash payments in order to represent a cash basis. Anadarko capital expenditures decreased 5% in 2007 compared to 2006. The Company capital spending increased 59% in 2006 compared to 2005. The 2007 decrease was primarily due to a decrease in development drilling and construction expenditures and a decrease in exploration lease acquisition activity, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures on gathering and processing facilities. The increase in 2006 resulted primarily from an increase in exploration lease acquisitions, offshore drilling completions, development of the CBM infrastructure and capital expenditures of the acquired companies. Additionally, all of the periods were impacted by rising service and material costs. The variances in the mix of oil and gas spending reflect the Company available opportunities based on the near-term ranking of projects by net asset value potential. Proved property acquisitions and unproved property acquisitions in 2007 include adjustments of $(600) million and $(484) million, respectively, related to finalizing the allocation of fair value to oil and gas properties acquired from Kerr-McGee and Western in 2006. The property acquisitions in 2006 related primarily to Kerr-McGee and Western. The property acquisitions in 2005 primarily related to exploratory nonproducing leases. Anadarko participated in a total of 1,823 gross wells in 2007 compared to 1,537 gross wells in 2006 and 688 gross wells in 2005. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table provides additional detail of the Company drilling activity in 2007 and 2006.

Dividends In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Anadarko paid $170 million, $167 million and $170 million, respectively, in dividends to its common stockholders (nine cents per share per quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in 1986. The amount of future dividends for Anadarko common stock will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The covenants in the Company credit agreement provide for a maximum capitalization ratio of 60% debt, exclusive of the effect of any non-cash writedowns. As of December 31, 2007, Anadarko capitalization ratio was 47%. Although the covenants of the agreement do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends, the Company could be limited in the amount of dividends it could pay in order to stay below the maximum capitalization ratio. Based on these covenants, retained earnings of approximately $6.6 billion were not limited as to the payment of dividends. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Anadarko also paid $3 million, $3 million and $5 million, respectively, in preferred stock dividends. In 2008, preferred stock dividends are expected to be $2 million. Common Stock Repurchase Program During 2005, a $2 billion stock buyback program announced in 2004 was completed and an additional $1 billion stock buyback program was authorized in November 2005. Shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During 2007, no shares were repurchased under the plan. During 2006 and 2005, Anadarko purchased 2.5 million and 21.6 million shares of common stock for $0.1 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, under these programs. The repurchase program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. At December 31, 2007, $636 million remained available for stock repurchases under the program authorized in 2005. Outlook The Company goals include continuing to find or acquire high-margin oil and gas reserves at competitive prices while keeping operating costs at efficient levels. Anadarko completed the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western in August 2006 in two separate all-cash transactions. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had reduced the initial amount owed under a facility that was used to finance the acquisitions to approximately $1.0 billion using divestiture proceeds, long-term debt financings and cash flow from operations. The Company expects to repay the remaining balance owed under the facility, which matures in March 2008, with proceeds from identified divestitures and excess cash, possibly supplemented with short-term 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements borrowings. As discussed previously, Anadarko intends to reduce its economic interest in certain midstream assets through the formation and initial public offering of a Master Limited Partnership. The net after-tax proceeds from this transaction will be used to reduce indebtedness under the midstream note payable to a related party. The objective of the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions was to provide a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential, with the intent of divesting properties that were no longer deemed to be core to Anadarko operations. During 2007, the Company successfully completed the majority of the divestiture stage of the realignment program. As expected, Anadarko proved reserves after completing the divestitures were about equal to levels before the acquisitions. The Company estimates that approximately 7% of the sales volumes for 2007 are associated with the properties which have been divested. The new portfolio is intended to be better balanced, with lower-risk U.S. onshore resource plays complementing the volatility inherent in the Company deepwater Gulf of Mexico and international programs. The Company believes the acquisitions and optimization of its portfolio provide: A more efficient collection of lower-risk, predictable and consistent producing properties; Access to high-impact exploration opportunities worldwide through an expanded leasehold position; A substantial inventory of identified prospects, which will help deliver value from the exploratory drilling program over many years to come; and Expanded technical capabilities, combining the exploration, development, project management and operational skill sets of all three companies. The Company has an approved 2008 capital spending budget of $4.7 billion. The Company has allocated about 65% of capital spending to development activities, 20% to exploration activities, 10% to gas gathering and processing activities, with the remaining 5% for capitalized interest and other items. The Company expects capital spending by area to be approximately 30% for the Rockies, 20% for the Southern region, 25% for the Gulf of Mexico, 15% for International and Alaska and 10% for Midstream. Emphasis will be on production growth in the Rockies, continued development in the Gulf of Mexico, including the start-up of the Blind Faith platform, and progress toward first production in Brazil that is expected in 2010. The Company capital discipline strategy is to set capital activity at levels that can be funded with operating cash flows. Anadarko believes that its expected level of cash flow will be sufficient to fund the Company projected operational program for 2008. If capital expenditures were to exceed operating cash flow, funds would be supplemented as needed by short-term borrowings. To facilitate such borrowings, the Company has in place a $750 million committed credit agreement, which is supplemented by various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then-quoted rates. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility. The Company policy is to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully supported by unused balances from its committed credit facilities. The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short-term borrowings by issuing long-term debt in the public or private debt markets. To facilitate such financings, the Company may sell securities under its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in September 2006. The Company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including property divestitures and additional borrowings, to secure funds when needed. Recent Activities Prices for the Company natural gas sales are a function of both the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices as well as basis differentials for various sales regions. The Company has been active recently trying to protect against wider basis differentials versus NYMEX index by utilizing basis hedges and firm transportation agreements. In January and February of 2008, the Company added to its existing NYMEX hedging program an additional 340 thousand MMBtu/d for 2009 using three-way option collars. The Company now has a total of 530 thousand MMBtu/d (0.5 Bcf/d) of 2009 natural gas hedged using three-way option collars. Averaging the total 2009 hedged position of the Company results in a floor of $7.50 per MMBtu in place until 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $5.45 per MMBtu, at which point the Company will receive market plus $2.05 per MMBtu for prices below $5.45 per MMBtu. Additionally, the price will be capped at $11.25 per MMBtu for gas prices above that level. For additional information on factors that could impact Anadarko future results of operations, cash flows from operating activities or financial position see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below and Risk Factors under Item 1a of this Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In 2007, Anadarko contributed certain of its producing oil and gas properties and gathering and processing assets, with an aggregate fair value of approximately $2.9 billion, to newly formed entities in exchange for noncontrolling mandatorily redeemable interests in those entities. Subsequent to their formation, the investee entities loaned Anadarko an aggregate of $2.9 billion, which the Company used to repay its acquisition-related debt. Anadarko has a legal right to setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees and the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the $2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of such notes does not affect Anadarko reported debt balance, since the notes and the carrying amount of Anadarko investments in the investees are presented on the consolidated balance sheet on a net basis. Note 11 Unconsolidated Affiliates of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K provides additional information with respect to each of these transactions. Completion of these transactions resulted in Anadarko divesting control of its interests in certain non-core exploration and production and midstream assets and operations, while retaining a participating 5% interest in profits, losses and residual value of the investees. With respect to each investee, liquidation of the investee or redemption of Anadarko interest in the investee is expected to result in Anadarko net-settling in cash its obligation under the corresponding note payable with the distributable value of its interest in the investee. The Company does not currently expect such net settlement to have a material effect on its future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Each of Anadarko noncontrolling interests in the investees is optionally redeemable by Anadarko or the controlling investor in or after 2022 and is mandatorily redeemable in 2037. Obligations and Commitments Following is a summary of the Company obligations as of December 31, 2007: Obligations by Period millions 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 Years Total Total debt* Principal current debt $ 1,397 $ $ $ $ 1,397 Principal long-term debt 2,052 1,877 9,032 12,961 Midstream subsidiary note payable to a related party 2,200 2,200 Interest 837 1,499 1,272 7,817 11,425 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 1,373 1,793 1,054 230 4,450 Production platforms 85 123 106 365 679 Other 69 122 80 81 352 Asset retirement obligations 15 87 92 907 1,101 Midstream and marketing activities 145 193 177 354 869 Oil and gas activities 475 633 142 12 1,262 * Excludes amount discussed above under Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include several drilling rig commitments that qualify as operating leases. Over the past three years, Anadarko has entered into several agreements to secure the necessary drilling rigs to execute its drilling strategy over several years. A previous review of the Company worldwide deepwater drilling inventory, along with the tightening deepwater and onshore rig market, led Anadarko to secure the drilling rigs it needs to execute its strategy. The Company believes these rig-contracting efforts offer compelling economics and facilitate its drilling strategy. The portion of lease payments associated with successful exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties. The Company also has $1.0 billion in commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities and aircraft. For additional information see Note 21 Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various transportation, storage and purchase agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas. The above table includes amounts related to these commitments. Oil and Gas Activities As is common in the oil and gas industry, Anadarko has various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities, which extend beyond the 2008 budget. The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work- related commitments of $1,262 million, comprised of $391 million in the United States, $45 million in Algeria and $826 million in other international locations. The Company also has option and swap contracts in place to manage price risk associated with a portion of its expected future sales of its oil and gas production. Both exchange and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments are subject to margin deposit requirements. Margin deposits are required of the Company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits. Given the Company price risk management position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements. During 2007, the Company margin deposit requirements have ranged from $21 to $119 million. The Company had margin deposits of $51 million outstanding at December 31, 2007. Marketing and Trading Contracts The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2007 regarding the Company marketing and trading portfolio of physical delivery and financially settled derivative instruments. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives is calculated. millions Marketing and Trading Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2006 assets (liabilities) $ 59 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during 2007 (52 ) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during 2007 2 Other changes in fair value 2 Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007 assets (liabilities) $ 11 Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2007 Assets (Liabilities) millions Maturity less than 1 Year Maturity 1-3 Years Maturity 4-5 Years Maturity in excess of 5 Years Total Marketing and Trading Prices actively quoted $ 12 $ (1 ) $ $ $ 11 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Environmental Anadarko is also subject to various environmental remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2007, the Company balance sheet included a $132 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which were incurred by companies that Anadarko has acquired. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information see Legal Proceedings Environmental Matters under Item 3 of this Form 10-K. Other In 2007 the Company made contributions of $16 million to its funded pension plans, $74 million to its unfunded pension plans and $22 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Contributions to the funded plans increase the plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used for current benefit payments. In 2008, the Company expects to contribute $15 million to its funded pension plans, $11 million to its unfunded pension plans and $22 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Future contributions to funded pension plans will be affected by actuarial assumptions, market performance and individual year funding decisions. The Company is unable to accurately predict what contribution levels will be required beyond 2008 for the pension plans; however, they are expected to be at levels similar to those planned to be made in 2008. The Company expects future payments for other postretirement benefit plans to be at levels similar to those made in 2007. For additional information on contracts, obligations and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense, Note 10 Financial Instruments, Note 21 Commitments, Note 12 Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 22 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans and Note 23 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Discontinued Operations In November 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation, for approximately $4 billion before income taxes. Accordingly, the Canadian oil and gas operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows. The following table summarizes selected data pertaining to discontinued operations. millions except per share amounts 2007 2006 2005 Revenues and other $ 24 $ 717 $ 925 Income from discontinued operations $ 18 $ 311 $ 444 Gain on disposition of discontinued operations 8 2,494 Income from discontinued operations before income taxes 26 2,805 444 Income tax expense 15 530 88 Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ 11 $ 2,275 $ 356 Earnings per common share from discontinued operations diluted $ 0.02 $ 4.91 $ 0.75 Annual sales volumes (MMBOE) 17 20 Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities $ 134 $ (178 ) $ 591 Capital expenditures $ $ 537 $ 417 Income from discontinued operations for 2007 related primarily to marketing activities that were exited during 2007 and the effect of foreign currency translation on the indemnity liability discussed in Note 23 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2006 increased compared to 2005 primarily due to the gain on the sale of Canadian operations, a decrease in Canadian tax rates and higher oil prices, partially offset by an increase in Canadian taxes associated with the gain on sale and a decrease in recognized sales volumes as a result of the November 2006 sale. Under the Company initial 364-day term loan agreement, the Company was required to use net cash proceeds from significant dispositions to repay debt. Because the Canadian assets were subject to this requirement, approximately $58 million of interest expense related to the portion of debt that was repaid with proceeds from the sale of the Canadian operations is included in results of discontinued operations for 2006. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Financial Statements and Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to determination of proved reserves, litigation, environmental liabilities, income taxes and fair values. In 2006, significant estimates were also involved in accounting for business combinations. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these policies and estimates with the Company Audit Committee. Change in Accounting Principle In the third quarter of 2007, Anadarko changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost to the successful efforts method. In accordance with SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, financial information for prior periods has been revised to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method, as prescribed by SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies. For additional information on the impact of the change to the successful efforts method of accounting see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Properties and Equipment, Note 2 Change in Accounting Principle and Note 8 Properties and Equipment of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. In connection with Anadarko August 2006 acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, the Company recorded goodwill for the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Purchase Price Allocation The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. Anadarko uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including information commonly considered by the Company engineers in valuing individual oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company assets and liabilities and carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost. Goodwill The Company is required to assess goodwill for impairment annually, or more often as circumstances warrant. The first step of that process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill. If the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then no impairment loss is required. The Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test, with no impairment indicated. Although Anadarko cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future, impairment charges may occur if the Company is unable to replace the value of our depleting asset base or if other adverse events (for example, lower sustained oil and gas prices) reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit. Proved Reserves Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) (2i), (2ii), (2iii), (3) and (4), are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the DD&A rate calculation and the financial statements. Unproved Leasehold Costs Leasehold acquisition costs are initially capitalized. Acquisition costs of unproved leaseholds are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed periodically for impairment individually, based on the Company current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. For unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs, such costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease terms of the leases at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon expiration. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Amortization of individual insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration expense. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $12.6 billion of capitalized unproved leasehold costs, primarily from its August 2006 acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western. Significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play (for example, Greater Natural Buttes area in the Rocky Mountain region), while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have had limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area. A majority of the Company unproved leasehold costs are associated with leases or concessions to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed. Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed by the Company continuing exploitation program. Ultimate recovery of potentially recoverable reserves in areas with established production generally has greater probability than in areas with limited or no prior drilling activity. A portion of the Company unproved leasehold costs are associated with the Company exploration program, in which drilling activities have not yet commenced or are inconclusive, and the disposition of such costs will be determined by the success of the Company exploration program. Another portion of the Company unproved leasehold costs are associated with the Land Grant acreage in which the Company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to explore and evaluate the acreage through a 10- to 12-year program. An estimate as to sensitivity to earnings if assumptions other than those used for impairment of unproved properties is impractical given the broad range and number of assumptions involved and the relatively low level of exploration activities which have occurred during 2007 on assets acquired in the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions. Suspended Exploratory Drilling Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory drilling costs associated with a discovery well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are under way and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are not likely to occur, associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company has capitalized costs on its consolidated balance sheet associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period. At December 31, 2007, suspended exploratory drilling costs were $308 million compared to $312 million at December 31, 2006. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairment of Assets A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may be greater than its future net cash flows. Impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over the asset fair value. Such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment, since the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices for oil, gas or NGLs; estimates of future oil and gas production; development and operating costs and the timing thereof; economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The Company estimates of future net cash flows used in the impairment assessments are inherently imprecise because they reflect management expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect management long-term outlook on prices, costs and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. Derivative Instruments Current accounting rules require that all derivative instruments, other than those that meet specific exclusions, be recorded at fair value. Quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value. If quotations are not available, management best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or on valuation techniques. The Company derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over-the-counter market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data. Option fair values are based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model and verified against the applicable counterparty fair values. Derivative accounting rules require that fair value changes of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be reported in current period earnings, rather than in the period the derivatives are settled and/ or the hedged transaction is settled. This can result in significant earnings volatility. Through the end of 2006, Anadarko applied hedge accounting to some of its commodity derivatives. Derivative accounting rules are complex, subject to interpretation in their application, and interpretative guidance continues to evolve. As a result of this accounting risk, effective January 1, 2007, Anadarko discontinued hedge accounting on all existing commodity and interest rate derivatives. Such a change did not affect Anadarko reported financial position or cash flows and did not require adjustments to previously reported financial statements. Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has defined benefit pension plans and supplemental pension plans that are noncontributory and a foreign contributory defined benefit pension plan. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Determination of the projected benefit obligations for the Company defined benefit pension and postretirement plans is important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the Company decisions for amounts contributed into the plans. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. Anadarko develops demographics and utilizes the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. Discount rate The discount rate assumption used by the Company is meant to reflect the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. The Company currently uses a yield curve analysis, for a majority of the plans, to support the discount rate assumption. This analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical Aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high-quality, non-callable, marketable bonds, then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow. The present values of the cash flows are then accumulated, and a weighted-average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates to the total present value of the cash flows. The consolidated discount rate assumption is determined by evaluation of the weighted-average discount rates determined for each of the Company significant pension and postretirement plans. The weighted-average discount rate assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2007 was 6.0% for pension plans and 6.25% for other postretirement plans. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Expected long-term rate of return The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2007 pension investment balances by category and projected target asset allocations for 2008. The expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital market projections, with consideration of actual five-year performance statistics for investments in place. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2007 was 7.75%. Rate of compensation increases The Company determines this assumption based on its long-term plans for compensation increases specific to employee groups covered and expected economic conditions. The assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases, promotions and general inflation. The weighted- average rate of increase in long-term compensation levels assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2007 was 5.0%. Health care cost trend rate The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. For year-end 2007 measurement purposes, the Company used separate assumptions of cost increase rates for medical, prescription drugs and dental benefits covered by the plans. A 7.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits was assumed for 2008, decreasing gradually to 5.0% in 2015 and later years. For prescription drug benefits, a rate of increase of 11.0% in the per capita cost was assumed for 2008, decreasing gradually to 5.0% in 2015 and later years. For dental care costs, the Company assumed a flat rate of increase of 5.0%. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation or administration, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel or consultants are utilized. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of various taxing jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by Company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although Company management believes its tax accruals are adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Recent Accounting Developments New Accounting Principles In April 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39 (FSP FIN 39-1) , which addresses certain modifications to FIN No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. The FSP provides for offsetting fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. FSP FIN 39-1 is effective for Anadarko as of January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2007, Anadarko had approximately $50 million in current assets for the right to reclaim cash for derivative instruments. Upon adoption in the first quarter of 2008, Anadarko will offset the right to reclaim cash collateral against net derivative positions for which a master netting agreement exists. Because FSP FIN 39-1 requires retrospective application, the Company historical balance sheets will be revised accordingly. Anadarko does not expect the impact to be material. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)), a replacement of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 (R) modifies the accounting for business combinations under SFAS No. 141 and will apply to Anadarko prospectively for future business combinations with an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as a component of consolidated equity. This is a change from the current practice to present noncontrolling interests in liabilities or between liabilities and stockholders equity. Similarly, SFAS No. 160 requires consolidated net income and comprehensive income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interests. Anadarko will be required to adopt accounting provisions of SFAS No. 160 prospectively with respect to transactions involving noncontrolling financial interests that occur on or after January 1, 2009. Presentation and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 160 will also be applied effective January 1, 2009, but with respect to all periods presented. After adopting SFAS No. 160 in 2009, the Company will apply provisions of this standard to noncontrolling interests created or acquired in future periods.
