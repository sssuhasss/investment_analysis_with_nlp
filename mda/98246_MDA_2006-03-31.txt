Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to the fiscal year that ends on January 31 of the following calendar year. 2005 HIGHLIGHTS Net sales rose 9% to $2.4 billion. Worldwide comparable store sales rose 5% on a constant-exchange-rate basis (see Non-GAAP Measures). Japan retail sales, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, increased 4% in 2005 while comparable store sales were flat after three years of declines. Management believes that the comparable store sales decline was stemmed due to new product introductions, initiatives in sales training and improvements in the economic environment. Net earnings decreased 16%, or $50 million, to $255 million. Prior year net earnings were not representative because they benefited from a $125 million gain, net of tax, from the Company sale of its equity investment in Aber Diamond Corporation ( Aber ). The Company repatriated $178 million in accumulated earnings from foreign affiliates, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate. Company-operated square footage of TIFFANY & CO. stores increased 2%. The Company added eight retail locations four in the U.S., two in Japan and one each in Australia and France. In addition, five existing locations were closed in Japan. E-commerce sites were launched in Canada and Japan. The Company sold and leased back its Retail Service Center (a distribution and administrative office facility) and received proceeds of $75 million. The Board of Directors increased the annual dividend rate by 33%. The Company repurchased 3.8 million shares of its Common Stock. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Internally, management monitors the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars ( constant-exchange-rate basis ). Management uses this constant-exchange-rate measure because it believes it is a more representative assessment of the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company operating results. TIFFANY & CO. K - 27 The following tables reconcile net sales percentage increases (decreases), versus the prior year, from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis: 2005 2004 Constant- Constant- GAAP Translation Exchange- GAAP Translation Exchange- Net Sales Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Worldwide 9 % 9 % 10 % 2 % 8 % U.S. Retail 9 % 9 % 10 % 10 % International Retail 5 % (2 )% 7 % 10 % 6 % 4 % Japan Retail (4 )% 4 % 1 % 6 % (5 )% Other Asia-Pacific 17 % 3 % 14 % 27 % 4 % 23 % Europe 4 % (3 )% 7 % 23 % 11 % 12 % 2005 2004 Constant- Constant- Comparable GAAP Translation Exchange- GAAP Translation Exchange- Store Sales Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Worldwide 4 % (1 )% 5 % 7 % 3 % 4 % U.S. Retail 7 % 7 % 10 % 10 % International Retail (2 )% 2 % 3 % 6 % (3 )% Japan Retail (4 )% (4 )% (2 )% 6 % (8 )% Other Asia-Pacific 10 % 2 % 8 % 15 % 4 % 11 % Europe (2 )% (3 )% 1 % 13 % 10 % 3 % RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Certain operating data as a percentage of net sales were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 44.0 44.2 42.1 Gross profit 56.0 55.8 57.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 40.1 42.4 40.1 Earnings from operations 15.9 13.4 17.8 Interest, financing and other income, net 0.5 0.8 0.7 Gain on sale of equity investment 8.8 Earnings before income taxes 15.4 21.4 17.1 Provision for income taxes 4.8 7.6 6.3 Net earnings 10.6 % 13.8 % 10.8 % TIFFANY & CO. K - 28 Net Sales 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Increase Increase U.S. Retail $ 1,220,683 $ 1,116,845 $ 1,013,034 9 % 10 % International Retail 900,689 857,360 781,572 5 % 10 % Direct Marketing 157,483 142,508 133,254 11 % 7 % Other 116,298 88,118 72,185 32 % 22 % $ 2,395,153 $ 2,204,831 $ 2,000,045 9 % 10 % A store sales are included in comparable store sales when the store has been open for more than 12 months. In markets other than Japan, sales of relocated stores are included if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. In Japan, sales of a new store or boutique are not included if the store was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. The results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base in all markets. In the second quarter of 2005, the Company placed responsibility for U.S. non-Internet business-to-business sales within the U.S. Retail channel and, consequently, now reports non-Internet business-to-business sales in that channel. In the past, such sales were reported in the Direct Marketing channel, which will continue to report Internet business-to-business transactions. The prior year amounts affected by the change have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. U.S. Retail . The following table presents the U.S. Retail channel and its components as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2005 2004 2003 New York Flagship store 10 % 10 % 10 % Branch stores 39 % 39 % 39 % Business-to-business 2 % 2 % 2 % 51 % 51 % 51 % U.S. Retail sales increased in 2005 and 2004. The New York Flagship store sales increased 5% in 2005 and 13% in 2004 and comparable branch store sales increased 7% in 2005 and 9% in 2004. Comparable store sales growth in both years resulted from increases in the average sales amount per transaction. Management attributes the increased amount per transaction to sales of higher-priced merchandise and management decision to reposition the Company silver jewelry category toward higher-priced offerings, as well as generally favorable conditions for consumer spending. In 2005, the Company experienced growth across a range of jewelry categories, with especially strong results in jewelry with diamonds which are at price points above the Company average. In both years, there were increased sales to U.S. customers, which account for the vast majority of U.S. Retail sales, and to foreign tourists especially in the New York Flagship store. The Company opened four new stores in both 2005 and 2004, consistent with its ongoing strategy to open three-five new U.S. stores each year. TIFFANY & CO. K - 29 International Retail . The following table presents the sales contribution in U.S. dollars of each geographic region within the International Retail channel as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2005 2004 2003 Japan 20 % 22 % 24 % Other Asia-Pacific 8 % 7 % 6 % Europe 6 % 6 % 6 % Other 4 % 4 % 3 % 38 % 39 % 39 % International Retail sales, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, increased 7% in 2005 and 4% in 2004. When compared with the prior year, the weighted-average U.S. dollar exchange rate was stronger in 2005 and weaker in 2004. Japan retail sales, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, increased 4% in 2005 and declined 5% in 2004. Comparable store sales were unchanged in 2005 and declined 8% in 2004. Management operational focus in Japan is on new products, targeted publicity and marketing, the quality of selling locations and selling skills. Although improvements in the Japanese economy were a positive factor, management believes that its focus on the above initiatives has contributed to the improved results in 2005, especially during the second half of the year. However, Japan sales will continue to be affected by increased luxury-goods competition. Japan sales of engagement and other fine jewelry increased in 2005 and 2004, while sales of silver jewelry declined in both years although at a lesser rate in 2005. In 2005, the Company opened two locations and five were closed, consistent with management intention to enhance the quality of its selling locations in Japan. In 2004, the Company opened four locations and one was closed. The Company also launched an e-commerce website in 2005. In the Asia-Pacific region outside of Japan, comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 8% in 2005 due to growth in all markets and 11% in 2004. In Europe, comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 1% in 2005 and 3% in 2004 due to growth in most markets, largely offset by a sales decline in the United Kingdom. Store Data . Gross square feet of company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores increased 2% to 745,000 in 2005, following a 9% increase to 729,000 in 2004. Sales per gross square foot generated by those stores were $2,666 in 2005, $2,546 in 2004 and $2,512 in 2003. Management expects further improvements in sales per square foot primarily due to comparable store sales growth. In addition, the Company newer U.S. stores use a smaller footprint than historically and are more productive. The Company worldwide expansion strategy is to open 8-12 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores and boutiques annually (excluding any closings). Plans in the U.S. for 2006 include opening a store in Nashville, Tennessee; Indianapolis, Indiana; Atlantic City, New Jersey; and Tucson, Arizona. International plans include new stores in Yonago and Mito, Japan; Monterrey, Mexico; Vancouver, British Columbia; Vienna, Austria; Macau; and second stores in Shanghai and Beijing, China. TIFFANY & CO. K - 30 Direct Marketing. Direct Marketing sales rose in both 2005 and 2004 due to increases in the average order size, which management attributes to a favorable consumer environment and new product introductions. The Company continues to experience increased website traffic and orders, as well as consumers shifting their purchases from catalogs to the Internet. While the number of catalog orders declined in both years, catalogs remain an effective marketing tool for both retail and Internet sales. Other. Other sales in 2005 and 2004 increased primarily due to wholesale sales of diamonds (such sales commenced in 2004), as well as sales growth in LITTLE SWITZERLAND stores (which represents the majority of Other sales). To a much lesser extent, sales in IRIDESSE stores, which commenced in late 2004, contributed to this channel sales growth. Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ( gross margin ) improved in 2005 by 0.2 percentage point and declined in 2004 by 2.1 percentage points. The increase in 2005 was primarily attributable to changes in geographic and product sales mix and selective price increases (0.6 percentage point), partially offset by increased low margin wholesale sales of diamonds (0.5 percentage point). Wholesale diamond sales are made to divest stones that do not meet Tiffany quality requirements; typically, the Company purchases such stones in mixed lots which are then culled. The decline of 2.1 percentage points in 2004 was primarily attributable to higher inventory costs due to increases in diamond and precious metal prices (1.0 percentage point); changes in geographic and product sales mix away from Japan and silver jewelry and toward higher-priced, lower-margin diamond jewelry (0.6 percentage point); the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (0.2 percentage point); and costs incurred to expand product distribution and sourcing/manufacturing capacity. The Company hedging program (see Note K to Consolidated Financial Statements) uses yen put options to stabilize product costs in Japan over the short-term despite exchange rate fluctuations. The Company adjusts its retail prices in Japan from time to time to address longer-term changes in the yen/dollar relationship and local competitive pricing. Management long-term strategy and objectives include achieving product sourcing/manufacturing efficiencies (including direct rough-diamond sourcing and increased internal manufacturing), controlling costs and implementing selective price adjustments in order to maintain the Company gross margin at, or above, prior year levels. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses SG&A expenses increased 3% in 2005. However, excluding several one-time costs in 2004 (a contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation, an impairment charge and exit costs (see below for more details)), SG&A expenses increased 7% in 2005 due to higher labor and benefit costs (representing approximately 50% of the increase) and higher depreciation and occupancy expenses attributable to new stores and variable rent (representing approximately 30% of the increase). In 2005, the Company recorded $2,201,000 of losses associated with the sale of the Company equity investment in a retail designer and distributor and $2,115,000 of losses associated with the sale of a glassware manufacturing operation. TIFFANY & CO. K - 31 SG&A expenses increased 17% in 2004, which included the following expenses that represented approximately half of the increase: $25,000,000 contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation. The contribution was made from the proceeds received from the Company sale of its equity investment in Aber. The Tiffany & Co. Foundation is a non-profit organization that provides grants to other non-profit organizations; $19,006,000 due to the early adoption, retroactive to February 1, 2004, of SFAS No. 123R; $12,193,000 impairment charge. In accordance with its policy on impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, the Company identified impairment losses in one of its international retail markets and in one of its specialty retail businesses as a result of store performance and cash flow projections; and $2,932,000 of exit costs associated with discontinuing a specialty retail concept that the Company decided not to pursue. In addition, the Company had higher labor and benefit costs in 2004 (representing approximately 20% of the increase), depreciation and occupancy expenses (representing approximately 15% of the increase) and marketing expenses (representing approximately 10% of the increase). Management long-term objective is to reduce the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales by controlling expenses so that sales growth will result in a higher rate of earnings growth. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses improved 2.3 percentage points in 2005. Excluding the one-time costs in 2004 discussed above, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 0.5 percentage point in 2005 due to overall sales growth. Earnings from Operations % of % of % of (in thousands) 2005 Sales* 2004 Sales* 2003 Sales* Earnings (losses) from operations: U.S. Retail $ 268,769 22 % $ 227,302 20 % $ 224,149 22 % International Retail 212,496 24 % 202,260 24 % 213,666 27 % Direct Marketing 58,542 37 % 47,566 33 % 46,813 35 % Other (18,829 ) (16 )% (23,290 ) (26 )% (8,460 ) (12 )% 520,978 453,838 476,168 Unallocated corporate expenses (138,273 ) (159,309 ) (120,649 ) Earnings from operations $ 382,705 $ 294,529 $ 355,519 *Percentages represent earnings (losses) from operations as a percentage of each segment net sales. Reclassifications were made to prior year earnings (losses) from operations by segment to conform to the current year presentation and to reflect the revised manner in which management evaluates the performance of segments. (See Note R to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the reclassifications that were made). Earnings from operations rose 30% in 2005. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations (before the effect of unallocated corporate expenses and interest, financing and other income, net) to each segment net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was as follows: TIFFANY & CO. K - 32 U.S. Retail increased 2 percentage points primarily due to increased sales and gross margin and the leveraging of fixed expenses; International Retail was consistent with the prior year; Direct Marketing increased 4 percentage points primarily due to increased sales and gross margin and the leveraging of fixed expenses; Other decreased loss of 10 percentage points primarily due to the absence of impairment and exit costs incurred in 2004. Excluding these charges from the 2004 loss from operations, the ratio of losses from operations to net sales would have been equal to the prior year. Earnings from operations declined 17% in 2004. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations (before the effect of unallocated corporate expenses and interest, financing and other income, net) to each segment net sales in 2004 compared with 2003 was as follows: U.S. Retail decreased 2 percentage points primarily due to shifts in product sales mix toward higher-priced, lower margin diamond jewelry and higher inventory costs; International Retail decreased 3 percentage points primarily due to product sales mix, higher inventory costs, increased import tariffs on U.S. manufactured products shipped to Europe and increased SG&A expenses; Direct Marketing decreased 2 percentage points primarily due to lower sales and higher fixed expenses, mostly associated with the Customer Fulfillment Center, a distribution facility, which opened in September 2003 and primarily supports the Direct Marketing segment; Other increased loss of 14 percentage points primarily due to impairment and exit costs incurred in 2004, expenses associated with the start-up and development of new specialty retail concepts and sales of diamonds unsuitable for the Company production, which earn a minimal to no gross margin. Each segment earnings (losses) from operations in 2005 and 2004 were affected by an allocation of the expense associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to the Company administrative support functions, such as information technology, finance, legal and human resources. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased 13% in 2005 and increased 32% in 2004. The 13% decrease in 2005 was primarily due to the $25,000,000 contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation made in 2004, which was partially offset by incremental labor and benefit costs. The 32% increase in 2004 was primarily due to the contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation, as well as incremental labor and benefit costs. Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense in 2005 was slightly higher than 2004. Interest expense in 2004 rose over 2003 due to a higher level of average borrowings, a higher weighted-average interest rate and lower capitalized interest on capital expenditures. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions, and minority interest income/expense. Other income, net increased in 2005 and 2004. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to increased interest income associated with a higher level of average investments and higher interest rates, as well as transaction gains on settlement of foreign payables. The TIFFANY & CO. K - 33 increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from a higher level of average investments and increased interest rates, as well as increased minority interest income. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment In December 2004, the Company sold its entire investment holdings of eight million shares in Aber, which had been acquired in July 1999, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $193,597,000, or a gain of $125,064,000 net of tax (see Liquidity and Capital Resources). Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 30.8% in 2005, compared with 35.6% in 2004 and 37.1% in 2003. The decrease in both years was primarily due to benefits associated with the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( AJCA ). The 2004 rate also benefited from the favorable state tax treatment on the gain from the Company sale of its equity investment in Aber, partly offset by a favorable reserve adjustment in 2003 related to the elimination of certain tax exposures. The AJCA, which was signed into law on October 22, 2004, created a temporary incentive for U.S. companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. This incentive effectively reduces the amount of U.S. Federal income tax due on repatriation. Taking advantage of the AJCA, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $8,600,000 in 2004 to reflect the Company plan to repatriate $100,000,000 of accumulated foreign earnings. In 2005, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $22,588,000 due to the Internal Revenue Service clarifying certain provisions of the AJCA in May 2005, which also resulted in the Company decision to repatriate additional foreign earnings. The tax benefit to the Company occurred because the Company had previously accrued income taxes on un-repatriated foreign earnings at higher income tax rates. In total, the Company repatriated $178,245,000 of accumulated foreign earnings. The AJCA provides a two-year transition from the existing Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000. The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) ruled that this exclusion was an illegal export subsidy. The European Union believes that the AJCA fails to adequately repeal illegal export subsidies because of these transitional provisions and has asked the WTO to review whether these transitional provisions are in compliance with the WTO prior ruling. Until the final resolution of this matter, management will be unable to predict what impact, if any, this will have on future earnings. 2006 Outlook Management financial performance objectives for 2006 are based on the following assumptions: Net sales growth of 10%. This objective assumes mid-single-digit worldwide comparable store sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis for the full year, including a high-single-digit increase in the U.S. and low-single-digit growth in Japan. Gross margin equal to fiscal year 2005. Improvement in the ratio of SG&A to net sales. Earnings before income taxes growth of at least 12%. Effective tax rate of 38%. Diluted earnings per share in a range of $1.77 $1.82. TIFFANY & CO. K - 34 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $262,691,000 in 2005, $130,853,000 in 2004 and $283,842,000 in 2003. The increase in 2005 resulted from increased net earnings after adjustment for the gain on the sale of the equity investment in Aber and smaller growth in inventories, partly offset by increased tax payments largely associated with a gain recognized on the sale of the Company equity investment in Aber in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decrease in 2004 resulted from a decrease in net earnings, after adjustment for the gain on the sale of the equity investment in Aber, and higher inventory purchases. Working Capital Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $1,334,233,000 and 4.7 at January 31, 2006, compared with $1,208,068,000 and 4.0 at January 31, 2005. Accounts receivable, less allowances, at January 31, 2006 were 7% higher than January 31, 2005. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 19 times in 2005 and 18 times in 2004. Inventories, net at January 31, 2006 did not change significantly from January 31, 2005. Combined raw material and work-in-process inventories increased 2% and finished goods inventories were approximately unchanged. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased inventories, net by 3% compared to January 31, 2005. The Company continually strives to improve its inventory management by developing more effective systems and processes for product development, assortment planning, sales forecasting, supply-chain logistics and store replenishment. Management expects a single-digit percentage increase in inventories in 2006. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $157,036,000 in 2005, $142,321,000 in 2004 and $272,900,000 in 2003, representing 7%, 6% and 14% of net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003. In all three years, expenditures were primarily related to the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution facilities and ongoing investments in new systems. In 2003, the Company purchased the land and building housing its Tokyo Flagship store for $140,400,000 (U.S. dollar equivalent at the acquisition date). In 2002, the Company acquired the property housing its Flagship store on Old Bond Street in London and an adjacent building at a total cost of $43,000,000 (U.S. dollar equivalent at the acquisition date), in order to renovate and reconfigure the interior retail selling space. Construction commenced in 2004 and is expected to be completed in 2006 at a cost of approximately $34,000,000. In 2000, the Company began a multi-year project to renovate and reconfigure its New York Flagship store in order to increase the total sales area by approximately 25%, and to provide additional space for customer service, customer hospitality and special exhibitions. The increase in the sales area was completed in 2001 when the renovated second floor opened to provide an expanded presentation of engagement and other jewelry. The renovated sixth floor that now houses the customer service department opened in 2002. The renovated fourth floor that offers tableware merchandise opened in 2003. The renovated third floor with silver jewelry and accessories opened in 2004. In conjunction TIFFANY & CO. K - 35 with the New York store project, the Company relocated its after-sales service functions and several of its administrative functions. The Company has spent approximately $89,000,000 to date for the New York store and related projects. Based on current plans, the Company estimates that the overall cost of these projects will be $110,000,000 when completed in 2006. Based on current plans, management estimates that capital expenditures will be approximately $170,000,000 in 2006. Acquisitions, Investments and Dispositions In October 2005, the Company acquired a Vietnamese corporation that specializes in polishing small carat weight diamonds. The price payable by the Company for the entire equity interest in this corporation is $2,000,000, of which $1,200,000 was paid in 2005; the balance will be paid when certain post-acquisition requirements are satisfied but no later than a fixed due date. This acquisition was not significant to the Company financial position, earnings or cash flows. The Company has made a $10,000,000 investment ($4,500,000 in 2004 and $5,500,000 in 2005) in a joint venture that owns and operates a diamond polishing facility in South Africa. The Company interest in, and control over, this venture are such that its results are consolidated with those of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company expects, through its investment, to gain access to additional supplies of diamonds that meet its quality standards. In December 2004, the Company sold its entire investment in Aber through a private offering. To gain Aber consent to the sale, the Company paid a fee and ceded its right to representation on Aber Board of Directors. Aber, in turn, paid the Company the present value of the right to purchase diamonds at a discount, under a purchase agreement, which obligates the Company to purchase, subject to availability and the Company quality standards, a minimum of $50,000,000 of diamonds per year through 2013. Inclusive of the payments described above, the Company received proceeds of $278,081,000, net of investment banking and legal fees, related to the sale of its equity investment. A pre-tax gain of $193,597,000 was recognized on the sale of the stock, and $10,843,000 was deferred related to the present value of the discount under the purchase agreement. As the deferred amount represents the present value of the discount, interest will be recorded on the deferred amount, and the undiscounted amount will be recognized as a reduction of inventory costs. The Company used $25,000,000 of the proceeds for a charitable contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation; management used the balance for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and additional investments to secure a greater supply of rough diamonds. The Company continues to maintain its commercial relationship with Aber through the diamond purchase agreement. In December 2002, the Company made a $4,000,000 investment in a privately-held company that designs and sells jewelry. In 2004 and 2003, the Company made additional investments of $2,500,000 and $4,500,000. In October 2005, the Company sold its equity interest and recorded a loss of $2,201,000 in SG&A expenses. The Company consolidated those results in its financial statements based on the percentage of ownership and effective control over the direction of the operations of the business. In September 2005, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement for its Retail Service Center, a distribution and administrative office facility. The Company received proceeds of $75,000,000 resulting in a gain of $5,300,000, which has been deferred and is being amortized over the lease term. The lease has been accounted for as an operating lease. The lease expires in 2025 and has two ten-year renewal options. TIFFANY & CO. K - 36 The Company continuously evaluates its manufacturing operations and supply chain to ensure that it has the optimal production mix to support long-term growth needs. In August 2005, the Company sold a glassware manufacturing operation. The Company recorded a loss of approximately $2,115,000 in SG&A expenses associated with the sale of the operation. Marketable Securities The Company invests excess cash in short-term investments and marketable securities. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company purchased $100,234,000, $383,989,000 and $27,450,000 of marketable securities and short-term investments. In addition, the Company received proceeds of $248,228,000 and $237,519,000 during 2005 and 2004 from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments. There were no sales during 2003. Dividends Cash dividends paid were $42,903,000 in 2005, $33,569,000 in 2004 and $27,700,000 in 2003. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 17% in 2005, 11% in 2004 and 13% in 2003. In May 2005, the Company Board of Directors declared a 33% increase in the quarterly rate on common shares, increasing it from $0.06 per share to $0.08 per share. In May 2004, the Company Board of Directors declared a 20% increase in the quarterly rate on common shares, increasing it from $0.05 per share to $0.06 per share. In May 2003, the Company Board of Directors declared a 25% increase in the quarterly rate on common shares, increasing it from $0.04 per share to $0.05 per share. Stock Repurchases In March 2005, the Company Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program ( 2005 Program ) that authorized the repurchase of up to $400,000,000 of the Company Common Stock through March 2007 by means of open market or private transactions. The 2005 Program replaced and terminated an earlier program. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depend on a variety of discretionary factors such as price and other market conditions. The Company stock repurchase activity was as follows: (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 2003 Cost of repurchases $ 132,816 $ 86,732 $ 4,610 Shares repurchased and retired 3,835 2,735 200 Average cost per share $ 34.63 $ 31.71 $ 23.05 At January 31, 2006, there remained $276,166,000 of authorization for future repurchases under the 2005 Program. At least annually, the Company Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flow and capital requirements for expansion. TIFFANY & CO. K - 37 Recent Borrowings The Company current sources of working capital are internally-generated cash flows and borrowings available under a revolving credit facility. In July 2005, the Company entered into a new $300,000,000 revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ) with an option to increase such commitments up to $500,000,000. The Credit Facility replaced the Company previously existing $250,000,000 credit facility and the $10,000,000 Little Switzerland unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility is available for working capital and other corporate purposes and contains covenants that require maintenance of certain debt/equity and interest-coverage ratios, in addition to other requirements customary to loan facilities of this nature. Borrowings may be made from eight participating banks and are at interest rates based upon local currency borrowing rates plus a margin that fluctuates with the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. The weighted average interest rate at January 31, 2006 was 3.59%. The Credit Facility expires in July 2010. In January 2006, the Company borrowed HKD 300,000,000 ($38,672,000 at January 31, 2006) ( Hong Kong Term Loan ), SGD 13,100,000 ($8,043,000 at January 31, 2006) ( Singapore Term Loan ) and CHF 19,500,000 ($15,145,000 at January 31, 2006) ( Switzerland Term Loan ) due in 2011. These funds were used to partially finance the repatriation of dividends related to the AJCA (see Provision for Income Taxes above). Principal payments of 10% of the original principal amount are due each year, with the balance due upon maturity. The covenants of the term loans are similar to the Credit Facility. Interest rates are based upon local currency borrowing rates plus a margin that fluctuates with the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. The interest rates for the Hong Kong Term Loan, the Singapore Term Loan and the Switzerland Term Loan were 4.28%, 3.65% and 1.28%, respectively, at January 31, 2006. In October 2004, the Company obligation to repay a yen 5,500,000,000 ($51,530,000 at maturity) borrowing came due and was paid in full, primarily with proceeds from a new yen 5,000,000,000 short-term loan. The yen 5,000,000,000 ($46,845,000 at issuance) short-term loan agreement was entered into in October 2004, had an interest rate of 0.59%, came due in January 2005 and was paid in full with existing funds. In September 2003, the Company issued yen 15,000,000,000 ($127,546,000 at January 31, 2006) of senior unsecured First Series Yen Bonds ( Bonds ) due 2010 with principal due upon maturity and a fixed coupon rate of 2.02% payable in semi-annual installments. The Bonds were sold in a private transaction to qualified institutional investors in Japan. The proceeds from the issuance were primarily used by the Company to repay the yen 11,000,000,000 ($91,938,000 at issuance) short-term bridge loan used to partially finance the purchase of the land and building housing its Tokyo Flagship store, which was entered into in June 2003 and matured in September 2003. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders equity was 26% at January 31, 2006 and 2005. At January 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. Based on the Company financial position at January 31, 2006, management anticipates that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows and the funds available under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to support the Company planned worldwide business expansion, share repurchases, debt service and seasonal working capital increases for the foreseeable future. TIFFANY & CO. K - 38 Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2006: (in thousands) Total 2006 2007-2008 2009-2010 Thereafter Operating leases $ 724,446 $ 94,526 $ 165,675 $ 131,468 $ 332,777 Inventory purchase obligations 501,293 151,293 100,000 100,000 150,000 Short-term borrowings and long- term debt 471,676 45,128 72,372 250,848 103,328 Interest on debt and interest- rate swap agreements a 90,786 19,666 38,690 25,930 6,500 Construction-in-progress 23,910 23,160 180 180 390 Non-inventory purchase obligations 6,677 6,677 Other contractual obligations b 9,609 7,250 1,259 1,100 $ 1,828,397 $ 347,700 $ 378,176 $ 509,526 $ 592,995 a) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company working capital needs. Variable-rate interest payments were estimated based on rates at January 31, 2006. Actual payments will differ based on changes in interest rates. b) Other contractual obligations consist primarily of royalty and maintenance commitments. The summary above does not include cash contributions for the Company pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company plans to contribute approximately $15,000,000 to the pension plan in 2006. However, this expectation is subject to change if actual asset performance is different than the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $1,242,000 in 2006. In addition, the summary above does not include the credit facility that the Company is providing to Tahera Diamond Corporation ( Tahera ), see below. The following is a summary of the Company outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Credit Facility and other lines of credit at January 31, 2006: Total Borrowings Available (in thousands) capacity outstanding capacity Credit Facility* $ 300,000 $ 38,818 $ 261,182 Other lines of credit 7,341 124 7,217 $ 307,341 $ 38,942 $ 268,399 *This facility matures in July 2010 and the capacity may be increased to $500,000,000. In addition, the Company had letters of credit and financial guarantees of $20,567,000 at January 31, 2006, of which $13,346,000 expires within one year. In November 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Tahera, a Canadian diamond mining and exploration company, to purchase or market all of the diamonds to be mined at the Jericho mine which has been developed and constructed by Tahera in Nunavut, Canada ( Project ). In consideration of that agreement, the Company provided a credit facility to Tahera which allows Tahera to draw up to CDN$35,000,000 (U.S.$30,536,000 at January 31, 2006) to finance the development and construction of TIFFANY & CO. K - 39 the Project. At January 31, 2006, CDN$29,718,000 (U.S.$25,927,000 at January 31, 2006) was outstanding under this credit facility. Principal and interest payments are due periodically throughout the term of the facility which matures in December 2013. The Company will begin purchasing diamonds from Tahera in 2006. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing a proportionally greater percentage of annual sales, earnings from operations and cash flow. Management expects such seasonality to continue. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records the effect of any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. At January 31, 2006, a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $2,200,000 in inventory and cost of sales. The Company domestic and foreign branch inventories, excluding Japan, are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, and inventories held by foreign subsidiaries and Japan are valued using the average cost method. Fluctuation in inventory levels, along with the costs of raw materials, could affect the carrying value of the Company inventory. Long-lived assets . The Company long-lived assets are primarily property, plant and equipment. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company recorded impairment charges of $10,230,000 in 2004 and did not record any impairment charges in 2005 and 2003. Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2005 evaluation did not result in any impairment charges; however, it is possible that impairment charges could be recorded in the future if results vary from those anticipated. Impairment charges recorded in 2004 amounted to $1,963,000 and no such charges were recorded in 2003. TIFFANY & CO. K - 40 Income taxes . Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ( tax filing positions ). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position and insist upon an adjustment. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company various tax filing positions, management records reserves for probable exposures. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. The Company also records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for current and retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used a discount rate of 6.00% to determine its 2005 pension and postretirement expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2005 pension and postretirement expenses by $3,105,000 and $245,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2005 pension and postretirement expenses by $3,363,000 and $275,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% to determine its 2005 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2005 pension expense by $670,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, the following annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed for 2006: 9.50% (for pre-age 65 retirees) and 10.50% (for post-age 65 retirees). The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2016 (for pre-age 65 retirees) and by 2018 (for post-age 65 retirees) and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would have increased the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2005 postretirement expense by $708,000. Decreasing the assumed health-care cost trend rate by one-percentage-point would have decreased the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2005 postretirement expense by $480,000. Equity Compensation Plans . The Company has equity compensation plans for employees and directors. Until January 2005, the Company granted only stock options. In January 2005, the Company, in addition to stock options, granted performance-based restricted stock units to executive officers of the Company and time-vesting restricted stock units to other management employees. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company early adopted SFAS No. 123R that requires new, modified and unvested share-based payment transactions with employees, such as stock options and restricted stock, TIFFANY & CO. K - 41 be measured at fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period (see Note B to Consolidated Financial Statements). The fair value of each option award is estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that requires the Company to develop estimates for assumptions used in the model. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses the following assumptions: expected volatility, expected term of the option, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. Expected volatility estimates developed by the Company are based on the historical volatility of the Company stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected term of the option; i.e. the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date. The dividend yield represents the expected dividends on the Company stock for the expected term of the option. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note B to Consolidated Financial Statements.
