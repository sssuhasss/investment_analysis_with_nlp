ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Forward-Looking Statements section therein for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our Company We believe that we are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products and services add value. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of Quick Response Centers ( QRCs ), we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. We currently employ approximately 15,000 employees in more than 50 countries. Our business model is significantly influenced by the capital spending of global infrastructure industries for the placement of new products into service and aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes. Over the past several years, we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings, as well as to provide business stability during various economic periods. The aftermarket business, which is served by more than 150 of our QRCs located around the globe, provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value-added services, and is generally a higher margin business and a key component of our profitable growth. As previously disclosed in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our 2010 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, we reorganized our divisional operations by combining the former Flowserve Pump Division and former Flow Solutions Division into Flow Solutions Group ( FSG ), effective January 1, 2010. FSG has been divided into two reportable segments based on type of product and how we manage the business: FSG Engineered Product Division ( EPD ) and FSG Industrial Product Division ( IPD ). Flow Control Division ( FCD ) was not affected. We have retrospectively adjusted prior period financial information to reflect our current reporting structure. Our operations are conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ): EPD for long lead-time, engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; IPD for pre-configured pumps and pump systems and related products and services; and FCD for engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators and controls and related services. The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, Valtek, Limitorque and Durametallic, which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. The products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world leading engineering, procurement and construction firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. We continue to build on our geographic breadth through our QRC network with the goal to be positioned as near to the customers as possible for service and support in order to capture this important aftermarket business. 30 Table of Contents Along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell, install and service our equipment in remote regions, it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations. We continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products. We continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands. We continue to focus on improving on-time delivery and quality, while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations, through the assistance of a focused Continuous Improvement Process ( CIP ) initiative. The goal of the CIP initiative, which includes lean manufacturing, six sigma business management strategy and value engineering, is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. We experienced improved demand for original equipment in 2010 as compared with 2009. As the effects from the global recession began to diminish, several demand forecasts improved, which promoted increased capital investment spending and planning. The oil and gas industry saw improved conditions as the developing regions economic growth plans rekindled projections of demand growth for oil and natural gas. Pipeline and refining investments were driven by infrastructure expansion plans in these growing regions. The developing regions also experienced improved conditions in the investment in chemical processing and power generation. In the mature regions, all three of these industries experienced a moderate level of investment. In the area of power generation, uncertainty over environmental regulations challenged spending levels, while overcapacity in oil refining affected capital investments. The water management industry displayed stability in its spending levels, as investments in this market persist in varying economic conditions. In 2010, we experienced improved demand in our global aftermarket business as compared with 2009. This was driven by our customers need to maintain continuing operations across several industries and the expansion of our aftermarket capabilities provided through our new integrated solutions offerings. Customers desire to gain operational efficiencies and increase throughput from existing facilities provided opportunities to leverage our engineering knowledge and technological capabilities to design solutions that produce the desired business result. A critical component of our growth strategy remains our investment in expanding our aftermarket capabilities to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings, as well as to provide business stability during various economic periods. In 2010, we continued to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all regions of the global market to capture aftermarket opportunities. We believe that with our customer relationships, our global presence and our highly regarded technical capabilities, we will continue to have opportunities in our core industries; however, we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multi-national presence, such as economic, political, currency and other risks. Our Markets The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Outlook for 2011 section included in this MD&A. Our products and services are used in several distinct industries: oil and gas; chemical; power generation; water management; and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as general industries. Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of new capital investment depends, in turn, on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas, power and water management, as well as general economic conditions. These drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior. The levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment, planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process. Our customers include engineering, procurement and construction firms, original equipment manufacturers, end users and distributors. Sales to engineering, procurement and construction firms and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications, as are certain sales to distributors. 31 Table of Contents Project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects. The quick turnaround business, which we also refer to as book and ship, is defined as orders that are received from the customer (booked) and shipped within three months of receipt. These orders are typically for more standardized, general purpose products, parts or services. Each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business. In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from a large installed base of our original equipment, which requires maintenance, repair and replacement parts. We use our manufacturing platform and global network of QRCs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. In geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response, we believe customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products. However, the aftermarket for standard products is competitive, as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products. As proximity of service centers, timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services, we continue to expand our global QRC network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business. Oil and Gas The oil and gas industry, which represented approximately 42% and 36% of our bookings in 2010 and 2009, respectively, experienced increased capital spending activity compared to the previous year due to improved demand outlook and the need to start the infrastructure build in order to bring future capacity on line in time. The majority of investment by the major oil companies was focused on the upstream production activities; however, there were improved levels of spending in both mid-stream pipeline and downstream refining operations particularly in the developing markets. Refining overcapacity remained a concern throughout the year in the mature regions as overall demand for oil fell in these regions. Aftermarket opportunities in this industry remained stable throughout the year. Opportunities presented by our integrated solutions offering helped to offset a reduction in service related business as many refineries performed this work with their own personnel. The outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies. We believe oil and gas companies will continue with upstream and downstream investment plans that are in line with projections of future demand growth and the production declines of existing operations. A projected decline in demand could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of spending, which could decrease demand for our products and services. However, we believe the long-term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on current supply, projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth. With our long standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream, mid-stream and downstream applications, along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings, we believe that we continue to be well positioned to pursue the opportunities in this industry around the globe. Chemical The chemical industry represented approximately 16% and 18% of our bookings in 2010 and 2009, respectively. This industry continued to experience challenges relative to capital investment due to the persistent uncertainty around the global economies and lingering recessionary effects in the mature regions. Projected demand growth and economic growth plans within the developing regions supported capital investment for capacity expansion and improvements, although the level of spending remained low compared to previous years. Agriculture was a leading driver of global chemical investment as the population of developing economies required greater food supply increasing the long-term need for fertilizer based products. The aftermarket opportunities remained stable for the majority of the year with signs of improvement in the latter part of the year. The outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions. As global economies stabilize and unemployment conditions improve, a rise in consumer spending should follow. An increase in spending will drive greater demand for chemical based products supporting improved levels of capital investment. We believe the chemical industry in the near-term will continue to invest in maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will continue investing in capital infrastructure to 32 Table of Contents meet current and future indigenous demand. We believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry. Power Generation The power generation industry represented approximately 17% and 20% of our bookings in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The power industry continued to experience some softness in capital spending in the mature regions driven by the uncertainty related to environmental regulations. In the developing regions, capital investment remained in place driven by increased demand forecasts for electricity in countries such as China and India. Global concerns about the environment continue to support an increase in desired future capacity from renewable and nuclear power. The majority of the active and planned construction throughout the year continued to utilize designs based on fossil fuels. Natural gas increased its percentage of utilization driven by market prices for gas remaining low and relatively stable. With the potential of unconventional sources of gas, such as shale gas, the power industry is forecasting an increased use of this form of fuel for generating plants. We believe the outlook for the power generation industry remains favorable. Current legislative efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have an adverse effect on investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country. It is important to note that proposed methods of limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services. We believe the long-term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth, advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets. We also believe that our long-standing reputation in the power generation industry, our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods, our advancements in serving the renewables market and carbon capture methodologies along with our global service and support structure position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry. Water Management The water management industry represented approximately 5% and 7% of our bookings in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems, many of which require products that we offer, particularly pumps. We believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continuing investments. The water management industry is facing a future supply/demand challenge relative to forecasted global population growth coupled with the advancement of industrialization and urbanization. Due to the limitations of usable fresh water around the globe, there continues to be an increased investment in desalination. This investment is forecasted to significantly increase over the next couple of decades. We believe we are a global leader in the desalination market, which is already an important source of fresh water in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. We expect that this trend in desalination will expand from these traditional areas to other coastal areas around the globe, which we believe presents a significant market opportunity for pumps, valves, actuation products and energy recovery devices. General Industries General industries comprises a variety of different businesses, including mining and ore processing, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, none of which individually represented more than 5% of total bookings in 2010 and 2009. General industries also include sales to distributors, whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve. General industries represented, in the aggregate, approximately 20% and 19% of our bookings in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010, we saw improving conditions in the majority of these businesses. Pulp and paper, mining and ore processing, as well as food and beverage, all saw improved conditions compared to 2009. This was generally supported by the improving economic conditions in several parts of the world. We also experienced increased business levels through our distribution network as business conditions improved and inventory levels required replenishment. 33 Table of Contents The outlook for this group of industries is heavily dependent upon the condition of global economies and the level of consumer confidence. The long-term fundamentals of many of these industries remain sound as many of the products produced by these industries are common staples of industrialized and urbanized economies. We believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide future business opportunities. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion of our results of operations, we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have calculated currency effects by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods. As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 ( Annual Report ), we acquired for inclusion in FCD, Valbart Srl ( Valbart ), a privately-owned Italian valve manufacturer, effective July 16, 2010. Valbart results of operations have been consolidated since the date of acquisition. We acquired for inclusion in EPD, Calder AG ( Calder ), a Swiss supplier of energy recovery technology, effective April 21, 2009. Calder results of operations have been consolidated since the date of acquisition. No pro forma information has been provided for either acquisition due to immateriality. As discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, beginning in 2009, we initiated realignment programs to reduce and optimize certain non-strategic manufacturing facilities and our overall cost structure by improving our operating efficiency, reducing redundancies, maximizing global consistency and driving improved financial performance, as well as expanding our efforts to optimize assets, responding to reduced orders and driving an enhanced customer-facing organization ( Realignment Programs ). To date, we have incurred charges related to our Realignment Programs of $86.4 million, including $18.3 million in 2010 and $68.1 million in 2009. We expect to incur approximately $5 million of additional charges for total expected Realignment Programs charges of approximately $91 million for approved plans. The Realignment Programs consist of both restructuring and non-restructuring costs. Restructuring charges represent costs associated with the relocation of certain business activities, outsourcing of some business activities and facility closures. Non-restructuring charges are costs incurred to improve operating efficiency and reduce redundancies, which includes a reduction in headcount. Expenses are reported in Cost of Sales ( COS ) or Selling, General and Administrative Expense ( SG&A ), as applicable, in our consolidated statements of income. Charges are presented net of adjustments relating to changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. Net adjustments recorded in 2010 were $5.8 million. 34 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our charges, net of adjustments, included in operating income in 2010 related to our Realignment Programs: Flow Solutions Subtotal Eliminations Group Reportable and Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2010 EPD IPD FCD Segments All Other Total (Amounts in millions) Restructuring Charges COS $ 2.3 $ 4.4 $ 1.9 $ 8.6 $ $ 8.6 SG&A (1.5 ) 0.3 0.9 (0.3 ) 1.2 0.9 $ 0.8 $ 4.7 $ 2.8 $ 8.3 $ 1.2 $ 9.5 Non-Restructuring Charges COS $ (0.1 ) $ 3.6 $ 2.4 $ 5.9 $ $ 5.9 SG&A 1.0 0.6 1.0 2.6 0.3 2.9 $ 0.9 $ 4.2 $ 3.4 $ 8.5 $ 0.3 $ 8.8 Total Realignment Program Charges COS $ 2.2 $ 8.0 $ 4.3 $ 14.5 $ $ 14.5 SG&A (0.5 ) 0.9 1.9 2.3 1.5 3.8 $ 1.7 $ 8.9 $ 6.2 $ 16.8 $ 1.5 $ 18.3 The following is a summary of our charges, net of adjustments, included in operating income in 2009 related to our Realignment Programs: Flow Solutions Subtotal Eliminations Group Reportable and Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2009 EPD IPD FCD Segments All Other Total (Amounts in millions) Restructuring Charges COS $ 14.5 $ 4.7 $ 0.5 $ 19.7 $ 0.7 $ 20.4 SG&A 9.9 0.3 0.2 10.4 1.4 11.8 $ 24.4 $ 5.0 $ 0.7 $ 30.1 $ 2.1 $ 32.2 Non-Restructuring Charges COS $ 9.8 $ 4.3 $ 7.0 $ 21.1 $ $ 21.1 SG&A 8.2 2.0 3.8 14.0 0.8 14.8 $ 18.0 $ 6.3 $ 10.8 $ 35.1 $ 0.8 $ 35.9 Total Realignment Program Charges COS $ 24.3 $ 9.0 $ 7.5 $ 40.8 $ 0.7 $ 41.5 SG&A 18.1 2.3 4.0 24.4 2.2 26.6 $ 42.4 $ 11.3 $ 11.5 $ 65.2 $ 2.9 $ 68.1 35 Table of Contents The following is a summary of total charges, net of adjustments, related to identified initiatives under our Realignment Programs expected to be incurred: Subtotal Eliminations Flow Solutions Group Reportable and Consolidated Total Expected Charges(1) EPD IPD FCD Segments All Other Total (Amounts in millions) Restructuring Charges COS $ 16.9 $ 10.7 $ 2.4 $ 30.0 $ 0.7 $ 30.7 SG&A 8.4 0.7 1.1 10.2 2.6 12.8 $ 25.3 $ 11.4 $ 3.5 $ 40.2 $ 3.3 $ 43.5 Non-Restructuring Charges COS $ 9.9 $ 10.1 $ 10.3 $ 30.3 $ $ 30.3 SG&A 9.2 2.5 4.8 16.5 1.1 17.6 $ 19.1 $ 12.6 $ 15.1 $ 46.8 $ 1.1 $ 47.9 Total Realignment Program Charges COS $ 26.8 $ 20.8 $ 12.7 $ 60.3 $ 0.7 $ 61.0 SG&A 17.6 3.2 5.9 26.7 3.7 30.4 $ 44.4 $ 24.0 $ 18.6 $ 87.0 $ 4.4 $ 91.4 (1) Total expected realignment charges represent management best estimate to date for approved plans. As the execution of certain initiatives are still in process, the amount and nature of actual realignment charges incurred could vary from total expected charges. Based on actions under our Realignment Programs, we have realized savings of approximately $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Upon completion of our Realignment Programs, we expect run rate cost savings of approximately $115 million. Approximately two-thirds of the savings from the Realignment Programs were and will be realized in COS and the remainder in SG&A. Actual savings realized could vary from expected savings, which represent management best estimate to date. Generally, the charges presented were or will be paid in cash, except for asset write-downs, which are non-cash charges. Asset write-down charges (including accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, accelerated amortization of intangible assets and inventory write-downs) of $6.4 million and $6.1 million were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Outlook for 2011 section included in this MD&A. Bookings and Backlog 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 4,228.9 $ 3,885.3 $ 5,105.7 Backlog (at period end) 2,594.7 2,371.2 2,825.1 We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer with regard to manufacture, service or support. Bookings recorded and subsequently canceled within the year-to-date period are excluded from year-to-date bookings. Bookings in 2010 increased by $343.6 million, or 8.8%, as compared with 2009. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $12 million. The overall net increase was primarily attributable to increased original equipment and aftermarket bookings in EPD, principally in the oil and gas industry, including the impact of an order in excess of $80 million for crude oil pumps, seals and related support services received in the second quarter of 2010. The increase is also attributed to higher bookings in FCD, driven by the oil and gas and general industries. These increases were partially 36 Table of Contents offset by the impact of orders of more than $45 million to supply valves to four Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear power units booked in 2009 that did not recur and decreased original equipment bookings in IPD. Bookings in 2009 decreased by $1,220.4 million, or 23.9%, as compared with 2008. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $216 million. These decreases were primarily attributable to declines in the oil and gas and general industries and reflect lower demand and customer-driven project delays due to a significant decrease in the rate of general global economic growth as compared with 2008. The decrease consisted of declines in original equipment bookings in EPD and IPD, including the impacts of the $85 million Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline order and the $110.9 million of thruster orders, respectively, that were recorded in 2008 and did not recur. The decrease was also attributable to declines in the chemical industry and orders from distributors in FCD, partially offset by orders of more than $45 million in FCD to supply valves to four Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear power units in North America. Backlog represents the accumulation of uncompleted customer orders. Backlog of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2010 increased by $223.5 million, or 9.4%, as compared to December 31, 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $51 million (currency effects on backlog are calculated using the change in period end exchange rates). The overall net increase included the impact of cancellations of $18.1 million of orders booked in prior years. By the end of 2011, we expect to ship 82% of our December 31, 2010 backlog. Backlog of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2009 decreased by $453.9 million, or 16.1%, as compared to December 31, 2008. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $87 million. The overall net decrease included the impact of cancellations in 2009 of $41.2 million of orders booked in prior years. Sales 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Sales $ 4,032.0 $ 4,365.3 $ 4,473.5 Sales in 2010 decreased by $333.3 million, or 7.6%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $32 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased original equipment orders across all divisions, primarily driven by lower beginning backlog in the oil and gas and general industries for 2010, as compared with 2009, reflecting lower demand and customer-driven project delays due to a significant decrease in the rate of general global economic growth in 2009. These decreases were slightly offset by increased aftermarket sales in EPD, driven by Latin America and Asia Pacific, and in FCD by sales provided by Valbart of $38.3 million. Aftermarket sales increased to approximately 39% of total sales in 2010 as compared with 36% in 2009. Sales in 2009 decreased by $108.2 million, or 2.4%, as compared with 2008. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $208 million. The overall net decrease was attributable to decreased chemical and general industries sales, decreased sales to distributors in FCD and decreased aftermarket sales by EPD. These decreases were mostly offset by increased original equipment sales in EPD, primarily in the oil and gas and general industries, driven by shipments of large original equipment project orders that were booked in 2008. In 2009, original equipment sales decreased approximately 4% as compared with 2008, and aftermarket sales were comparable to 2008. Sales to international customers, including export sales from the United States ( U.S. ), were approximately 73% of sales in 2010 compared with 73% of sales in 2009 and 69% of sales in 2008. Sales to Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMA ) were approximately 40%, 40% and 39% of total sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sales into the Asia Pacific region were approximately 18%, 20% and 18% of total sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sales to Latin America were approximately 10%, 9% and 8% of total sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 37 Table of Contents Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Gross profit $ 1,409.7 $ 1,548.1 $ 1,580.3 Gross profit margin 35.0 % 35.5 % 35.3 % Gross profit in 2010 decreased by $138.4 million, or 8.9%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included the effect of approximately $37 million in increased savings realized and a decrease of $27.0 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 of 35.0% decreased from 35.5% in 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to less favorable pricing from beginning of year backlog in EPD and IPD as compared with 2009 and the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, the effects of which were partially offset by a sales mix shift toward higher margin aftermarket sales in EPD and IPD, increased utilization of low-cost regions by FCD, positive impacts of our Realignment Programs and various CIP initiatives. Aftermarket sales generally carry a higher margin than original equipment sales. Aftermarket sales increased to approximately 39% of total sales in 2010, as compared with approximately 36% of total sales in 2009. Gross profit in 2009 decreased by $32.2 million, or 2.0%, as compared with 2008. The decrease included the effect of $41.5 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Gross profit margin in 2009 of 35.5% was comparable with 2008. Improved pricing on original equipment orders that were booked by EPD and FCD in 2008 and shipped in 2009, increased utilization of low-cost regions by FCD and EPD, various CIP initiatives and savings realized from our Realignment Programs were offset by a sales mix shift toward lower margin original equipment in EPD and IPD. Original equipment generally carries a lower margin than aftermarket. The sales of specialty pumps, which carry a higher margin, by EPD contributed to higher gross profit margins in 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Expense ( SG&A ) 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) SG&A $ 845.0 $ 934.5 $ 981.6 SG&A as a percentage of sales 21.0 % 21.4 % 21.9 % SG&A in 2010 decreased by $89.5 million, or 9.6%, as compared with 2009. Currency effects yielded a decrease of approximately $2 million. The decrease included the effect of approximately $23 million in increased savings realized and a decrease of $22.8 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to positive impacts from our Realignment Programs, decreased selling and marketing-related expenses, strict cost control actions in 2010 and legal fees and accrued resolution costs in 2009 related to shareholder class action litigation (which was resolved in the second quarter of 2010) that did not recur, partially offset by cash recoveries of bad debt and the adjustment of contingent consideration in 2009 noted below that did not recur. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2010 improved 40 basis points as compared with 2009. SG&A in 2009 decreased by $47.1 million, or 4.8%, as compared with 2008. SG&A included the effect of $26.6 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $32 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $42.6 million decrease in selling and marketing-related expenses, which is consistent with decreased bookings and sales. Cash recoveries of bad debts of $5.0 million that were reserved in 2008, a $4.4 million benefit from the adjustment of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Calder (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report), strict cost control actions and savings realized from our Realignment Programs were partially offset by an increase in legal fees and accrued resolution costs related to now-resolved shareholder class action litigation and charges resulting from our Realignment Programs. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2009 improved 50 basis points as compared with 2008, primarily as a result of decreased selling and marketing-related expenses. 38 Table of Contents Net Earnings from Affiliates 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Net earnings from affiliates $ 16.6 $ 15.8 $ 17.0 Net earnings from affiliates represents our net income from investments in seven joint ventures (one located in each of China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates and two located in India) that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Net earnings from affiliates in 2010 increased by $0.8 million, or 5.1%, as compared with 2009, primarily due to increased earnings of our EPD joint ventures in South Korea and India, partially offset by decreased earnings of our FCD joint venture in India and our EPD joint venture in Japan. Net earnings from affiliates in 2009 decreased by $1.2 million as compared with 2008, primarily attributable to our FCD joint venture in India and the impact of the consolidation of Niigata Worthington Company, Ltd. ( Niigata ) in the first quarter of 2008 when we purchased the remaining 50% interest. Operating Income 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Operating income $ 581.4 $ 629.5 $ 615.7 Operating income as a percentage of sales 14.4 % 14.4 % 13.8 % Operating income in 2010 decreased by $48.1 million, or 7.6% as compared with 2009. Operating income included the effect of approximately $60 million in increased savings realized and a decrease of $49.8 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, and included negative currency effects of approximately $4 million. The overall net decrease was primarily a result of the $138.4 million decrease in gross profit, which was partially offset by the $89.5 million decrease in SG&A, as discussed above. Operating income in 2009 increased by $13.8 million, or 2.2%, as compared with 2008. The increase included the effect of $68.1 million in charges from our Realignment Programs in 2009, mostly offset by savings realized from our Realignment Programs. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $48 million. The overall net increase was primarily a result of the $47.1 million decrease in SG&A, partially offset by the $32.2 million decrease in gross profit, discussed above. Interest Expense and Interest Income 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Interest expense $ (34.3 ) $ (40.0 ) $ (51.3 ) Interest income 1.6 3.2 8.4 Interest expense in 2010 decreased by $5.7 million as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of decreased interest rates. Interest expense decreased by $11.3 million in 2009 as compared with 2008, primarily as a result of decreased interest rates. At December 31, 2010, approximately 68% of our debt was at fixed rates, including the effects of $350.0 million of notional interest rate swaps. Interest income in 2010 decreased by $1.6 million as compared with 2009 due primarily to decreased interest rates. Interest income in 2009 decreased by $5.2 million as compared with 2008 due to decreased interest rates. Other (Expense) Income, net 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Other (expense) income, net $ (18.3 ) $ (8.0 ) $ 20.2 Other (expense) income, net in 2010 increased $10.3 million, or 128.8%, to expense of $18.3 million, as compared with 2009, primarily due to a $13.9 million increase in losses on forward exchange contracts and a $4.8 million increase in losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites functional currencies. Both of the above-mentioned changes primarily reflected the strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus 39 Table of Contents the Euro. Also included in the increase in losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our site functional currencies is the impact of the $12.4 million loss during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of Venezuela devaluation of the Bolivar, partially offset by realized foreign currency exchange gains of $4.8 million related to the settlement of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities at the more favorable essential items rate of 2.60 Bolivars to the U.S. dollar. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on the impact of Venezuela currency devaluation. In addition, we expensed $1.6 million in loan costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facilities in the fourth quarter of 2010. The above losses were partially offset by miscellaneous gains and income, the largest of which was a $3.1 million gain on the sale of an investment in a joint venture in 2010 that was accounted for under the cost method. Other (expense) income, net in 2009 decreased to net other expense of $8.0 million, as compared with net other income of $20.2 million in 2008, primarily due to a $13.5 million increase in net losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites functional currencies, an $11.0 million decrease in net gains on forward exchange contracts (primarily the Euro and British pound) and a $2.8 million gain in 2008 on the bargain purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Niigata, as discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, that did not recur. Tax Expense and Tax Rate 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 141.6 $ 156.5 $ 147.7 Effective tax rate 26.7 % 26.8 % 24.9 % The 2010 and 2009 effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which included the impacts of lower foreign tax rates and changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions. The 2008 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which included the impacts of lower foreign tax rates, changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions, benefits arising from our permanent reinvestment in foreign subsidiaries, changes in valuation allowance estimates and a favorable tax ruling in Luxembourg. The net impact of discrete items included in the discussion above was approximately $22 million, which lowered the effective tax rate by approximately 3.7%. We have operations in certain Asian countries that provide various tax incentives. During 2004, we received a 5-year, 10% tax rate in Singapore for income in excess of a prescribed base amount generated from certain regional headquarter activities, subject to certain employment and investment requirements. In 2008, the 10% tax rate in Singapore was extended through 2011. In India, we were granted 100% tax exemptions for profits derived from export sales and certain manufacturing operations in prescribed areas for a period of 10 years. The exemption for profits derived from export sales will expire in 2011, and the manufacturing operations exemption expired in 2007. On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was signed into law, creating an exclusion from U.S. taxable income for certain types of foreign related party payments of dividends, interest, rents and royalties that, prior to 2006, had been subject to U.S. taxation. This exclusion is effective for the years 2006 through 2011, and applies to certain of our related party payments. Our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location. Changes in any of these and other factors, including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits, could impact the tax rate in future periods. As of December 31, 2010 we have foreign tax credits of $29.5 million, expiring in 2018 through 2020 against which we recorded no valuation allowances. Additionally, we have recorded other U.S. net deferred tax assets of $47.9 million, which relate to net operating losses, tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods, most of which do not have a definite expiration. Should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses, our effective tax rate would increase. 40 Table of Contents Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation $ 388.3 $ 427.9 $ 442.4 Net earnings per share diluted 6.88 7.59 7.71 Average diluted shares 56.4 56.4 57.4 Net earnings in 2010 decreased by $39.6 million to $388.3 million, or $6.88 per diluted share, as compared with 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to $48.1 million decrease in operating income and a $10.3 million increase in other (expense) income, net, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in interest expense, as discussed above, and a $14.9 million decrease in tax expense. Net earnings in 2009 decreased by $14.5 million to $427.9 million, or $7.59 per diluted share, as compared with 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $28.2 million increase in other (expense) income, net and an $8.8 million increase in tax expense, partially offset by the $13.8 million increase in operating income and an $11.3 million decrease in interest expense, as discussed above. Other Comprehensive (Expense) Income 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Other comprehensive (expense) income $ (1.4 ) $ 63.0 $ (190.8 ) Other comprehensive (expense) income in 2010 decreased by $64.4 million to expense of $1.4 million, primarily reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro at December 31, 2010 as compared with December 31, 2009, partially offset by a further decrease in pension and other postretirement expense in 2010. Other comprehensive (expense) income in 2009 increased by $253.8 million to income of $63.0 million as compared with 2008. The increase was due primarily to the weakening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro at December 31, 2009 as compared with December 31, 2008, as well as a decrease in pension and other postretirement expense, due primarily to events in 2008 that did not recur and an increase in interest rate hedging activity. Business Segments We conduct our operations through three business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment operating income. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our segments. The key operating results for our three business segments, EPD, IPD and FCD, are discussed below. FSG Engineered Product Division Segment Results Our largest business segment is EPD, through which we design, manufacture, distribute and service engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and provide related services (collectively referred to as original equipment ). EPD includes longer lead-time, highly engineered pump products and mechanical seals. EPD also manufactures replacement parts and related equipment and provides a full array of replacement parts, repair and support services (collectively referred to as aftermarket ). EPD primarily operates in the oil and gas, petrochemical and power generation industries. EPD operates in 39 countries with 26 manufacturing facilities 41 Table of Contents worldwide, nine of which are located in Europe, nine in North America, four in Asia and four in Latin America, and it has 117 service centers, including those co-located in manufacturing facilities. EPD 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 2,242.0 $ 1,976.0 $ 2,623.5 Sales 2,152.7 2,316.3 2,252.2 Gross profit 782.9 843.5 811.8 Gross profit margin 36.4 % 36.4 % 36.0 % Segment operating income 412.6 434.8 401.8 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 19.2 % 18.8 % 17.8 % Backlog (at period end) 1,435.5 1,382.1 1,725.8 Bookings in 2010 increased by $266.0 million, or 13.5%, as compared with 2009. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $13 million. The increase in bookings reflects higher demand for our products in the oil and gas and general industries across all regions, including the impact of an order in excess of $80 million for crude oil pumps, seals and related support services received in the second quarter of 2010. Customer bookings increased $114.9 million (including currency benefits of approximately $13 million) in Latin America, $78.2 million in North America (including currency benefits of approximately $8 million), $63.4 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $26 million) in EMA and $23.8 million (including currency benefits of approximately $18 million) in Asia Pacific. These increases were attributable to original equipment and aftermarket bookings on major projects in the oil and gas, general, mining, power generation and chemical industries, partially offset by decreased bookings in the water management industry and decreased aftermarket bookings in EMA. Of the $2.2 billion of bookings in 2010, approximately 54% were from oil and gas, 19% from power generation, 12% from chemical, 1% from water management and 14% from general industries. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) increased $12.4 million. Bookings in 2009 decreased by $647.5 million, or 24.7%, as compared with 2008. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $113 million. The decrease in bookings reflects lower demand and customer-driven large project delays due to a significant decrease in the rate of general global economic growth as compared with 2008. The decrease consisted of declines in original equipment bookings on major projects, which were driven by declines in the oil and gas, general, mining and water management industries, and included the impact of the $85 million order to supply a variety of pumps to build the Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline, which was booked in 2008 and did not recur. Customer bookings decreased $282.0 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $61 million) in EMA, $249.0 million in North America and $127.4 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $41 million) Latin America. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) increased $25.4 million. Of the $2.0 billion of bookings in 2009, approximately 49% were from oil and gas, 22% from power generation, 13% from chemical, 4% water management and 12% from general industries. Sales in 2010 decreased $163.6 million, or 7.1%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $4 million. Customer sales decreased in EMA by $131.3 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $43 million) and North America by $79.8 million (including currency benefits of approximately $8 million), primarily driven by original equipment sales. These decreases were partially offset by increases of customer sales in Latin America of $32.5 million (including currency benefits of $14 million) and Asia Pacific of $10.2 million (including currency benefits of approximately $17 million), primarily driven by increased aftermarket sales. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $1.4 million. Sales in 2009 increased by $64.1 million, or 2.9%, as compared with 2008. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $102 million. The increase was driven by shipments of original equipment large project orders that were booked in 2008 when the oil and gas and power generation industries were stronger and prices were more favorable, which contributed to the increase in original equipment sales in 2009 as compared with 2008. Customer sales increased $82.8 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $58 million) in 42 Table of Contents EMA, $28.4 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $2 million) in Asia Pacific and $3.7 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $39 million) in Latin America. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in North America of $53.3 million, which was attributable to a decline in aftermarket customer sales, primarily in the chemical and general industries. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $0.3 million. Gross profit in 2010 decreased by $60.6 million, or 7.2%, as compared with 2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 of 36.4% was comparable with the same period in 2009. Gross profit margin was negatively impacted by less favorable pricing from beginning of year backlog as compared with 2009 and the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. The decrease in gross profit margin was mostly offset by a sales mix shift towards higher margin aftermarket sales, increased savings realized and decreased charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, as well as operational efficiencies and savings realized from our supply chain initiatives. Gross profit in 2009 increased by $31.7 million, or 3.9%, as compared with 2008. The increase included the effect of $24.3 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Gross profit margin in 2009 of 36.4% increased from 36.0% in 2008. Increases provided by improved pricing on original equipment orders shipped in 2009 that were booked in late 2007 and early 2008, supply chain initiatives, operating efficiency improvements and savings realized from our Realignment Programs were partially offset by a sales mix shift toward original equipment. Original equipment generally carries a lower margin than aftermarket. Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by an increase in sales in 2009 of specialty pumps, which have a higher margin, as compared with 2008. Operating income in 2010 decreased by $22.2 million, or 5.1%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of less than $1 million. The overall net decrease was due primarily to reduced gross profit of $60.6 million, as discussed above, partially offset by decreased SG&A of $36.0 million, which was due to increased savings realized and a decrease in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, decreased selling and marketing-related expenses and strict cost control actions in 2010. Additionally, the $4.4 million benefit from the adjustment of contingent consideration in 2009 related to the acquisition of Calder, discussed below, did not recur. Operating income in 2009 increased by $33.0 million, or 8.2%, as compared with 2008. Operating income included the effect of $42.4 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. The overall net increase included negative currency effects of approximately $31 million. The increase was due primarily to increased gross profit of $31.7 million, which included the effect of savings realized from our Realignment Programs, as discussed above, partially offset by an increase in SG&A. The increase in SG&A was attributable to charges resulting from our Realignment Programs, partially offset by strict cost control actions, a $4.4 million benefit from the adjustment of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Calder (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report) and savings realized from our Realignment Programs. Backlog of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010 increased by $53.4 million, or 3.9%, as compared to December 31, 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $14 million. The overall net increase included the impact of cancellations of $9.8 million of orders booked during the prior years. Backlog of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010 included $25.5 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009 decreased by $343.7 million, or 19.9%, as compared to December 31, 2008. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $48 million. Backlog at December 31, 2009 includes $29.9 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). The overall net decrease included the impact of cancellations of $36.4 million of orders booked in prior years. The acquisition of Calder in April 2009 resulted in a $6.2 million increase in backlog. FSG Industrial Product Division Segment Results Through IPD we design, manufacture, distribute and service pre-configured pumps and pump systems, including submersible motors (collectively referred to as original equipment ). Additionally, IPD manufactures 43 Table of Contents replacement parts and related equipment, and provides a full array of support services (collectively referred to as aftermarket ). IPD includes standardized, general purpose pump products and primarily operates in the oil and gas, chemical, water management, power generation and general industries. IPD operates 13 manufacturing facilities, three of which are located in the U.S and six in Europe, and it operates 21 QRCs worldwide, including 11 sites in Europe and four in the U.S., including those co-located in manufacturing facilities. IPD 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 827.5 $ 823.1 $ 1,140.9 Sales 800.2 971.0 956.7 Gross profit 204.7 262.5 275.0 Gross profit margin 25.6 % 27.0 % 28.7 % Segment operating income 68.5 107.9 117.1 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 8.6 % 11.1 % 12.2 % Backlog (at period end) 568.0 555.6 679.3 Bookings in 2010 increased by $4.4 million, or 0.5%, as compared with 2009. The increase includes negative currency effects of approximately $11 million. The overall net increase was primarily driven by an increase in customer bookings of $57.1 million in the Americas and an increase in interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) of $20.2 million, mostly offset by decreased customer bookings of $74.3 million in EMA and Australia. The overall net decrease in customer bookings was primarily driven by decreased orders of original equipment in the power generation, mining and chemical industries, partially offset by increased customer bookings in the oil and gas markets, primarily in Europe. Of the $827.5 million of bookings in 2010, approximately 31% were from oil and gas, 21% from water management, 10% from chemical, 9% from power generation and 29% from general industries. Bookings in 2009 decreased by $317.8 million, or 27.9%, as compared with 2008. This decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $50 million. The decrease in bookings reflects lower demand due to a significant decrease in the rate of general global economic growth as compared with 2008. The $310.7 million decrease in customer bookings was due to decreases in both original equipment and aftermarket customer bookings, driven by the oil and gas, chemical, water management and general industries and included the impact of $110.9 million in thruster orders that were recorded in the same period in 2008 that did not recur. The decrease was driven by declines in customer bookings of $236.6 million in EMA and Australia and $77.1 million in the Americas. A decrease in interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) accounted for the remaining decrease of $7.1 million. Of the $823.1 million of customer bookings in 2009, approximately 29% were from oil and gas, 20% from water management, 14% from power generation, 11% from chemical and 26% from general industries. Sales in 2010 decreased by $170.8 million, or 17.6%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $9 million. The decreases in customer sales was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of $133.0 million in EMA and Australia and $30.5 million in the Americas. The declines, primarily in the power generation, mining and chemical industries, were attributable to lower backlog as compared with 2009 and included the impact of thruster sales for orders booked in 2008 that did not recur in 2010. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $6.3 million. Sales in 2009 increased by $14.3 million, or 1.5%, as compared with 2008. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $48 million. The overall net increase was driven by an increase of customer sales of original equipment in EMA and Australia, and an increase of $8.3 million in interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above). These decreases were partially offset by decreased original equipment and aftermarket customer sales in the Americas. Gross profit in 2010 decreased by $57.8 million, or 22.0%, as compared with 2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 of 25.6% decreased from 27.0% in 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and less favorable pricing from backlog as compared 44 Table of Contents with 2009, partially offset by a sales mix shift toward more profitable aftermarket sales and increased savings realized and lower charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with the same period in 2009. Gross profit in 2009 decreased by $12.5 million, or 4.6%, as compared with 2008. The decrease included the effect of $9.0 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Gross profit margin in 2009 of 27.0% decreased from 28.7% in 2008. Charges related to our Realignment Programs and a sales mix shift toward less profitable original equipment sales were partially offset by savings realized from our Realignment Programs, strict cost control actions and increased utilization of low-cost regions. Operating income for 2010 decreased by $39.4 million, or 36.5%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $3 million. The decrease is due to the $57.8 million decrease in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by an $18.4 million decrease in SG&A. The decrease in SG&A is due to decreased selling-related expenses, strict cost control actions in 2010 and increased savings realized and lower charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009. Operating income in 2009 decreased by $9.2 million, or 7.9%, as compared with 2008. The decrease included the effect of $11.3 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $7 million. The decrease is due to the $12.5 million decrease in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in SG&A. The decrease in SG&A was due to strict cost control actions in 2009 and savings realized from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Backlog of $568.0 million at December 31, 2010 increased by $12.4 million, or 2.2%, as compared to December 31, 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $24 million. Backlog at December 31, 2010 included $38.5 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $555.6 million at December 31, 2009 decreased by $123.7 million, or 18.2%, as compared to December 31, 2008. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $30 million. Backlog at December 31, 2009 included $19.8 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Flow Control Division Segment Results Our second largest business segment is FCD, which designs, manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of engineered-to-order and configured-to-order isolation valves, control valves, valve automation products, boiler controls and related services. FCD leverages its experience and application know-how by offering a complete menu of engineered services to complement its expansive product portfolio. FCD has a total of 54 manufacturing facilities and QRCs in 23 countries around the world, with only five of its 25 manufacturing operations located in the U.S. Based on independent industry sources, we believe that we are the fourth largest industrial valve supplier on a global basis. FCD 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 1,306.6 $ 1,198.3 $ 1,486.4 Sales 1,197.5 1,203.2 1,381.7 Gross profit 422.3 445.2 497.7 Gross profit margin 35.3 % 37.0 % 36.0 % Segment operating income 180.4 204.1 218.7 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 15.1 % 17.0 % 15.8 % Backlog (at period end) 658.5 485.3 482.9 As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we acquired for inclusion in FCD, Valbart, a privately-owned Italian valve manufacturer, effective July 16, 2010. Valbart results of operations have been consolidated since the date of acquisition and are included in FCD segment results of operations above. No pro forma information has been provided for the acquisition due to immateriality. The impact of the acquisition of Valbart on FCD results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 includes bookings of $54.6 million, sales of $38.3 million, gross profit (loss) of $(0.9) million, 45 Table of Contents operating loss of $12.4 million (including acquisition-related costs of $2.7 million) and period end backlog of $94.8 million. The gross profit (loss) margin of (2.3%) and operating loss primarily resulted from the negative impact of low margins on acquired backlog, acquisition-related costs, certain integration costs and amortization of assets acquired at fair value ( Purchase Accounting Adjustments ). We do not expect these losses to continue as we work to fully integrate Valbart operations. Bookings in 2010 increased $108.3 million, or 9.0% as compared with 2009. The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $14 million. The overall net increase in bookings was attributable to bookings provided by Valbart of $54.6 million, strength in the oil and gas industry, primarily in EMA and North America, increased bookings in general industries, driven by growth in the district heating market in Russia, and growing aftermarket repair and replacement orders. Inventory restocking orders from distributors were a key driver in the North American market recovery. Increased bookings were partially offset by decreases in the power generation industry, driven by orders of more than $45 million to supply valves to four Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear power units booked in the same period in 2009 that did not recur, and customer-driven large project delays in the chemical and oil and gas industries. Of the $1.3 billion of bookings in 2010, approximately 27% were from oil and gas, 27% from chemical, 26% from general industries 18% from power generation and 2% from water management. Bookings in 2009 decreased by $288.1 million, or 19.4%, as compared with 2008. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $53 million. The decrease in bookings was primarily attributable to Europe and North America, which decreased approximately $135 million and $70 million, respectively, driven by an overall decrease in orders from distributors and the chemical industry, as well as customer-driven delays in large projects in the oil and gas market. The decline in orders from distributors in Europe was driven by a decrease in general industries due to uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions. The decline in orders from distributors in North America was due to inventory destocking. The chemical industry represented the largest global market decline, especially in Europe and North America, while oil and gas bookings declined due to customer-driven large project delays. Bookings in Asia Pacific decreased approximately $40 million, attributable to customer-driven delays on large projects in the chemical industry, and bookings in Latin America decreased approximately $26 million due to large pulp and paper projects in the first quarter of 2008 that did not recur. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in nuclear power orders, which included orders recorded in the third quarter of 2009 of more than $45 million to supply valves to four Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear power units in North America, new project bookings in the emerging solar market, reflecting future growth opportunities, growth in the Middle East through expansion of QRC and joint venture activities and increased aftermarket repair and replacement orders. Of the $1.2 billion of bookings in 2009, approximately 29% were from chemical, 28% from general industries, 23% from power generation and 20% from oil and gas. Sales in 2010 decreased $5.7 million, or 0.5%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $19 million. A decrease in sales in EMA of approximately $27 million, which included the impact of sales provided by Valbart of $38.3 million, was primarily driven by a decline in sales in the chemical industry, as well as customer-driven delays in large projects in the oil and gas industry. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of approximately $17 million in Asia Pacific, primarily driven by the nuclear and fossil power markets in China. Sales in 2009 decreased by $178.5 million, or 12.9%, as compared with 2008. This decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $56 million. Sales in Europe and North America decreased approximately $91 million and $56 million, respectively, driven by an overall decline in sales to distributors and the chemical industry, as well as customer-driven delays in large projects in the oil and gas industry. During 2009, the drivers of the decline in sales were consistent with the drivers of the decline in bookings discussed above. Gross profit in 2010 decreased by $22.9 million, or 5.1% as compared with 2009. Gross profit margin in 2010 of 35.3% decreased from 37.0% for the same period in 2009. The decrease is primarily attributable to the negative impact of low margins on acquired Valbart backlog, as well as decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix and increased savings realized and decreased charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, as well as various CIP initiatives and improved utilization of low-cost regions. 46 Table of Contents Gross profit in 2009 decreased by $52.5 million, or 10.5%, as compared with 2008. The decrease included the effect of $7.5 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Gross profit margin in 2009 of 37.0% increased from 36.0% for 2008. The increase in gross profit margin was attributable to improved pricing on large projects booked in 2008 that shipped in 2009, increased aftermarket repair and replacement business, materials cost savings, various CIP initiatives, improved utilization of low-cost regions, volume-related cost control actions and savings realized from our Realignment Programs. These improvements were partially offset by pricing pressure and the negative impact of decreased sales on absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Operating income in 2010 decreased by $23.7 million, or 11.6%, as compared with 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $1 million. The decrease was principally attributable to the $22.9 million decrease in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in SG&A. Decreased SG&A is attributable to decreased selling and marketing-related expenses and increased savings realized and decreased charges resulting from our Realignment Programs as compared with 2009, partially offset by $5.0 million in bad debt recoveries from the same period in 2009 that did not recur and $2.7 million in Valbart acquisition-related costs. Valbart provided a net operating loss of $12.4 million, including the impact of acquisition-related costs. Operating income in 2009 decreased by $14.6 million, or 6.7% as compared with 2008. The decrease included the effect of $11.5 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $10 million. The decrease was attributable to the $52.5 million decrease in gross profit, which included the effect of savings realized from our Realignment Program, partially offset by a $41.2 million decrease in SG&A. Reduced SG&A was attributable to decreased selling and marketing-related expenses, strict cost control actions, $5.0 million in cash recoveries of bad debts reserved in 2008 and savings realized from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Backlog of $658.5 million at December 31, 2010 increased by $173.2 million, or 35.7% as compared to December 31, 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $13 million. The overall net increase included backlog related to the acquisition of Valbart of $94.8 million. Backlog of $485.3 million at December 31, 2009 was comparable to December 31, 2008. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $9 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Analysis 2010 2009 2008 (Amounts in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 355.8 $ 431.3 $ 408.8 Net cash flows used by investing activities (286.7 ) (138.6 ) (119.6 ) Net cash flows used by financing activities (142.9 ) (107.1 ) (185.5 ) Existing cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving line of credit are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2010 was $557.6 million, compared with $654.3 million at December 31, 2009 and $472.1 million at December 31, 2008. Working capital increased in 2010 due primarily to lower accrued liabilities of $125.6 million resulting primarily from reductions in accruals for long-term and broad-based annual incentive program payments, higher inventory of $52.9 million and higher accounts receivable of $52.0 million, partially offset by higher accounts payable of $70.7 million. During 2010, we contributed $33.4 million to our U.S. pension plan. Working capital increased in 2009 due primarily to lower accrued liabilities of $106.8 million resulting primarily from reductions in accruals for long-term and broad-based annual incentive program payments and reductions in advanced cash received from customers and lower accounts payable of $104.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by lower inventory of $74.7 million and lower accounts receivable of $50.7 million. During 2009, we contributed $83.1 million to our U.S. pension plan. 47 Table of Contents Our goal for days sales receivables outstanding ( DSO ) is 60 days. For the fourth quarter of 2010, our DSO was 66 days as compared with 59 days and 62 days for the same periods in 2009 and 2008, respectively. For reference purposes based on 2010 sales, a DSO improvement of one day could provide approximately $13 million in cash. An increase in inventory used $52.9 million of cash flow for 2010 compared with providing cash of $74.7 million in 2009 and using cash of $195.5 million in 2008. Inventory turns were 3.4 times at December 31, 2010, compared with 4.0 times at December 31, 2009 and 3.6 times at December 31, 2008. For reference purposes based on 2010 data, an improvement of one turn could yield approximately $201 million in cash. Cash outflows for investing activities were $286.7 million, $138.6 million and $119.6 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, due primarily to capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. Cash outflows for 2010 also included $199.4 million for the acquisition of Valbart, as discussed below in Payments for Acquisitions. Capital expenditures during 2010 were $102.0 million, a decrease of $6.4 million as compared with 2009. Our capital expenditures have been focused on capacity expansion, including expansion of our QRC network, nuclear capabilities and low-cost sourcing; enterprise resource planning application upgrades; information technology infrastructure; and cost reduction opportunities. Cash outflows for financing activities were $142.9 million in 2010 compared with $107.1 million in 2009 and $185.5 million in 2008. Cash outflows during 2010 resulted primarily from the payment of $63.6 million in dividends, $46.0 million for the repurchase of common shares and approximately $40 million to liquidate debt in completing a new credit agreement in December 2010 (discussed below under Credit Facilities ). Cash outflows during 2009 resulted primarily from the payment of $59.2 million in dividends and $40.9 million for the repurchase of common shares. On February 22, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock from $0.27 per share to $0.29 per share payable quarterly beginning on April 7, 2010. On February 21, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock from $0.29 per share to $0.32 per share payable quarterly beginning on April 14, 2011. Generally, our dividend date-of-record is in the last month of the quarter, and the dividend is paid the following month. Any subsequent dividends will be reviewed by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and declared at its discretion dependent on its assessment of our financial situation and business outlook at the applicable time. On February 26, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock, and the program commenced in the second quarter of 2008. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and we reserve the right to limit or terminate the repurchase program at any time without notice. We repurchased 450,000, 544,500 and 1,741,100 shares for $46.0 million, $40.9 million and $165.0 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. To date, we have repurchased a total of 2,735,600 shares for $251.9 million under this program. Our cash needs for the next 12 months are expected to be in line with 2010, resulting from an expected decrease in pension contributions, a small decrease in incentive compensation payments, along with a small anticipated increase in capital expenditures and an increase in cash dividends. We believe cash flows from operating activities, combined with availability under our revolving line of credit and our existing cash balances, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by the decrease in the rate of general global economic growth, as well as economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for periods beyond the next 12 months. Payments for Acquisitions We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise economical capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. 48 Table of Contents As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, effective July 16, 2010, we acquired for inclusion in FCD, 100% of Valbart, a privately-owned Italian valve manufacturer, in a share purchase for cash of $199.4 million, which included $33.8 million of existing Valbart net debt (defined as Valbart third party debt less cash on hand) that was repaid at closing. Valbart manufactures trunnion-mounted ball valves used primarily in upstream and midstream oil and gas applications, which enables us to offer a more complete valve product portfolio to our oil and gas project customers. The acquisition included Valbart portion of the joint venture with us that we entered into in December 2009 that was not operational during 2010. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we deposited $5.8 million into escrow to be held and applied against any breach of representations, warranties or indemnities for 30 months. At the expiration of the escrow period, any residual amounts will be released to the sellers in satisfaction of the purchase price. Effective April 21, 2009, we acquired for inclusion in EPD, Calder, a private Swiss company and a supplier of energy recovery technology for use in the global desalination market, for $30.8 million, net of cash acquired. Of the total purchase price, $28.4 million was paid at closing and $2.4 million was paid after the working capital valuation was completed in early July 2009. During 2008, we acquired for inclusion in EPD the remaining 50% interest in Niigata, effective March 1, 2008, for $2.4 million in cash. Financing Debt, including capital lease obligations, consisted of: December 31, 2010 2009 (Amounts in thousands) New Term Loan, interest rate of 2.30% at December 31, 2010 $ 500,000 $ Old Term Loan, interest rate of 1.81% at December 31, 2009 544,016 Capital lease obligations and other borrowings 27,711 22,712 Debt and capital lease obligations 527,711 566,728 Less amounts due within one year 51,481 27,355 Total debt due after one year $ 476,230 $ 539,373 Credit Facilities On December 14, 2010 (the Closing Date ), we entered into a new credit agreement ( Credit Agreement ) with Bank of America, N.A., as swingline lender, letter of credit issuer and administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (together, the Lenders ), for term debt ( New Term Loan ) and a revolving credit facility ( New Revolving Credit Facility ). The Credit Agreement provides for an aggregate commitment of $1.0 billion, including a $500.0 million New Term Loan facility with a maturity date of December 14, 2015 and a $500.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility with a maturity date of December 14, 2015 (collectively referred to as New Credit Facilities ). The New Revolving Credit Facility includes a $300.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the amount of the New Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $200.0 million. We used all of the proceeds advanced under the New Term Loan, along with approximately $40 million of cash on hand, to repay all outstanding indebtedness under our then-existing credit agreement dated as of August 12, 2005, as amended, which included a $600.0 million term loan ( Old Term Loan ) and a $400.0 million revolving line of credit (collectively referred to as the Old Credit Agreement ). In connection with this repayment, our outstanding letters of credit under the Old Credit Agreement were transferred to the New Revolving Credit Facility, and we terminated the Old Credit Agreement on the Closing Date. The proceeds of the Credit Agreement will be used to fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs. Future draws under the New Revolving Credit Facility are subject to various conditions, including the existence of no default under the Credit Agreement. We incurred $11.6 million in fees related to the Credit Agreement. Prior to the refinancing, we had $2.7 million of unamortized deferred loan costs related to the Old Credit Agreement. Based upon the syndicate of financial institutions for the Credit Agreement, we expensed $1.5 million of these unamortized deferred loan costs and 49 Table of Contents $0.1 million in fees related to the Credit Agreement in other (expense) income, net in 2010. The remaining $11.5 million of fees related to the Credit Agreement were capitalized, along with the remaining $1.2 million of previously unamortized deferred loan costs, for a total of $12.7 million in deferred loan costs included in other assets, net. These costs are being amortized over the term of the Credit Agreement and are recorded in interest expense. At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility or the revolving line of credit under the Old Credit Agreement, as applicable. We had outstanding letters of credit of $133.9 million and $123.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which reduced our borrowing capacity to $366.1 million and $276.9 million, respectively. Borrowings under our New Credit Facilities, other than in respect of swingline loans, bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 1.75% 2.50%, as applicable, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (2) the base rate (which is based on greater of the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under our New Credit Facilities or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, or (3) a daily rate equal to the one month LIBOR plus 1.0% plus, as applicable, an applicable margin of 0.75% 1.50% determined by reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ). The applicable interest rate as of December 31, 2010 was 2.3% for borrowings under our New Credit Facilities. In connection with our New Credit Facilities, we have entered into $350.0 million of notional amount of interest rate swaps at December 31, 2010 to hedge exposure to floating interest rates. We pay the Lenders under the New Credit Facilities a commitment fee equal to a percentage ranging from 0.30% to 0.50%, determined by reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of the unutilized portion of the New Revolving Credit Facility, and letter of credit fees with respect to each standby letter of credit outstanding under our New Credit Facilities equal to a percentage based on the applicable margin in effect for LIBOR borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility. The fees for financial and performance standby letters of credit are 2.0% and 1.0%, respectively. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by substantially all of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain controlled company and materiality exceptions. The Lenders have agreed to release the collateral if we achieve an Investment Grade Rating (as defined in the Credit Agreement) by both Moody Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Ratings Services for our senior unsecured, non-credit-enhanced, long-term debt (in each case, with an outlook of stable or better), with the understanding that identical collateral will be required to be pledged to the Lenders anytime following a release of the collateral that an Investment Grade Rating is not maintained. In addition, prior to our obtaining and maintaining investment grade credit ratings, our and the guarantors obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our and the guarantors assets. We have not achieved these ratings as of December 31, 2010. European Letter of Credit Facilities On October 30, 2009, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured European Letter of Credit Facility ( New European LOC Facility ) with an initial commitment of 125.0 million. The New European LOC Facility is renewable annually and, consistent with the Old European LOC Facility, is used for contingent obligations in respect of surety and performance bonds, bank guarantees and similar obligations with maturities up to five years. We renewed the New European LOC Facility in October 2010 consistent with its terms for an additional 364-day period. We pay fees of 1.35% and 0.40% for utilized and unutilized capacity, respectively, under our New European LOC Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit drawn on the New European LOC Facility of 55.7 million ($74.5 million) and 2.8 million ($4.0 million) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our ability to issue additional letters of credit under our previous European Letter of Credit Facility ( Old European LOC Facility ), which had a commitment of 110.0 million, expired November 9, 2009. We paid annual and fronting fees of 0.875% and 0.10%, respectively, for letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility of 33.3 million ($44.5 million) and 77.9 million ($111.5 million) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 50 Table of Contents Certain banks are parties to both facilities and are managing their exposures on an aggregated basis. As such, the commitment under the New European LOC Facility is reduced by the face amount of existing letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility prior to its expiration. These existing letters of credit will remain outstanding, and accordingly offset the 125.0 million capacity of the New European LOC Facility until their maturity, which, as of December 31, 2010, was approximately two years for the majority of the outstanding existing letters of credit. After consideration of outstanding commitments under both facilities, the available capacity under the New European LOC Facility was 102.3 million as of December 31, 2010, of which 55.7 million has been drawn. Debt Prepayments and Repayments We made scheduled repayments under our Old Credit Agreement of $4.3 million, $5.7 million and $5.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We made no mandatory repayments or optional prepayments in 2010, 2009 or 2008, with the exception of the proceeds advanced under the New Term Loan Facility, along with approximately $40 million of cash on hand to repay all outstanding indebtedness under our Old Credit Agreement. We may prepay loans under our New Credit Facilities in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time. Debt Covenants and Other Matters Our New Credit Facilities contain, among other things, covenants restricting our and our subsidiaries ability to dispose of assets, merge, pay dividends, repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness, incur indebtedness and guarantees, create liens, enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses, make certain investments or acquisitions, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into transactions with affiliates, make capital expenditures, or engage in any business activity other than our existing business. Our New Credit Facilities also contain covenants requiring us to deliver to lenders our audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements and leverage and interest coverage financial covenant certificates of compliance. The maximum permitted leverage ratio is 3.25 times total debt to consolidated EBITDA. The minimum interest coverage is 3.25 times consolidated EBITDA to total interest expense. Compliance with these financial covenants under our New Credit Facilities is tested quarterly. Our New Credit Facilities include events of default customary for these types of credit facilities, including nonpayment of principal or interest, violation of covenants, incorrectness of representations and warranties, cross defaults and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material judgments, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ), events, actual or asserted invalidity of the guarantees or the security documents and certain changes of control of our company. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the acceleration of our and the guarantors obligations under the New Credit Facilities. We complied with all covenants under our New Credit Facilities through December 31, 2010. Our European letter of credit facilities contain covenants restricting the ability of certain foreign subsidiaries to issue debt, incur liens, sell assets, merge, consolidate, make certain investments, pay dividends, enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses or engage in any business activity other than our existing business. The European letter of credit facilities also incorporate by reference the covenants contained in our New Credit Facilities. Our European letter of credit facilities include events of default usual for these types of letter of credit facilities, including nonpayment of any fee or obligation, violation of covenants, incorrectness of representations and warranties, cross defaults and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material judgments, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of the guarantees and certain changes of control of our company. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the termination of the commitments and an acceleration of our obligations under the European letter of credit facilities. We complied with all covenants under our European letter of credit facilities through December 31, 2010. 51 Table of Contents Liquidity Analysis Our cash balance decreased by $96.7 million to $557.6 million as of December 31, 2010 as compared with December 31, 2009. The cash draw was primarily due to the acquisition of Valbart for $199.4 million in cash during the third quarter of 2010 and planned significant cash uses in 2010, including broad-based annual employee incentive compensation program payments related to prior period performance, $102.0 million in capital expenditures, $63.6 million in dividend payments, $46.0 million of share repurchases, the use of approximately $40 million of cash on hand to repay outstanding indebtedness under our prior credit agreement and the funding of increased working capital requirements. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Approximately 5% of our New Term Loan is due to mature in both 2011 and 2012. As noted above, our New Term Loan and our New Revolving Credit Facility both mature in December 2015. After the effects of $350.0 million of notional interest rate swaps, approximately 68% of our term debt was at fixed rates at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had a borrowing capacity of $366.1 million on our $500.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility (due to outstanding letters of credit), and we had net available capacity under the New European LOC Facility of 46.6 million. Our New Revolving Credit Facility and our New European LOC Facility are committed and are held by a diversified group of financial institutions. In 2010 and 2009, we experienced increases in the values of our U.S. pension plan assets. We experienced significant declines in the values of our U.S. pension plan assets in 2008 resulting primarily from declines in global equity markets. After consideration of the impact of our contributions in 2009, the partial recovery in 2009 and 2010 of asset value declines in 2008 and our intent to become fully-funded, we contributed $33.4 million to our U.S. pension plan in 2010. We continue to maintain an asset allocation consistent with our strategy to maximize total return, while reducing portfolio risks through asset class diversification. We continue to monitor and evaluate the implications of lingering effects of global financial markets and banking systems disruptions experienced in 2008 and 2009 on our current business (including our access to capital), our customers and suppliers and the state of the global economy. While credit and capital markets have stabilized in recent months, additional disruptions or lingering uncertainty in the functioning of these markets could potentially materially impair our and our customers ability to access these markets and further increase associated costs, as well as our customers ability to pay in full and/or on a timely basis. OUTLOOK FOR 2011 Our future results of operations and other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross profit margin and costs, capital spending, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenses, potential impairment of investments, tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount, type and valuation of share-based awards granted, as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Our bookings increased 8.8% in 2010 as compared with 2009, and our backlog at December 31, 2010 increased 9.4% as compared to December 31, 2009, which is expected to drive increased revenue in 2011 as compared with 2010, excluding currency fluctuations. Because a booking represents a contract that can be, in certain circumstances, modified or canceled, and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition, there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in a comparable increase in revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results. While we believe that our primary markets continue to provide opportunities, as evidenced by nine consecutive quarters of approximately $1 billion in bookings and the year-over-year increase in our backlog, we remain cautious in our outlook for 2011 given the continuing uncertainty of global economic conditions. While we have not experienced a disruption to our business resulting from recent developing political and economic conditions in the Middle East, we will continue to closely monitor the 52 Table of Contents conditions. For additional discussion on our markets and our opportunities, see the Business Overview Our Markets section of this MD&A. We expect to experience increased external pressures on gross profit margin in 2011 as compared with 2010 and 2009 due to price competition associated with current global economic conditions. We expect these gross profit margin pressures to be at least partially offset by planned increases in shipments, operational improvements, continuation of our end user strategy, the strength of our aftermarket business, supply chain initiatives, disciplined contract bidding and savings achieved from our Realignment Programs. As part of our previously communicated Realignment Programs, we plan to incur up to $5.0 million in realignment costs in 2011 as a result of these activities. All of our borrowings under our New Credit Facilities carry a floating rate of interest. As of December 31, 2010, we had $350.0 million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. As a result of reducing the volatility, we may not fully benefit from a decrease in interest rates. We expect our interest expense in 2011 will be comparable to 2010. However, because a portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest, the debt is subject to volatility in rates, which could negatively impact interest expense. Our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Annual Report. We expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt payments and pension plan contributions in 2011. We seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory. However, the amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues, backlog, customer acceptance and other factors. In 2011, our cash flows for investing activities will be focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic expansion, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between $120 million and $130 million, before consideration of any potential acquisition activity. We have $25.0 million in scheduled repayments in 2011 under our New Credit Facilities, and we expect to comply with the covenants under our New Credit Facilities in 2011. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for further discussion of our debt covenants. We currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plan will be between $7 million and $10 million, excluding direct benefits paid, in 2011 in order to maintain fully funded status, as defined by the U.S. Pension Protection Act, for 2011. We currently anticipate that our contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $10 million in 2011. 53 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2010: Payments Due By Period Beyond 5 Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Total (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt $ 25.0 $ 75.0 $ 400.0 $ $ 500.0 Fixed interest payments(1) 1.2 (0.6 ) 0.6 Variable interest payments(2) 11.5 21.0 13.8 46.3 Capital lease obligations and other debt 26.5 1.2 27.7 Operating leases 45.2 66.0 31.3 32.4 174.9 Purchase obligations:(3) Inventory 588.1 38.1 3.0 1.4 630.6 Non-inventory 33.6 2.2 0.7 1.2 37.7 Pension and postretirement benefits(4) 49.9 101.6 107.9 290.1 549.5 Total $ 781.0 $ 304.5 $ 556.7 $ 325.1 $ 1,967.3 (1) Fixed interest payments represent net incremental payments under interest rate swap agreements.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS Our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits. In accounting for retirement plans, management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long-term rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, turnover, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the 54 Table of Contents pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding. Plan Descriptions We and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 72% of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately 58% of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the U.S. qualified plan as of December 31, 2010. The assets for the U.S. qualified plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to all of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants compensation and years of credited service. Assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2010, the estimated fair market value of U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans increased to $479.7 million from $427.2 million at December 31, 2009. Assets were allocated as follows: U.S. Plan Asset category 2010 2009 U.S. Large Cap 35 % 39 % U.S. Small Cap 5 % 6 % International Large Cap 10 % 11 % Equity securities 50 % 56 % Long-Term Government/Credit 29 % 11 % Intermediate Bond 21 % 32 % Fixed income 50 % 43 % Multi-strategy hedge fund 0 % 1 % Other(1) 0 % 0 % Other 0 % 1 % Non-U.S. Plans Asset category 2010 2009 North American Companies 5 % 5 % U.K. Companies 26 % 27 % European Companies 7 % 8 % Asian Pacific Companies 6 % 5 % Global Equity 3 % 3 % Emerging Markets(1) 0 % 0 % Equity securities 47 % 48 % U.K. Government Gilt Index 18 % 19 % U.K. Corporate Bond Index 15 % 15 % Global Fixed Income Bond 18 % 15 % Fixed income 51 % 49 % Other 2 % 3 % (1) Less than 1% of holdings are in Other and Emerging Markets. None of our common stock is directly held by these plans. 55 Table of Contents The projected benefit obligation ( Benefit Obligation ) for our defined benefit pension plans was $625.7 million and $606.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2011 is $1.1 million. The estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2011 is $12.7 million. We amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net losses over the remaining expected service period or over the remaining expected lifetime of inactive participants for plans with only inactive participants. We sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. These plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies. We fund the plans as benefits are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. The benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees. The Benefit Obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was $39.1 million and $40.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2011 is $1.6 million. The estimated actuarial net benefit for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2011 is $1.7 million. We amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net gain over the remaining expected service period of approximately four years. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions We account for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. Our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We, in consultation with our actuaries, evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits, such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets for funded plans, mortality rates, retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases, and determine such assumptions as of December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect Benefit Obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. See discussion of our assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the Our Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A. In 2010, net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in income from continuing operations was $36.1 million compared with $35.7 million in 2009 and $29.5 million in 2008. The (gain) expense for the postretirement medical plans was $(2.4) million in 2010 compared with $(2.3) million in 2009 and $1.1 million in 2008. 56 Table of Contents The following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2010: U.S. Plan Non-U.S. Plans Weighted average assumptions used to determine Benefit Obligations: Discount rate 5.00 % 5.13 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.25 3.46 Weighted average assumptions used to determine 2010 net pension expense: Long-term rate of return on assets 7.00 % 6.21 % Discount rate 5.50 5.41 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.80 3.58 The following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the U.S. qualified and aggregate non-U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement plans. Effect of Discount Rate Changes and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.3 ) $ 1.3 Effect on Benefit Obligation (12.9 ) 13.9 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (1.9 ) 2.0 Effect on Benefit Obligation (20.1 ) 21.2 U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense (0.1 ) 0.2 Effect on Benefit Obligation (1.0 ) 1.1 Effect of Changes in the Expected Return on Assets and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.7 ) $ 1.7 Effect on Benefit Obligation N/A N/A Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (0.6 ) 0.6 Effect on Benefit Obligation N/A N/A U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense N/A N/A Effect on Benefit Obligation N/A N/A As discussed below, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. At December 31, 2010, as compared to December 31, 2009, we decreased our discount rate for the U.S. plan from 5.50% to 5.00% based on an analysis of publicly-traded investment grade U.S. corporate bonds, which had a lower yield due to current market conditions. We decreased our average rate for non-U.S. plans from 5.41% to 5.13% based primarily on lower applicable corporate AA-graded bond yields for the U.K. and Euro zone. We decreased our average assumed rate of compensation from 4.80% to 4.25% for the U.S. plan and from 3.58% to 3.46% for our non-U.S. plans. To determine the 2010 pension expense, we decreased the expected rate of return on 57 Table of Contents U.S. plan assets from 7.75% to 7.00% and we increased our average rate of return on non-U.S. plan assets from 4.38% to 6.21%, primarily as a result of the increase in the U.K. rate of return on assets. As the expected rate of return on plan assets is long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. We expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately $2 million higher in 2011 than the $36.1 million in 2010, reflecting, among other things, the increased amortization of the actuarial net loss. We expect the 2011 benefit for the postretirement medical plans to be approximately $1 million lower than the $2.4 million in 2010, primarily reflecting decreased amortization of the actuarial net gain. We have used discount rates of 5.00% and 4.75% at December 31, 2010, in calculating our estimated 2011 cost of pension benefits and cost of other postretirement benefits for U.S. plans, respectively. The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were 9.0% for 2010, 9.0% for 2009 and 7.8% for 2008, with a gradual decrease to 5.0% for 2032 and future years. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care. Plan Funding Our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs. We contributed $50.2 million, $101.2 million and $71.0 million to our defined benefit plans in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. After consideration of the impact of our contributions in 2010, the partial recovery in 2010 and 2009 of asset value declines experienced in 2008 and our intent to remain fully-funded, we currently anticipate that our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2011 will be between $7 million and $10 million, excluding direct benefits paid. We expect to contribute approximately $10 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2011. For further discussions on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. The most significant estimates made by management include: timing and amount of revenue recognition; deferred taxes, tax valuation allowances and tax reserves; reserves for contingent losses; retirement and postretirement benefits; and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management, and management presents its views to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may differ from the estimates, and the difference may be material. Our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers, which is based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions. In addition, our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement, a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectability. For contracts containing multiple 58 Table of Contents elements, each having a determinable fair value, we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the element pro rata share of the contract fair value in accordance with the contractual delivery terms for each element. We defer the recognition of revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and/or services have been performed. Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Revenues for long-term contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost-to-cost basis. Percentage of completion revenue represents less than 9% of our consolidated sales in 2010. Revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered. Revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract. These contracts can range in duration, but generally extend for up to five years. Fixed fee service contracts represent less than 2% of our consolidated sales in 2010. In certain instances, we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts. Failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non-recoverable costs. In instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable, we perform a project profitability analysis accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues, which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project. In such instances, we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In circumstances where the total projected reduced revenues still exceed total projected costs, the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition. Our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies. Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves We recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances, if necessary. We assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could, if successful, result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. 59 Table of Contents Reserves for Contingent Loss Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable. Assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts, including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations. The recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter, changes in political environments, legal venue and other factors. Recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties, technological innovation and regulatory environment changes. Estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos-related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed, settled and dismissed, with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur, and are included in retirement obligations and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. A substantial majority of our asbestos-related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities. Estimated indemnities and receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos-related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries, which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers. Estimated receivables are included in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in claims filed, settled and dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, including former employees, and their beneficiaries. The assets, liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates, rates of compensation increases and other factors. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These assumptions are assessed annually as of December 31 and adjustments are made as needed. We evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained, including appropriate rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation rates. We also compare our significant assumptions with our peers. The methodology to set our assumptions includes: Discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments. For the U.S. the discount rate is obtained from an analysis of publicly-traded investment-grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate. For plans in the United Kingdom and the EURO zone we use the discount rate obtained from an analysis of AA-graded corporate bonds used to generate a yield curve. For other countries or regions without a corporate AA bond market, government bond rates are used. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term high-quality debt securities, as well as the duration of our plans liabilities. Health care cost trend rates are developed based upon historical retiree cost trend data, long-term health care outlook and industry benchmarks. Inflation assumptions are based upon both our specific trends and nationally expected trends. The expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies, expected long-term performance of asset classes, risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. These rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates. Retirement rates are based upon actual and projected plan experience. Mortality rates are based on published actuarial tables relevant to the countries in which we have plans. 60 Table of Contents The expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels, seniority, age and other factors. We evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations, cash flow requirements and other factors, and discuss our funding assumptions with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets The initial recording of goodwill and intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. We test the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. The test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units. In connection with the segment reorganization, we reallocated goodwill to our redefined reporting units and evaluated goodwill for impairment. The identification of the reporting units began at the operating segment level: EPD, IPD and FCD, and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purposes of allocating goodwill and testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions. These conditions included, among other factors, (i) the extent to which a component represents a business and (ii) the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments, which resulted in nine reporting units. Other factors that were considered in determining whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the methods of distribution and the types of industries served. The test of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves significant judgment in estimating projections of future sales levels. Impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. We did not record an impairment of goodwill in 2010, 2009 or 2008. We also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill. Our market capitalization increased in 2010 and did not indicate a potential impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2010. Impairment losses for indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a relief from royalty method, which estimates the fair value of the trademarks by determining the present value of the royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that are consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above. We did not record an impairment of our trademarks in 2010, 2009 or 2008. The net realizable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, is reviewed periodically, when indicators of potential impairments are present, based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing a methodology similar to that for goodwill. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 61 Table of Contents ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS We have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
