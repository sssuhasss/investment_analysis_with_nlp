ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Executive Overview Results in the investment businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the direction of the U.S. equity markets specifically, and more generally to the overall strength of economic conditions. Overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. They may also impact the level of underwriting activity, trading profits and asset valuations. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. Year ended September 30, 2010 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2009 Total Company As a result of the improved markets during the year ended September 30, 2010 as compared to the prior year, our net revenues increased by $371 million, or 15%, to $2.9 billion. Non-interest expenses increased by $251 million, or 11%, to $2.6 billion, primarily from higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in commission revenue compared to the prior year, and partially offset by an $89 million, or 53%, decrease in the bank loan loss provision. We generated net income of $228 million, a 49% increase compared to the prior year. Our financial results during the year were most significantly impacted by: A 23% increase in net revenue in our Private Client Group. This increase results primarily from the improved equity markets combined with realization of the benefits of the strong recruiting results in the previous two years. Net interest earnings decreased $79 million, or 20%, resulting predominately from the lower loan balances and lower interest spreads at RJ Bank, coupled with a full year interest expense on our public debt which was issued in August, 2009. Our Asset Management operating results increased as a result of the increase in assets under management from both asset appreciation and net sales. Investment banking activity in our capital markets segment increased significantly, reflecting an increase in the number of underwritings resulting in a $52 million, or 100%, increase in underwriting fees. As a result of the improved equity market conditions, we also realized significantly increased commissions from institutional clients on equity securities which were partially offset by declines in commissions on fixed income products. Trading profits were strong, although did not reach the record level achieved in the prior year. The RJ Bank pre-tax earnings of $112 million reflect a $32 million, or 40%, improvement as compared to the prior year, the net result of lower net interest income and a significantly lower loan loss provision. Our effective tax rate decreased to 37% from the prior year rate of 38.6%, resulting from tax credits we realized from our ownership interest in certain low-income housing tax credit partnerships, certain state and federal tax credits arising from charitable education contributions, and gains on our company-owned life insurance which are non-taxable. Based on our review of the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act, and because of the nature of our business and our business practices, we do not expect the legislation to have a significant impact on our operations. However, because many of the regulations will result from further studies and are yet to be written by various regulatory agencies, the impact is uncertain. Under the new legislation, as a holding company of RJ Bank, we will become subject to the regulation and oversight of the FRB. We anticipate that this change in our regulator will become effective in mid-2011, to be followed by the conversion of RJ Bank to a commercial bank. At that time we will become a bank holding company. 29 The balance of auction rate securities held by our clients continues to decline and was approximately $600 million at September 30, 2010 as compared to approximately $800 million at September 30, 2009. Refer to the discussion of this matter in Item 3 of this Form 10-K for a more detailed update. The succession plan for our Chief Executive Officer has been successfully implemented effective in May, 2010 and has resulted in an orderly transition of our executive leadership. Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 - Total Company The economic recession in 2009 provided the backdrop for what was an extremely challenging environment in which to operate for the better part of the fiscal year. As a result of the challenging markets, our net revenues decreased by 9% to $2.5 billion, and we generated net income of $153 million, a 35% decline from the prior year. Our financial results were most dramatically impacted by a decrease in revenue from our Private Client Group and Asset Management segments, two of our operations that are highly dependent upon the health of the financial markets. The Fixed Income portion of our Capital Markets segment had a record year by far, while equity underwriting activity was moribund for much of the year. Our bank subsidiary, RJ Bank, was not able to achieve the operating results we had anticipated due to unprecedented problems in t he commercial real estate sector which arose in 2009 and negatively impacted the year provision for loan losses. During the year we opportunistically increased the number of financial advisors, a strategy that positions us well for future growth as the markets improve. In order to fuel additional growth opportunities, we accessed the capital markets for the first time in 23 years through a $300 million, ten year senior note offering. Finally, in 2009 we implemented a succession plan for our Chief Executive Officer that will take effect in May 2010, providing an orderly transition for our executive leadership. 30 Results of Operations - Total Company We currently operate through the following eight business segments: Private Client Group ( PCG ); Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJ Bank; Emerging Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow; Proprietary Capital and certain corporate activities in the Other segment. The following table presents our consolidated and segment gross revenues and pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests for the years indicated : Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 (in 000's) Total Company Revenues $ 2,979,516 $ 2,602,519 $ 3,204,932 Pre-tax Income Excluding Noncontrolling Interests 361,908 248,774 386,854 Private Client Group Revenues 1,903,101 1,557,462 1,999,775 Pre-tax Income 160,470 84,873 178,146 Capital Markets Revenues 591,949 533,254 506,158 Pre-tax Income 84,236 73,481 43,627 Asset Management Revenues 196,817 177,359 243,609 Pre-tax Income 46,981 30,411 61,501 RJ Bank Revenues 276,770 343,366 405,304 Pre-tax Income 112,009 80,011 112,282 Emerging Markets Revenues 16,639 14,891 41,607 Pre-tax Loss (5,446 ) (4,886 ) (3,426 ) Stock Loan/Borrow Revenues 8,837 10,269 36,843 Pre-tax Income 2,721 3,651 7,034 Proprietary Capital Revenues 17,029 12,742 22,869 Pre-tax Income 1,728 1,035 7,361 Other Revenues 8,056 7,153 21,302 Pre-tax Loss (40,791 ) (19,802 ) (19,671 ) Intersegment Eliminations Revenues (39,682 ) (53,977 ) (72,535 ) Pre-tax Income - - - 31 Net Interest Analysis We have certain assets and liabilities that are subject to changes in interest rates; these changes in interest rates have an impact on our overall financial performance. Given the relationship of our interest sensitive assets to liabilities, an increase in short-term interest rates would result in an increase in our net earnings (we currently have more assets than liabilities with a yield that would be affected by a change in short-term interest rates). The amount of benefit would be dependent upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to the change in balances, the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in rates, and the interest rates paid on client cash balances. The following table presents average balance data and interest income and expense data, as well as the related net interest income: Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 Average Balance Interest Inc./Exp.

Year ended September 30, 2010 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2009 Net Interest Net interest income decreased $78.6 million, or 20%, as compared to the prior year. Net interest income is earned primarily by our PCG and RJ Bank segments, which are discussed separately below. In addition, our net interest income was negatively impacted by the $23 million increase in interest expense associated with an entire year of interest expense on our senior notes which were issued in August, 2009. RJ Bank net interest income decreased $62.8 million, or 19%, resulting from a decline in both average interest earning assets and net interest spreads. Refer to the discussion of the specific components of RJ Bank net interest income in the RJ Bank section of this MD&A. 32 Complementing the impact of the implementation of the multi-bank sweep aspect of the RJBDP, which replaced a portion of the foregone interest earnings in the PCG segment with fee income, net interest income in the PCG segment increased $5 million, or 10%, versus the prior year due to higher margin balances and increased net interest spreads on segregated cash. In addition to this increase in net interest income, the PCG segment realized a $32.5 million increase in fee income generated by the multi-bank sweep aspect of the RJBDP during the year. Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 Net Interest Net interest income at RJ Bank increased $106.8 million, or 50%, representing more than all of the $55 million increase in our total net interest earnings. This increase in net interest income at RJ Bank resulted from the significant decline in market rates that occurred early in the fiscal year, leading to lower interest rates being paid on RJ Bank retail deposit accounts throughout the year. RJ Bank benefited as the rates on interest earning assets declined at a much slower pace than rates paid on deposits. The decline in interest rates had a dramatic impact on net interest in the PCG segment, which declined $42 million, or 45%. Interest earned on assets segregated declined $112 million, or 88%, as rates dropped as low as 0.20% for a portion of the year. Average customer margin balances declined $374 million, or 24%, during 2009, contributing to the decline in interest revenue in the PCG segment. Net interest on the stock loan/borrow business decreased 38% due to decreased rates and balances despite a focus on hard-to-locate securities. Other interest revenue includes earnings on corporate cash and other investments. Other interest expense consists of expense on short inventory positions and inventory financing activities. Results of Operations - Private Client Group The following table presents consolidated financial information for our PCG segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2010 % Change 2009 % Change 2008 Revenues: Securities Commissions and Fees $ 1,585,371 26 % $ 1,262,810 (18 %) $ 1,532,290 Interest 63,128 (4 %) 65,589 (72 %) 233,801 Financial Service Fees 146,042 17 % 125,038 (2 %) 127,304 Other 108,560 4 % 104,025 (2 %) 106,380 Total Revenues 1,903,101 22 % 1,557,462 (22 %) 1,999,775 Interest Expense 7,194 (52 %) 14,891 (89 %) 141,474 Net Revenues 1,895,907 23 % 1,542,571 (17 %) 1,858,301 Non-Interest Expenses: Sales Commissions 1,168,055 26 % 929,202 (19 %) 1,144,727 Admin & Incentive Comp and Benefit Costs 310,184 11 % 279,666 (4 %) 289,937 Communications and Information Processing 59,974 2 % 58,607 (2 %) 59,753 Occupancy and Equipment 77,349 (2 %) 79,072 8 % 73,253 Business Development 49,126 (11 %) 55,488 (15 %) 64,992 Clearance and Other 71,263 27 % 55,952 18 % 47,369 Total Non-Interest Expenses 1,735,951 19 % 1,457,987 (13 %) 1,680,031 Income Before Taxes and Including Noncontrolling Interests 159,956 89 % 84,584 (53 %) 178,270 Noncontrolling Interests (514 ) (289 ) 124 Pre-tax Income Excluding Noncontrolling Interests $ 160,470 89 % $ 84,873 (52 %) $ 178,146 Margin on Net Revenues 8.5 % 5.5 % 9.6 % 33 Year ended September 30, 2010 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2009 Private Client Group PCG pre-tax results increased $75.6 million, or 89%, as compared to the prior year on an increase of $353.3 million, or 23%, in net revenues. PCG margins increased to 8.5% of net revenues, a 55% improvement over the prior year. While primarily driven by increased commissions resulting from the realization of the benefits of the strong recruiting results in the previous two years, a combination of market appreciation and an increase in assets under management from new clients also contributed to the strong PCG results. Securities commissions and fees increased $322.5 million, or 26%. Net commissions, after consideration of sales commission expenses, increased $83.7 million, or 25%, as compared to the prior year period. The net commission expense as a percentage of commission revenues was relatively flat year over year. The number of financial advisors as of September 30, 2010 was also relatively flat as compared to September 30, 2009, but up over 10% since the beginning of fiscal 2008. Recruiting of successful financial advisors and improved market conditions drove a 15% increase in average gross production per financial advisor during the past year. PCG results also include the interest revenue and fees earned on client margin balances and cash segregated for regulatory purposes net of the interest expense paid on client cash balances. The $5 million increase in net interest earnings for the current year as compared to the prior year was complemented by a $32.5 million increase in financial service fees from the RJBDP, a multi-bank cash sweep program. The increase in these fees was partially offset by a decline in fees received from the sale of money market funds. Interest results are further discussed in the Net Interest section of this MD&A. Non-interest expenses increased $278 million, or 19%, over the prior year period. Of this increase, 86% (nearly $239 million) was in sales commission expense, a result of the increase in commission revenues. All of the other components of non-interest expense in aggregate increased by 7.4% over the comparable period. The most significant component of this increase resulted from a $15.3 million, or 27% increase in Clearance and Other expenses, also driven by the increase in commission and client activity. We incurred expenses arising from a FINRA arbitration panel decision against RJ&A related to a claim of raiding financial advisors. We settled this matter, the impact of which has been reflected in our fiscal year 2010 results. Partially offsetting the increases, business devel opment expense decreased during fiscal year 2010 due to lower recruiting costs than incurred in the prior year. Recruiting was extremely active during fiscal 2008 and 2009 due to consolidation of, and uncertainties arising within, certain of our broker-dealer competitors. Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 Private Client Group PCG revenues were 22% below the prior year, reflecting the impact of the extremely challenging economic and market conditions. Commission revenue decreased $269 million, or 18%, from the prior year, with the majority of that decrease experienced by our domestic independent contractor operation. Commissions in RJ&A PCG declined only $45 million, or 9%, due to the recruitment of 219 employee financial advisors in fiscal 2009 (for a net increase of 94) and 184 in fiscal 2008 (for a net increase of 114). It generally takes newly recruited financial advisors up to two years to reach their previous production levels. Average production per employee financial advisor decreased to $417,000 in fiscal 2009, down 19% from the $515,000 attained in fiscal 2008. The recruitment of above-average producers did not overcome the negative impact t hat the steep market decline had on our private clients investing activities. RJFS and RJFSA recruited 559 independent contractor financial advisors in fiscal 2009 (for a net increase of 129). Independent contractor financial advisor average production decreased from $330,000 in fiscal 2008 to $273,000 in fiscal 2009, impacted, like RJ&A, by the challenging economic and market conditions. Net interest declined $42 million, or 45%, from the prior year as interest rates declined and spreads narrowed. As rates reached historic lows, earning asset yields continued to fall while there was no room to further lower rates on client deposits, thus compressing the spread earned. Sales commission expense decreased 19%, comparable to the 18% decrease in commission revenue. Total non-interest expenses decreased 13% as a result of our focus on expense control. Administrative expense was tightly controlled despite compensation for additional support personnel, primarily in new branch offices. Business development expense decreased $10 million. These expenses include transition expense, account transfer fees, direct expenses associated with recruiting such as bringing financial advisors to the corporate headquarters, conference expe nses and travel expenses, which we minimized as much as possible given the market environment. Occupancy expense includes the expenses associated with the opening of new branch offices and expansion of others. RJ&A added 16 new offices during fiscal 2009 and 19 during fiscal 2008 and as a result, occupancy expenses increased 8%. 34 Given the 17% decline in net revenues and the 13% decrease in non-interest expense, there was a 52% decline in pre-tax earnings. Overall PCG margins decreased from 9.6% to 5.5%. As over half of the PCG revenues are recurring or asset based in nature, the decline in the equity markets (and therefore in the market values of client assets) had a significant impact on revenue. Financial service fees were also lower as these include transaction fees on certain fee-based accounts. Results of Operations Capital Markets The following table presents consolidated financial information for our Capital Markets segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2010 % Change 2009 % Change 2008 ($ in 000's) Revenues: Institutional Sales Commissions: Equity $ 222,481 12 % $ 198,218 (14 %) $ 229,405 Fixed Income 147,585 (15 %) 174,315 61 % 108,385 Underwriting Fees 104,157 100 % 52,015 (35 %) 80,400 Mergers & Acquisitions Fees 57,783 42 % 40,607 6 % 38,385 Private Placement Fees 1,914 87 % 1,025 (60 %) 2,536 Trading Profits 31,654 (24 %) 41,407 NM (3,503 ) Interest 18,191 34 % 13,608 (59 %) 33,183 Other 8,184 (32 %) 12,059 (31 %) 17,367 Total Revenues 591,949 11 % 533,254 5 % 506,158 Interest Expense 12,814 19 % 10,808 (68 %) 33,337 Net Revenues 579,135 11 % 522,446 10 % 472,821 Non-Interest Expenses: Sales Commissions 128,432 (2 %) 130,463 17 % 111,448 Admin & Incentive Compensation and Benefit Costs 262,791 19 % 220,030 (3 %) 226,052 Communications and Information Processing 37,925 7 % 35,350 (2 %) 35,981 Occupancy and Equipment 19,575 - 19,565 7 % 18,271 Business Development 26,666 19 % 22,500 (4 %) 23,511 Clearance and Other 36,382 (7 %) 39,013 42 % 27,506 Total Non-Interest Expenses 511,771 10 % 466,921 5 % 442,769 Income Before Taxes and Including Noncontrolling Interests 67,364 21 % 55,525 85 % 30,052 Noncontrolling Interests (16,872 ) (17,956 ) (13,575 ) Pre-tax Income Excluding Noncontrolling Interests $ 84,236 15 % $ 73,481 68 % $ 43,627 Year ended September 30, 2010 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2009 Capital Markets Capital Markets pre-tax results increased $10.8 million, or 15%, with net revenues increasing $56.7 million, or 11%, as compared to the prior year. We realized significant increases in underwriting fees of $52.1 million, or 100%, mergers and acquisition fees of $17 million, or 42%, and commissions from institutional equity sales of $24.3 million, or 12%. These increases were offset by a decrease in fixed income sales commissions of $26.7 million, or 15%, and trading profits, which are primarily related to fixed income products and declined in comparison to the prior year by $9.8 million, or 24%. Despite the unfavorable comparison, trading profits were historically strong, although slightly below the record level experienced in the prior year. The number of lead and co-managed underwritings during the y ear were up 76% and 32%, respectively, as compared to the prior year, a time when underwritings were down dramatically due to the then-existing market conditions. The dramatically improved equity market conditions in the current year versus the prior year were conducive to generating the increased equity market commissions, merger and acquisition fees and underwriting fees. Our increased merger and acquisition activity arose primarily from engagements by companies in the Healthcare, Business Services and Energy sectors. Non-interest expenses increased $44.9 million, or 10%, primarily resulting from compensation related costs. The current year includes the addition of investment bankers added in the Lane Berry acquisition, which occurred in the third quarter of the prior year, and increased incentive compensation resulting from the increased profitability in our equity capital markets business. 35 Noncontrolling interests represent the impact of consolidating certain low-income housing tax credit funds and impact Other Revenue, Interest Expense, and Other Expenses in this segment (See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details). Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 Capital Markets Capital Markets net revenues increased 10% compared to the prior year due to record trading profits, which increased $45 million from the prior year $3.5 million loss. These profits were almost entirely generated on domestic fixed income products, 76% on municipal and 37% on taxable products. In addition, fixed income institutional sales commissions were 61% higher, as the volatile fixed income markets led many institutions to seek expertise on mortgage-backed products, and many increased their overall weighting in fixed income products. At the same time, institutions decreased their weighting in equities and equity institutional sales commissions declined 14%. This decline was magnified by a lack of new issue activity. The steep equity market decline early in the year led to lower investment banking fee revenue. Equity underwriting fees were $5.3 million and $10.4 million below the prior year in the U.S. and Canada, respectively. This was attributable to the lack of underwritings due to the declining equity markets during the first two quarters. Capital markets activity increased during the third quarter, with 82% of our deals occurring in the last two quarters of the fiscal year, actually generating nine more deals than in the prior year. However, the deals were smaller and we were generally allotted a smaller portion of the deals than in the prior year, resulting in lower revenues. Merger and acquisition fees, which are included in investment banking revenue, were $40.6 million, up 6% from the prior year. Gross revenues were up 5% from the prior year and net revenues were up 10%. Coupled with a 5% increase in non-interest expense, pre-tax earnings were up 68% from the prior year as the impact of increased trading profits is significant to our pre-tax profits. Commission expense increased with a greater percentage (17%) than commission revenues (10%) due to the big increase in fixed income institutional sales commissions which have a higher payout than equity institutional sales commissions. The other compensation expenses, communications and information processing and business development expenses decreased slightly as a result of expense control. Occupancy expense increased 7% due to growth. We have taken advantage of the opportunities to add quality Capital Markets teams. Equity Capital Markets acquired the investment banking firm of Lane Berry International, Inc. The acquisition added 21 investment banking professionals and new offices in Boston and Denver.

As of September 30, 2010, approximately 85% of investment advisory fees are earned from assets held in managed programs. Approximately 70% of our investment advisory fees recorded in a quarter are determined based on balances at the beginning of a quarter, approximately 15% are based on balances at the end of the quarter and approximately 15% are computed based on average assets. Year ended September 30, 2010 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2009 - Asset Management Asset Management pre-tax results increased $16.6 million, or 54%, and total revenues increased $19.5 million, or 11%, as compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues resulted from a combination of favorable factors including increased market values, additional client investments and $3 million in performance fees. Net assets under management increased by $1.1 billion, or 4%, the net impact of market appreciation and asset flows during the year. We experienced net asset inflows of $2.4 billion into managed accounts from both new clients and clients re-entering the market after the downturn. Non-managed fee-based assets increased $6.8 billion, or 24%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to positive net inflows of approximately $5.4 billion. These revenue increases were partially offset by an $8 million decrease in money market fund fees in the current year ($14 million less in money market management fees net of a $6 million reduction in money market fee waivers). The money market funds were impacted by lower balances and lower interest rates and the resulting spread compression. There were $3 billion in net money market account outflows due to the implementation of the multi-bank sweep aspect of the RJBDP in September, 2009 and the subsequent transfer of the internally managed money market funds to a third-party advisor in August, 2010. Eagle class shares of both a taxable and a tax-exempt money market fund are available to clients of Eagle and its affiliates through the third-party advisor. Increases in compensation costs and investment advisory fee expense were directly correlated to the increase in investment advisory fee revenues. Other expense decreased $8.1 million, or 24%, primarily due to the reduction in costs associated with the money market funds. As money market fund balances decreased, distribution fees paid to the PCG segment declined and there was a reduction in the money market management fee shared with the PCG segment due to the money market fee waivers. 37 Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 - Asset Management Asset Management revenues decreased 27% despite what appears to be only a modest 5% decline in non-money market managed assets. During the year, however, non-money market assets declined 20% and 11% in the December 2008 and March 2009 quarters, respectively. Since a large percentage of the fees are calculated at the beginning of each quarter, this caused significant revenue declines in the March 2009 and June 2009 quarters. The money market funds were significantly impacted by the low interest rates and resulting spread compression. As a result, $27.9 million in fees were waived; $16.9 million that would have been recorded as investment advisory fees in our Asset Management segment and $11 million that would have been recorded as financial service fees in PCG. During September we implemented a multi-bank sweep program to provide FDI C insurance and to improve interest rates for our clients cash deposits. As a result, $2.6 billion was moved from money market funds into other sweep alternatives. Expenses were well controlled, down 19% from the prior year. This did not fully mitigate the decline in revenues and pre-tax income declined 51%. Assets under management however, declined by 12%, or $4.2 billion, during fiscal 2009. Positive net inflows for the year were offset by market depreciation. Despite adverse market conditions, net inflows for the managed programs amounted to approximately $730 million in 2009. Portfolios managed by Eagle experienced approximately $535 million in market depreciation in 2009. Market depreciation within RJCS/Freedom portfolios was approximately $1.2 billion. Money market fund assets decreased as a result of the transfer of approximately $2.6 billion, primarily to the new bank sweep program, in September 2009, contributing to the money market net outflow of $3.1 billion for the year. Non-managed fee-based assets increased 24%, or $5.6 billion, from 2008 due to positive net inflows of approximately $6.5 billion. Non-managed programs witnessed a decline in market values in the amount of $900 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to a market decline of $5.9 billion in the prior year.

Year ended September 30, 2010 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2009 - RJ Bank Pre-tax income generated by the RJ Bank segment increased $32 million, or 40%, as compared to the prior year. Net revenues decreased $58.6 million, or 19%, primarily due to a decrease in net interest income resulting from a decline in both average interest-earning banking assets and net interest spread. The net increase in pre-tax income is a result of an $88.9 million decrease in the provision for loan losses exceeding the decrease in net revenues. Net revenues were impacted as loan interest and fees decreased $62.2 million due to lower interest rates and lower balances. The average yield on the loan portfolio decreased from 4.24% to 3.97% and average loans outstanding decreased $1.1 billion, or 14%, from $7.5 billion to $6.4 billion. This decrease was a result of our strategy during fiscal 2009 to reduce the balance of loans outstanding in order to strengthen our capital position. However, loans outstanding have continued to decline during the current year as loan repayments have exceeded new loan growth. Corresponding to the decrease in average loans, average deposits decreased $1.4 billion, or 17%, from $8.3 billion to $6.9 billion. The reduced deposit balances combined with lower interest rates led to an $8 million, or 30%, decreas e in interest expense. The average cost of funds decreased from 0.32% to 0.27%. 39 The provision for loan losses continues to be impacted by certain unfavorable economic conditions including depressed real estate values and high unemployment rates. The primary factors contributing to the provision for loan losses during the current year were increased delinquencies in the residential loan portfolio, continued relatively high levels of nonperforming corporate loans, increased reserve rates for criticized commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, the stratification of the performing residential portfolio based upon updated loan to value ( LTV ) estimates with higher reserve percentages allocated to the higher LTV loans. The large prior year provision was primarily attributable to increased reserves and charge-offs due to the rapid deterioration of the credit markets, a significant decline in co mmercial real estate values, an increase in projected loss experience on residential mortgage loans, and included the write-off of one $28 million corporate loan. Net loan charge-offs for the year totaled $83.6 million compared to $107.2 million for the prior year. Corporate charge-offs during the current year included $12.5 million related to the sale of distressed debt in the secondary market with the balance taken almost exclusively on commercial and residential real estate loans. A $2.9 million increase in residential/consumer charge-offs as compared to the prior year resulted from the continued high level of residential delinquencies and declines in home values in many markets. As a result of the current year provision and net charge-off activity combined with lower loan balances, the Allowance for Loan Losses ( ALL ) increased as a percentage of total loans from 2.23% to 2.36%. The amount of nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2010 decreased $4.4 million, or 3%, as compared to September 30, 2009. Corporate nonperforming loans decreased $18.5 million primarily due to the return of three loans to performing status, the default and subsequent foreclosure of three commercial real estate loans, loan repayments, sales and charge-offs, and the partial offset by the addition of four other commercial real estate loans. This improvement in corporate nonperforming loans was partially offset by an increase of $14.1 million in nonperforming residential loans due to the ongoing economic impact on residential delinquencies. However, the growth in total delinquent residential loans (30+ days or more delinquent) has slowed substantially with an increase of $2.8 million for this year compared to a $61.1 million increase i n the prior year. Other real estate owned increased from $8.7 million to $27.9 million due to the aforementioned foreclosures of commercial real estate properties and an increase in the pace of residential foreclosures. In light of the recent moratoriums on foreclosures by some of our loan servicers, residential foreclosures could be delayed. This delay, if it is lengthy and impacts home values, could potentially result in increased write-downs on other real estate owned and increased provisions for loan losses on nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Such events could subsequently result in a decrease in our net income and in the level of regulatory capital at RJ Bank. As of September 30, 2010, the unrealized loss on our available for sale securities portfolio was $50.6 million, compared to $97.8 million as of September 30, 2009. The unrealized loss was due to continued wide interest rate spreads across market sectors related to the continued uncertainty in the residential non-agency CMOs market. Certain securities were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired ( OTTI ) during the year because RJ Bank does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, and therefore, an OTTI expense of $12 million was reflected in fiscal 2010 as a component of other loss, compared to a $12.9 million OTTI charge in fiscal 2009. Overall, the decrease in Other Loss for the year as compared to the prior year is mostly attributable to a $2.4 million gain on the sale of equity received in a loan settlement and a reduction in OTTI losses related to our available for sale securities portfolio. Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 RJ Bank Net interest income increased $106.8 million, or 50%, while pre-tax income declined $32.3 million, or 29%. The increase in net interest income resulted from the significant decline in market interest rates that occurred early in the fiscal year, leading to low interest rates being paid on the bank retail deposit accounts throughout the year. RJ Bank benefited as the rates on interest-earning assets declined at a much slower pace than rates paid on deposits. The provision for loan losses increased $114.6 million, or 209%, resulting from increased nonperforming loans and net loan charge-offs. The increased provisions offset the positive impact of the improvement in net interest income on pre-tax income. 40 Net interest income improved due to an 86% decline in interest expense resulting from lower interest rates paid on deposits. Interest income declined as well, but by a much smaller percentage (14%), as a result of lower interest rates on loans and investments as compared to the prior year. RJ Bank corporate loan portfolio is predominantly LIBOR based and LIBOR was unusually high in comparison to other rates for a period of time early in the year, generating particularly good spreads. Average total banking assets increased from $7.8 billion to $9.1 billion during the current fiscal year. However, due to reduced new loan production and paydowns on existing loans, total banking assets at September 30, 2009 decreased to $7.9 billion from $9.4 billion at September 30, 2008. Total banking assets are adjusted to exclude $3.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, resulting from the year-end gross-up to meet a point-in-time regulatory asset composition requirement. Corporate loans as of year-end decreased from $4.6 billion to $4.3 billion, while retail and residential loans decreased from $2.6 billion to $2.4 billion. Correspondingly, deposit balances also declined, from $8.8 billion to $7.1 billion, excluding $2.3 billion of deposits at fiscal 2009 year-end retained to meet the point-in-time regulatory r equirement. The loan balances at RJ Bank nearly tripled over the three-year period since September 30, 2006. This rapid growth, in combination with the impact of the significant national economic downturn on the loan portfolio, gave rise to an attendant increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, a significant decline in commercial real estate values and an increase in the actual and projected loss experience on residential loans led to an increase in the provision for loan losses to $169.3 million compared to $54.7 million in the prior year. Net loan charge-offs for the year were $107.2 million compared to $13.6 million in the prior year. Corporate loan charge-offs increased $70.3 million due to losses of $30 million in the residential acquisition and development sector and the charge-off of two commercial real estate related credi ts totaling $40.1 million. RJ Bank remaining exposure to residential acquisition and development loans is very limited, representing $37 million of the loans outstanding at year-end. The ALL increased as a percentage of total loans from 1.23% to 2.23%. The ALL and nonperforming assets at September 30, 2009 reflect the results of the annual SNC review. RJ Bank loan portfolio does not include any subprime loans. The increase in the ALL was driven by increased nonperforming assets as the loan portfolio has been adversely impacted by the current economic downturn and the decline in real estate values. Nonperforming assets increased during the year to $167.1 million from $62.3 million at the previous year-end. Credits in the commercial real estate sector, residential acquisition and development sector and loans tied to consumer spending have been particularly impacted. Additionally, increasing residential loan delinquencies have impacted nonperforming loan balances. Corporate nonperforming assets increased $51.7 million and residential/consumer nonperforming assets increased $53.1 million. A further deterioration of conditions within any given sector in which RJ Bank has significant exposure, or within the overall economy generally, could lead to substantial credit problems and additional significant provisions for loan losses and/or charge-offs. As of September 30, 2009, the unrealized loss on our available for sale securities portfolio was $97.8 million, compared to $89 million as of September 30, 2008. The unrealized loss was due to continued wide interest rate spreads across market sectors related to the continued uncertainty in the residential non-agency CMOs market. Certain securities were considered to be OTTI during the year because RJ Bank does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, and therefore, an OTTI expense of $12.9 million was reflected in fiscal 2009 pre-tax income as compared to a $4.9 million OTTI charge in fiscal 2008. Other expenses increased to $54.4 million during the year from $34.8 million for the previous year. The 56% increase was primarily attributable to an $11.3 million increase in FDIC insurance premiums as compared to the prior year, which was comprised of a special industry-wide assessment ($4 million) and increased FDIC premiums resulting from higher assessment rates issued during the year. In addition, there were $5.1 million more write-downs on other real estate owned as compared to the prior year. 41 The following table presents average balance data and operating interest income and expense data for our banking operations, as well as the related interest yields and rates and interest spread for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2010 2009 2008 Average Balance Interest Inc./Exp.

(2) Negotiable Order of Withdrawal ( NOW ) account. (3) During fiscal year 2010, RJ Bank revised its yield/cost calculations to exclude any fair value adjustments (now reflected as a Non-Interest-Earning Banking Asset) and to utilize contractual days versus 90-day quarters. In addition, RJ Bank separated from Total Non-Interest-Earning Assets the average balance for Allowance for Loan Losses. The average balance and yield/cost for certain assets as well as the Net Interest Spread, Net Interest Margin, Ratio of Interest-Earning Assets to Interest-Bearing Liabilities, and the Return on Total Banking Shareholder Equity presented for prior periods above were restated from the respective average balances and ratios previously reported. Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on RJ Bank's interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 43 Year Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to 2009 2009 Compared to 2008 Increase (Decrease) Due To Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total (in 000 s) Interest Revenue Interest-Earning Banking Assets: Loans, Net of Unearned Income: Commercial Loans $ (4,915 ) $ 957 $ (3,958 ) $ 8,431 $ (14,794 ) $ (6,363 ) Real Estate Construction Loans (8,128 ) (803 ) (8,931 ) 5,817 (8,974 ) (3,157 ) Commercial Real Estate Loans (5,528 ) (4,480 ) (10,008 ) 38,835 (70,020 ) (31,185 ) Residential Mortgage Loans (26,374 ) (12,952 ) (39,326 ) 22,758 (8,357 ) 14,401 Consumer Loans 40 4 44 410 (499 ) (89 ) Reverse Repurchase Agreements (919 ) (255 ) (1,174 ) (6,432 ) (15,086 ) (21,518 ) Agency Mortgage Backed Securities (586 ) (1,390 ) (1,976 ) 1,848 (6,272 ) (4,424 ) Non-agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (4,357 ) (194 ) (4,551 ) (2,584 ) (319 ) (2,903 ) Money Market Funds, Cash and Cash Equivalents 1,372 (2,460 ) (1,088 ) 5,235 (7,562 ) (2,327 ) FHLB Stock and Other 454 (270 ) 184 1,181 (1,629 ) (448 ) Total Interest-Earning Banking Assets $ (48,941 ) $ (21,843 ) $ (70,784 ) $ 75,499 $ (133,512 ) $ (58,013 ) Interest Expense Interest-Bearing Banking Liabilities: Deposits: Certificates Of Deposit $ (241 ) $ (1,425 ) $ (1,666 ) $ (1,323 ) $ (1,228 ) $ (2,551 ) Money Market, Savings and NOW Accounts (2,806 ) (3,498 ) (6,304 ) 30,912 (189,370 ) (158,458 ) FHLB Advances and Other 779 (765 ) 14 (3,830 ) 19 (3,811 ) Total Interest-Bearing Banking Liabilities (2,268 ) (5,688 ) (7,956 ) 25,759 (190,579 ) (164,820 ) Change in Net Operating Interest Income $ (46,673 ) $ (16,155 ) $ (62,828 ) $ 49,740 $ 57, 067 $ 106,807 Results of Operations Emerging Markets Year Ended September 30, 2010 % Change 2009 % Change 2008 ($ in 000's) Revenues: Securities Commissions and Investment Banking Fees $ 7,001 (2 %) $ 7,162 (78 %) $ 32,292 Investment Advisory Fees 4,213 211 % 1,355 (59 %) 3,326 Interest Income 337 (77 %) 1,456 (63 %) 3,987 Trading Profits 4,657 3 % 4,531 341 % 1,027 Other 431 11 % 387 (60 %) 975 Total Revenues 16,639 12 % 14,891 (64 %) 41,607 Interest Expense 244 (42 %) 421 (66 %) 1,235 Net Revenues 16,395 13 % 14,470 (64 %) 40,372 Non-Interest Expenses: Compensation Expense 15,077 5 % 14,381 (44 %) 25,860 Other Expense 7,699 6 % 7,296 (60 %) 18,064 Total Non-Interest Expenses 22,776 5 % 21,677 (51 %) 43,924 Loss Before Taxes and Including Noncontrolling Interests (6,381 ) 11 % (7,207 ) (103 %) (3,552 ) Noncontrolling Interests (935 ) (2,321 ) (126 ) Pre-tax Loss Excluding Noncontrolling Interests $ (5,446 ) (11 %) $ (4,886 ) (43 %) $ (3,426 ) 44 Year ended September 30, 2010 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2009 Emerging Markets Emerging markets in fiscal 2010 consists of the results of our joint ventures in Latin America, including Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Net results in the emerging markets segment declined $560,000, or 11%, as compared to the prior year. The operating results of the segment before allocation between us and our joint venture partners improved $826,000 as compared to the prior year. Investment advisory fees increased $2.9 million as our Argentine asset management venture continues to grow its assets under management, these assets increased 153% as compared to the prior year. Net interest income decreased $942,000 and non-interest expenses increased $1.1 million, primarily resulting from higher compensation expenses arising from the increase in fee income. Offsetting this net improvement in overall operating results was a $1.4 million increase in the amount of losses attributable to our ownership interest. Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 Emerging Markets Emerging markets in fiscal 2009 consists of the results of our joint ventures in Latin America, including Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The global economic slowdown and credit crisis continued to significantly impact emerging markets in all business lines. The results in the emerging market segment declined to a $4.9 million loss from a $3.4 million loss in the prior year. This decline was a result of a $25 million, or 78%, decline in commission revenues which was almost entirely offset by a $3.5 million increase in trading profits and a $22 million decline in non-interest expenses. Our minority interest partners shared in $2.3 million of the fiscal 2009 loss before taxes. In December 2008, our joint venture in Turkey ceased operations and subsequently filed for protection under Turkish bankruptcy laws. We have fully reserved for o ur equity interest in this joint venture.

Stock loan revenues declined 14%, with net revenues declining 17% as compared to the prior year. In the matched book business, both gross interest revenue and expense declined due to decreasing average balances which were partially offset by improved margins. The decrease in matched book activity results from reduced transaction volumes. In the box loan/box borrow business, lending from the box increased significantly, however the margin realized from this activity was also significantly less than the prior year. The decrease in the margin resulted primarily from the change in the mix of securities that were loaned this fiscal year as compared to the prior year. Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 Stock Loan/Borrow A decrease of approximately $431 million, or 45%, in average stock borrow balances from the prior year, combined with lower interest rates, resulted in net interest in this segment declining 38%. The vast majority of the balances continue to be matched book business on which average spreads declined from 0.65% to 0.41%. Expenses continue to be closely monitored and were 15% lower than in the prior year. This was not enough to offset the 38% decline in net revenues and as a result pre-tax profits declined 48%. 45 Results of Operations Proprietary Capital The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Propriety Capital segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2010 % Change 2009 % Change 2008 ($ in 000's) Revenues: Interest (1) $ 1,953 1029 % $ 173 (89 %) $ 1,526 Investment Advisory Fees 1,100 9 % 1,013 35 % 749 Other 13,976 21 % 11,556 (44 %) 20,594 Total Revenues 17,029 34 % 12,742 (44 %) 22,869 Expenses Compensation Expense 1,785 (12 %) 2,037 (45 %) 3,682 Other Expenses 2,051 28 % 1,603 (46 %) 2,974 Total Expenses 3,836 5 % 3,640 (45 %) 6,656 Income Before Taxes and Including Noncontrolling Interests 13,193 45 % 9,102 (44 %) 16,213 Noncontrolling Interests 11,465 42 % 8,067 (9 %) 8,852 Pre-tax Income Excluding Noncontrolling Interests $ 1,728 67 % $ 1,035 (86 %) $ 7,361 (1) Includes dividends received. Proprietary capital segment results are substantially determined by the valuations within Raymond James Capital Partners, L.P. ( Capital Partners ), the EIF Funds, and the valuations of our direct merchant banking investments and our investments in third-party private equity funds. As of September 30, 2010, our merchant banking investments, at fair value, include a $22 million investment in a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies, a $17 million investment in an event photography business, and a $17 million indirect investment (through Capital Partners) in an allergy immunotherapy testing and treatment supply company. Year ended September 30, 2010 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2009 Proprietary Capital Pre-tax income generated by this segment increased $693,000, or 67%, as compared to the prior year. This net increase is a result of the increase in the value of our investments coupled with the increase in dividends received during the year, a combined $4.3 million in additional revenue over the prior year. Our expenses were well controlled and approximated the prior year level. The portion of the increases in the value of the investments and the interest and dividends received, as described above, that are attributable to other investors and are therefore not ours, increased by $3.4 million. The results for fiscal 2010 include a $10.8 million increase in the value of our Capital Partners portfolio and $1.5 million in dividends received on these investments. Our third-party private equity fund investments and the EIF Funds portfolio increased in value by $3.7 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a $600,000 decrease in the value of our direct merchant banking investments. Since we do not own 100% of all of these investments, $11.5 million of the increases described above are attributable to other investors and are included within noncontrolling interests. Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 Proprietary Capital During fiscal 2009, our direct merchant banking investments and Raymond James Capital Partners L.P. portfolio increased in value by $2.4 million and $12.1 million, respectively, while the RJF private equity investment and EIF Funds portfolio decreased by $2.8 million. Since we do not own 100% of all of the investments held in this segment, $8.1 million of the net income is attributable to other investors. 46 Results of Operations Other The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Other segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2010 % Change 2009 % Change 2008 ($ in 000's) Revenues: Interest Income $ 6,269 (17 %) $ 7,597 (67 %) $ 22,824 Other 1,787 NM (444 ) 71 % (1,522 ) Total Revenues 8,056 13 % 7,153 (66 %) 21,302 Interest Expense 26,113 462 % 4,647 (68 %) 14,424 Net Revenues (18,057 ) NM 2,506 (64 %) 6,878 Other Expense 22,734 2 % 22,308 (16 %) 26,549 Pre-tax Loss $ (40,791 ) (106 %) $ (19,802 ) (1 %) $ (19,671 ) Year ended September 30, 2010 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2009 - Other Pre-tax loss arising from this segment increased $21 million, or 106%, for the year as compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven by the interest expense on our senior debt issued in August, 2009. Annual interest expense on this debt is $26 million. The increase over the prior year is because the prior year included approximately two months of this interest expense, as compared to a full year of interest expense in fiscal 2010. Total revenues increased by approximately $900,000, or 13%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to a $3.4 million increase in the value of certain investments. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest earnings on cash of $1.3 million, and $1.7 million fewer proceeds from company-owned life insurance which is held as a f unding vehicle for non-qualified deferred compensation programs. Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 - Other Revenue in the Other segment includes interest earnings on available corporate cash balances and gains/losses on corporate investments, including company-owned life insurance used as a funding vehicle for non-qualified deferred compensation programs. Expenses in this segment are predominantly executive compensation and beginning in August 2009, interest on our senior notes. This interest will be approximately $26 million annually. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is essential to our business. The primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of market environments. Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior management review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure as well as maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of ou r business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. During 2008, the unprecedented volatility of the financial markets, accompanied by a then severe deterioration of economic conditions worldwide, had a pronounced adverse effect on the availability of credit through traditional sources. As a result of concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, many lenders reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to the financial services industry. These conditions have improved and as of September 30, 2010, we had four committed domestic financing facilities available for borrowing in the aggregate amount of $360 million. See the Borrowings and Financing Arrangements section below for additional information. Liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Financing activities could include bank borrowings, repurchase agreement transactions or additional capital raising activities under the universal shelf registration filed with the SEC in May 2009, which is still effective and could facilitate such purposes. 47 Cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 was approximately $1 billion. Operating cash use resulted primarily from the increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations and other segregated assets. These assets increased as a result of the transactions associated with meeting the point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to qualifying as a thrift institution (for more information regarding these point-in-time transactions, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Increases in operating cash from net earnings as adjusted for non-cash operating items, and net increases in stock loan liabilities (net of stock borrows), were offset by the use of operating cash reflected by increases in brokerage client and other recei vables, trading instruments, and a decrease in brokerage client payables. Investing activities provided $2.4 billion, which was primarily due to a decrease in securities purchased under agreements to resell at RJ Bank, a decrease in net loans at RJ Bank, and the maturations and repayments of our available for sale securities. Financing activities used $712 million, predominantly the result of a decrease in bank deposits which were partially offset by net proceeds from borrowed funds. These financing activities arose primarily from the transactions associated with the point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to RJ Bank qualifying as a thrift institution at September 30, 2010 and 2009 (for more information regarding these point-in-time transactions, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and committed and uncommitted financing facilities, should provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity. Refer to the discussion of the potential impact on our liquidity arising from any future agreement to repurchase all or part of the ARS held by our clients in Part I Item 3: Legal Proceedings, within this Form 10-K. Sources of Liquidity In addition to the $287 million cash balance at the parent company on September 30, 2010 (see Note 26 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), we have various potential sources of liquidity as set forth below. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Our two principal domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. Covenants in RJ&A committed secured financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit balances. At September 30, 2010, both of these brokerage subsidiaries exceeded their minimum regulatory and, in the case of RJ&A, its covenant net capital requirements. At that date, RJ&A had excess net capital of $224 million, of which approximately $35 million is available for dividend (after taking into account regulatory and covenant restrictions) while still maintaining its net capital at 15% of aggregate debit items, its current internal and informal policy. There are also lim itations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without FINRA approval. Immediately following year-end, RJ&A withdrew its deposit at RJ Bank (see discussion of the RJ Bank point-in-time requirements in Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and as a result, RJ&A excess net capital increased to approximately $324 million with approximately $135 million available for dividend while still maintaining our internal target level of 15% of aggregate debit items. Subject to 30-day notification and approval by the OTS, RJ Bank may pay dividends to the parent company as long as RJ Bank maintains its well capitalized status under bank regulatory capital guidelines. RJ Bank had approximately $74 million of capital in excess of the amount it would need as of September 30, 2010 to maintain a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 12%, its current policy. During October, 2010, RJ Bank repaid borrowings from the FHLB and redirected certain RJBDP balances to other banks resulting in RJ Bank capital in excess of what is needed to maintain a total capital to risk-weighted asset ratio of 12%, increasing to approximately $149 million. In November 2010, RJ Bank made a dividend payment of $75 million to RJF which reduced its capital available to dividend. 160; RJ Bank still maintains an amount well in excess of its 12% policy level. See further discussion of RJ Bank ability to pay dividends in Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity available to us from our subsidiaries, other than our broker-dealer subsidiaries and RJ Bank, is not limited by regulatory requirements, but is relatively insignificant. 48 Borrowings and Financing Arrangements The following table presents our domestic financing arrangements with third-party lenders as of September 30, 2010: Committed Unsecured Committed Secured Uncommitted Secured Uncommitted Unsecured Total Financing Arrangements (in 000 s) RJ&A (with third-party lenders) $ - $ 350,000 $ 185,100 $ 250,000 $ 785,100 RJ Bank 10,000 - - - 10,000 Total $ 10,000 $ 350,000 $ 185,100 $ 250,000 $ 795,100 As of September 30, 2010, we had four 364-day committed and several uncommitted financing arrangements denominated in U.S. dollars and one uncommitted line of credit denominated in Canadian dollars ( CDN ). At September 30, 2010, the aggregate domestic facilities were $795.1 million and the Canadian line of credit maintained by RJ Ltd. was CDN $20 million. Outstanding borrowings on the domestic uncommitted facilities were $112 million as of September 30, 2010. Lenders are under no obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities. Committed facilities provided by commercial banks in the name of RJ&A include a $100 million bilateral repurchase agreement, a $150 million tri-party repurchase agreement and a $100 million secured line of credit. The required market val ue of the collateral associated with these facilities ranges from 102% to 133%. The interest rates for all of our U. S. and Canadian financing facilities are variable and are based on the Fed Funds rate, LIBOR, or Canadian prime rate, as applicable. Unlike committed credit facilities, uncommitted lenders are not subject to any formula determining the interest rates they may charge on a loan. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, interest rates on the utilized financing facilities ranged from 0.39% to 2.75% (on a 360 days per year basis). For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, those interest rates ranged from 0.58% to 5.00%. RJ Bank had a $10 million committed unsecured line of credit of which none was outstanding as of September 30, 2010. This unsecured line of credit is provided by a commercial bank for the sole purpose of purchasing Fed Funds to meet short-term and unexpected funding needs. Subsequent to September 30, 2010, RJ Bank elected to cancel this line of credit. RJ Bank had $2.45 billion in FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2010, comprised of several short-term fixed-rate advances and one overnight advance. The overnight advance of $2.4 billion was made to meet point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to its qualifying as a thrift institution. Due to this overnight advance, RJ Bank had less than $100,000 in immediate credit available from the FHLB on September 30, 2010 and total available credit of 40% of total assets, with the pledge of additional collateral to the FHLB. Following the repayment of the $2.4 billion overnight advance on October 1, 2010, RJ Bank had $1.1 billion in immediate credit available from the FHLB and total available credit of 40% of total assets with the pledging of additional collateral to the FHLB. See N ote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. At September 30, 2010, all of the FHLB advances outstanding were secured by a blanket lien on RJ Bank residential loan portfolio, cash deposits, and agency Mortgage-Backed Securities ( MBS ) available for sale. RJ Bank is eligible to participate in the FRB discount-window program, however, RJ Bank does not view borrowings from the FRB as a primary means of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review and may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the FRB. We maintain three unsecured settlement lines of credit available to our Argentine joint venture in the aggregate amount of $13.5 million. Of the aggregate amount, one settlement line for $9 million is guaranteed by RJF. There were no borrowings outstanding on any of these lines of credit as of September 30, 2010. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, the interest rate associated with these lines of credit ranged from 4.25% to 17% (on a 360 days per year basis). For the year ended September 30, 2009, those interest rates ranged from 4% to 18%. 49 From time to time we purchase short-term securities under agreements to resell ( reverse repurchase agreements ) and sell securities under agreements to repurchase ( repurchase agreements ). We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized financings. At September 30, 2010, there were collateralized financings outstanding in the amount of $233.3 million which are included in Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Such financings are collateralized by non-customer, RJ&A-owned securities. The average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent successive quarters and the period ended balances at each respective period end for repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are as follow s: Repurchase Transactions Reverse Repurchase Transactions For the Quarter Ended : Average Daily Balance Outstanding End of Period Balance Outstanding Average Daily Balance Outstanding End of Period Balance Outstanding (in 000 s) September 30, 2010 $ 158,489 $ 233,346 $ 326,927 $ 344,652 June 30, 2010 111,155 143,163 359,470 291,428 March 31, 2010 12,720 73,650 332,867 379,538 December 31, 2009 19,495 22,733 1,004,552 352,268 September 30, 2009 (1) 99,515 102,758 783,416 2,306,186 (1) The $2.3 billion end of period balance in reverse repurchase transactions as of September 30, 2009 was approximately $1.5 billion higher than the $783 million average daily balance outstanding during that quarter primarily as a result of RJ Bank investing $2 billion in reverse repurchase agreements as a component of its meeting the qualified thrift lender test as of September 30, 2009. Refer to Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this point-in-time test. At September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, we had other debt of $356 million and $359 million, respectively. The balance at September 30, 2010 is comprised of a $56 million balance outstanding on our mortgage loan for our home-office complex and $300 million outstanding on our senior notes due August 2019. Interest on these senior notes is payable semi-annually. These senior notes may be redeemed in whole by us at any time, or in part from time to time prior to the maturity date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon, discounted to the redemption date at a discount rate equal to a designated U.S. Treasury rate, plus 50 basis points, plus ac crued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Our current senior long-term debt ratings are: Rating Agency Rating Outlook Standard and Poor BBB Negative Moody Investor Service Baa2 Stable The Standard and Poor rating and outlook were unchanged in their latest report dated January 19, 2010. The Moody Investor Service rating and outlook are from their October, 2010 report, which reflected no change in the rating and an improved outlook as compared to their previous report. We believe our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. The rating agencies also have announced that they are reviewing ratings following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. Any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to pursue obtaining additional financing. Other Sources of Liquidity We own a significant number of life insurance policies utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. We are able to borrow up to 90% of the cash surrender value of certain of these policies. The policies which we could readily borrow against have a cash surrender value of $98 million as of September 30, 2010. The recorded value of all policies is $141 million as of September 30, 2010. There are no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of September 30, 2010. 50 On May 29, 2009 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC to be in a position to access the capital markets if and when opportune. In August, 2009 we sold $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.60% senior notes due in August, 2019 through a registered underwritten public offering. The May 29, 2009 registration statement is still effective and could facilitate future capital raising activities. See Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies section for information regarding our commitments. Statement of Financial Condition Analysis The assets on our statement of financial condition consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which are segregated for the benefit of customers), financial instruments, receivables including bank loans and other assets. A significant portion of our assets are liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. Total assets of $17.9 billion at September 30, 2010 were approximately 2% lower than total assets as of September 30, 2009. While assets segregated pursuant to regulations and other segregated assets increased significantly as compared to the prior year-end, these increases were offset by the decrease in securities purchased under agreements to resell and other collateralized financings and net bank loans. Our liabilities are comprised primarily of deposits at RJ Bank and brokerage client payables of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as various borrowings. As of September 30, 2010, our liabilities of $15.3 billion were approximately 4% lower than the prior year end. Decreases in RJ Bank deposit liabilities were partially offset by an increase in borrowings. The increase in borrowings results primarily from borrowings related to the point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to RJ Bank qualifying as a thrift institution (See Notes 12 and 22 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these point-in-time requirements). Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our short- and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership and Limited Liability Company investments, commitments to extend credit, underwriting commitments and a naming rights agreement.

As of September 30, 2010, we did not have any such investments. The Board of Directors has approved the use of up to $75 million for investment in proprietary merchant banking opportunities. As of September 30, 2010, we have invested approximately $34.9 million. The use of this capital is subject to availability of funds. These activities may be impacted by regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act. However, since the regulations have yet to be written, any impact is uncertain. We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock repurchase plan at this time. Since May, 2004, our Board of Directors has authorized $150 million for repurchases at the discretion of our Board Share Repurchase Committee. As of September 30, 2010 the unused portion of this authorization was $61.9 million. We are the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with Continental Airlines, Inc. ( Continental ). Our ability to realize our expected return is dependent upon this airline ability to fulfill its lease obligation. In the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms, we would suffer a loss of some or all of our investment. The value of our leveraged lease with Continental is approximately $7.8 million, which is included in Other Assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, as of September 30, 2010. Our equity investment represented 20% of the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual va lue of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be 15% of the original cost. This lease expires in May 2014. Although Continental remains current on its lease payments to us, the inability of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of our investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. We continue to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental obligations under this lease. In the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of ours act as general partner and may be contingently liable for activities of various limited partnerships. These partnerships engage primarily in real estate activities. In our opinion, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations of the partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. RJ&A and RJFS have been subject to ongoing investigations, with which they have been cooperating fully, by the SEC, the New York Attorney General Office and Florida Office of Financial Regulation, in connection with their sale of ARS. ARS are long-term debt and equity instruments whose interest/dividend rates are reset by periodic (typically weekly or monthly) auctions. The auctions also provided liquidity to ARS holders. Those auctions began failing in February 2008, resulting in holders being unable to liquidate investments they believed to be readily saleable for cash at par. We have been in discussions with the regulatory authorities in an effort to resolve the investigations. If we were to consider resolving pending claims, inquiries or investigations by offering to repurchase all or a si gnificant portion of these ARS from certain clients, we would have to have sufficient regulatory capital and cash or borrowing power to do so, and at present we do not have such capacity. Because we believe we have meritorious defenses and do not have sufficient regulatory capital, cash or borrowing capacity to repurchase all or a significant portion of the remaining ARS held by our clients, any action to compel repurchasing ARS would likely be vigorously contested by us. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional discussion of ARS and the potential implications of our current liquidity position on our ability to resolve these matters. Regulatory Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC in the United States and the IIROC in Canada relating to liquidity and capital standards. Our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RJ&A, a member firm of FINRA, is also subject to the rules of FINRA, whose requirements are substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not exceed 15 times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides for an alternative net capital requirement , which RJ&A, RJFS, EFD and Raymond James (USA) Ltd. have elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250,000 or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client transactions. FINRA may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its net capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit Items. RJ&A, RJFS, EFD and Raymond James (USA) Ltd. all had net capital in excess of minimum requirements as of September 30, 2010. 52 RJ Ltd. is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the IIROC) and the Early Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IIROC). The Minimum Capital Rule requires that every member shall have and maintain at all times Risk Adjusted Capital greater than zero calculated in accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such requirements as the Board of Directors of the IIROC may from time to time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted Capital may result in suspension from membership in the stock exchanges or the IIROC. The Early Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a member firm is encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain sanctions on members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 according to its capital, profitability, liquidity p osition, frequency of designation or at the discretion of the IIROC. Restrictions on business activities and capital transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective measures are sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System. RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 during fiscal 2010 or 2009. RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. See Item 1, Business- Regulation , for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which RJ Bank operates, and see Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding RJ Bank capital. Management believes that RJ Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject as of September 30, 2010. Our intention, as previously stated in prior years, for RJ Bank to become a commercial bank thereby enabling it to have a majority of its loan portfolio composed of corporate loans secured by other corporate assets and commercial real estate loans, remains unchanged. If RJ Bank were to remain a thrift, its business mix would be required to be oriented to loans related to residential real estate and other qualifying thrift assets. The recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act has the potential to impact certain of our current business operations, including but not limited to its impact on RJ Bank which is discussed in Item 1, Business- Regulation . Because of the nature of our business and our business practices, we do not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant impact on our operations as a whole. However, because many of the implementing regulations will result from further studies and are yet to be written by various regulatory agencies, the specific impact on each of our businesses is uncertain. See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on regulatory and capital requirements. Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. These critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported res ults of our operations and our financial position. Valuation of Financial Instruments, Investments and Other Assets The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes. Trading instruments and Available for sale securities are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or in our other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. We measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with GAAP, which defines fair value, establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements. Refer to Notes 3 and 4 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for these disclosures. 53 Fair value is defined by GAAP as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. We determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by GAAP to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business at each financial statement reporting period. Effective for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill, certain real estate owned and other long-lived assets. In determining fair value in accordance with GAAP, we use various valuation approaches, including market and/or income approaches. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when assumptions of market participants are not readily available, our own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. GAAP provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements: Level 1 Financial instruments included in Level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These include equity securities traded in active markets and certain U. S. Treasury securities, other governmental obligations, or publicly traded corporate debt securities. Level 2 Financial instruments reported in Level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets, but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date (i.e. prices for similar instruments). Instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded, corporate obligations infrequently traded, certain government and municipal obligations, interest rate swaps, certain asset-backed securities consisting of collateral loan obligation securities, certain mortgage-backed securities and most derivative instruments. Level 3 Financial instruments reported in Level 3 have little, if any, market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value, where significant inputs into the determination of fair value are unobservable. These valuations require significant judgment or estimation. Instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our proprietary capital segment, certain non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), certain non-agency asset-backed securities ( ABS ) and certain municipal and corporate obligations which include certain auction rate securities. GAAP requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements. The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instrument level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. Valuation Techniques The fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted. In accordance with GAAP, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. For equity securities, our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. We ha ve determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments, including certain CMOs, ABS and certain collateralized debt obligations, to be inactive as of September 30, 2010. As a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. We considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including a lack of price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels, stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makers. The specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are described below. 54 Trading Instruments and Trading Instruments Sold but Not Yet Purchased Trading Securities Trading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our broker-dealer subsidiaries (see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities. Such instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities, we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value. Matrix pricing generally utilizes spread-based models periodically re-calibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments. Valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves, interest rates and expected principal repayments, and default probabilities. Instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value. Depending upon the type of security, the pricing service may provide a listed price, a matrix price, or use other methods including broker-dealer price quotations. Positions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation. For these securities we use pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques. Assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies, loss severities, defaults and prepayments. Securities valued using these techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For certain CMOs, where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation, such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages, these securities are currently classified as Level 3 even though we believe that Level 2 inputs will likely be obtainable should markets for these securities become more active in the future. Derivatives We enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate customer transactions, to hedge a portion of our trading inventory, or for our own account. In addition, to mitigate interest rate risk should there be a significantly rising rate environment, RJ Bank may purchase interest rate caps. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. RJ Bank also enters into commitments to sell originated, fixed-rate mortgage loans as well as commitments to sell Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loans. Fair values for derivative contracts are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value, yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions. Where model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model does not require significant judgment, such derivative contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We utilize values obtained from third-party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models. The fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted, by-counterparty, against the fair value of the derivative instrument. Available for Sale Securities Available for sale securities are comprised primarily of CMOs and other residential mortgage-related debt securities. These securities are generally held by RJ Bank. Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reported in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) unless the loss is considered to be other-than-temporary, in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue. 55 The fair value of agency and senior non-agency securities is determined by obtaining third-party pricing service bid quotations and third-party broker-dealer quotes. Third-party pricing service bid quotations are based on current market data. The third-party pricing service provides comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities. The market data the third-party pricing service utilizes for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data including market research publications, and loan performance experience. In order to validate that the pricing information used by the third-party pricing service is observable, we request, on a quart erly basis, market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information. Securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For senior non-agency securities where a significant difference exists between the third-party pricing service bid quotation and the third-party broker-dealer quote, we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third-party price quote is most representative of fair value under the current market conditions. There were three instances at September 30, 2010 where there was a significant price difference as described above. Our discounted cash flow analysis indicated the third-party broker-dealer quote was more representative for two of the three securities and accordingly, we utilized the third-party broker-dealer quote to value the securities. The fair values for the remaining 23 of 25 senior non-agency securities were based on the respective third-party pricing service bid quotation. S ecurities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For the subordinated non-agency securities, we estimate fair value by utilizing discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market data where available as well as our own unobservable inputs. The unobservable inputs utilized in these valuation techniques reflect our own supposition about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing a security, including those about future delinquencies, loss severities, defaults, prepayments and discount rates. Securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end, we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities, on at least a quarterly basis, we review the characteristics of each security owned such as collateral type, delinquency and foreclosure levels, credit enhancement, projected loan losses and collateral coverage. The following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary: our intention to sell the security, our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a securi ty in full outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to period end, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, forecasted performance of the security, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the write-down recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the non-credit portion of the write-down recorded net of deferred taxes in shareholders equity as a component of AOCI. The credit loss portion of the write-down is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security. The previous amortized cost basis of the security less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the security. We estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model. Our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate, default rate, and loss severity on a loan level basis. These assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions, changes in home prices, and delinquency and foreclosure statistics, among others. Events that may trigger material declines in fair values for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to, deterioration of credit metrics, significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral, deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios, or further illiquidity. Private Equity Investments Private equity investments, held primarily by our Proprietary Capital segment, consist of various direct and third-party private equity and merchant banking investments. The valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and long-term nature of these assets. As a result, these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument. 56 Direct private equity investments are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate. Generally, the carrying values of these investments will be adjusted based on financial performance, investment-specific events, financing and sales transactions with third-parties and changes in market outlook. Investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued based on the financial statements of the partnerships. Investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Other Investments Other investments consist primarily of Canadian government bonds and term deposits with Canadian financial institutions. The Canadian government bonds are measured at fair value with any changes recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the period. The fair value is based upon recent external market transactions. The Canadian financial institution term deposits are recorded at cost, which approximates market value. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Level 3 assets were $175.5 million and $162.9 million as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and represented 13.1% and 13.2% of total assets measured at fair value as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our investments in private equity comprise $161.2 million, or 92%, of those Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2010. Our investments in private equity comprised $142.7 million, or 88%, of Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2009. These Level 3 assets represent 6.8% and 7.3% of total equity as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as Level 3 amount to less than $100,000 as of both September 30, 2010 and 2009, and represent less than 1% of both total liabilities, and total equity, measured as of the end of each reporting period. Goodwill Goodwill involves the application of significant management judgment. Of our total goodwill of $63 million, $30 million arose from our acquisition of Roney & Co. (now part of RJ&A) which occurred during fiscal year 1999, and $33 million arose from our acquisition of Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now RJ Ltd.) which occurred during fiscal year 2001. This goodwill was allocated to the reporting units; $46 million is included in the PCG segment and $17 million is included in the Capital Markets segment. We perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the equity of a reporting unit below its carrying value. This impairment testing involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities, identified intangible assets and goodwill to the reporting units and comparing the fair value of the equity of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In our determination of each reporting units fair value of equity, we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we use discounted cash flow models applied to each respective reporting unit. Under the market approach, we calculate an estimated fair value based on a combination of the multiples of earnings of guideline companies in the brokerage and capital markets industry that are publicly traded on organized exchanges, and the book value of comparable transactions. The estimated fair value of the equity of the reporting unit resulting from each of these valuation approaches is dependent upon a number of significant management assumptions. The valuation result from the income approach is dependent upon estimates of future business unit revenues and costs, such estimates are sub ject to critical assumptions regarding the nature and health of financial markets in future years as well as the discount rate to apply to the projected future cash flows. The valuation result from the market approach is dependent upon the selection of the comparable guideline companies and transactions and the earnings multiple applied to each respective reporting units projected earnings. Finally, significant management judgment is applied in determining the weight assigned to the outcome of the market approach and the income approach, which results in one single estimate of the fair value of the equity of the reporting unit. During fiscal year 2010, we updated our income approach and market approach valuation models as of December 31, 2009 for the PCG and Capital Markets reporting units which have an allocation of goodwill. Based upon all of the above, we concluded that the goodwill allocated to our reporting units was not impaired at December 31, 2009. Further, our valuation estimates for each of those reporting units indicated that the fair values of their equity were substantially in excess of their book carrying values, which include the allocated goodwill. No events have occurred since the completion of that analysis that would cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as of December 31, 2009. 57 We will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not have resulted in a reduction of the fair value of a reporting unit to an amount less than its carrying amount. Allowance for Loan Losses and Other Provisions for Losses We recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount of potential loss within that range; if the single most likely amount of potential loss within the range is not determinable, we accrue the minimum potential loss from our range of probable loss. Loss Provisions arising from Legal Proceedings We record reserves related to legal proceedings in Trade and Other Payables within our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment. We consider many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as we consider appropriate. Any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge/credit to earnings in that period. Loss Provisions arising from Operations of our Broker-Dealers We offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers, primarily for recruiting and retention purposes. These loans are generally repaid over a five to eight year period with interest recognized as earned. Additionally, there are no fees or costs associated with these loans. We assess future recoverability of these loans through analysis of individual financial advisor production or other performance standards. In the event that the financial advisor becomes no longer affiliated with us, any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts from former employees or independent contractors, management considers a number of factors including; any amounts due at termination, the reasons for the terminated relationship, the former financial advisor overall financial position, and our historical collection experience. When the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely, the outstanding balances of such loans are written-off and the corresponding allowance is reduced. We also record reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables. Client receivables at our broker-dealer subsidiaries are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients. Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. Loan Loss Provisions arising from Operations of RJ Bank RJ Bank provides an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is comprised of two components: allowances calculated based on formulas for homogeneous classes of loans and specific allowances assigned to certain classified loans individually evaluated for impairment. The calculation of the allowance based on formulas is subjective as we segregate the loan portfolio into homogeneous classes. Each class is then assigned an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans, which is then further segregated by loan grade. RJ Bank loan grading process provides specific and detailed risk measurement across the loan portfolio. The factors taken into consideration when assigning the allowance percentage to each allowance category include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and terms; changes in geographic distribution, updated loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios, lending policies, local, regional, and national economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk, past loss history, SNC reviews and examination results from regulatory agencies. In addition, we provide for potential losses inherent in RJ Bank unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted for an estimated probability of funding. 58 For individual loans identified as impaired, impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, RJ Bank measures impairment based on the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. Impaired loans include certain nonaccrual loans, nonaccrual residential real estate loans for which a specific allowance has been assigned, and both residential and corporate loans which have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. After consideration of the borrower ability to restructure the loan, alternative sources of repayment, and other factors affecting the borrower ability to repay the debt, the portion of the allowan ce deemed to be a confirmed loss, if any, is charged-off. As part of the ongoing evaluation process, charge-offs are considered on residential mortgage loans once the loans are delinquent 90 days or more and generally are taken before the loan is 120 days past due. A charge-off is taken against the allowance for the difference between the loan amount and the amount that we estimate will ultimately be collected, based on the value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. RJ Bank predominantly uses broker price opinions ( BPO ) for these valuations as access to the property is restricted during the collection and foreclosure process and there is insufficient data available for a full appraisal to be performed. BPOs contain relevant and timely sale comparisons and listings in the marketplace, and therefore, we have found these BPOs to be good determinants of mark et value in lieu of appraisals and more reliable than an automated valuation tool or the use of tax assessed values. A full appraisal is obtained post-foreclosure. RJ Bank takes further charge-offs against the owned asset if an appraisal has a lower valuation than the original BPO. If a loan remains in pre-foreclosure status for more than six months, an updated valuation is obtained and further charge-offs are taken if necessary. In addition, these loans are reviewed in a monthly delinquency meeting jointly administered by our retail banking and credit risk managers. For collateral dependent corporate loans secured by real estate, the amount of the allowance considered a confirmed loss and charged-off is generally equal to the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the appraised value less estimated costs to sell the collateral. These impaired loans are then considered to be in a workout status and we continually evaluate all factors relevant in determining the collectability and fair value of the loan. Appraisals on these impaired loans are obtained early in the impairment process as part of determining fair value and are updated as deemed necessary given the facts and circumstances of each individual situation. Certain factors such as guarantor recourse, additional borrower cash contributions or stable operations will mitigate the need for more frequent than annual appraisals. In its continuous evaluation of each individual loan, RJ Bank may consider more frequent appraisals in geographies where commercial property values are known to be experiencing a greater amount of volatility. For other corporate loans, RJ Bank evaluates all sources of repayment, including the estimated liquidation value of collateral pledged, to arrive at the amount considered to be a loss and charged-off. Corporate banking and credit risk managers hold a monthly meeting to review criticized loans. Additional charge-offs are taken when the value of the collateral changes or there is an adverse change in the expected cash flows. The majority of RJ Bank corporate loan portfolio is comprised of participations in SNC, or other large syndicated loans. The SNCs are loan syndications totaling over $20 million that are shared between three or more regulated institutions. The process for evaluating these SNC loans is consistent with the process described above for all corporate loans. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments and information available at the time of their examination. At September 30, 2010, the amortized cost of all RJ Bank loans was $6.2 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $147.1 million was recorded against that balance. The total allowance for loan losses is equal to 2.36% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio. 59 The following table allocates RJ Bank allowance for loan losses by loan category: As of September 30, 2010 2009 2008 Allowance Loan Category as a % of Total Loans Receivable Allowance Loan Category as a % of Total Loans Receivable Allowance Loan Category as a % of Total Loans Receivable ($ in 000 s) Commercial Loans $ 10,018 11 % $ 15,279 13 % $ 10,147 10 % Real Estate Construction Loans 4,473 1 % 3,237 3 % 7,061 5 % Commercial Real Estate Loans (1) 98,217 56 % 103,580 49 % 62,197 49 % Residential Mortgage Loans 34,320 32 % 28,088 35 % 8,589 36 % Consumer Loans 56 - 88 - 161 - Total $ 147,084 100 % $ 150,272 100 % $ 88,155 100 % As of September 30, 2007 2006 Allowance Loan Category as a % of Total Loans Receivable Allowance Loan Category as a % of Total Loans Receivable ($ in 000 s) Commercial Loans $ 4,471 7 % $ 3,663 12 % Real Estate Construction Loans 2,121 3 % 548 2 % Commercial Real Estate Loans (1) 35,766 49 % 10,603 28 % Residential Mortgage Loans 4,659 41 % 3,878 58 % Consumer Loans 5 - 2 - Total $ 47,022 100 % $ 18,694 100 % (1) Loans wholly or partially secured by real estate The current condition of the real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank loan portfolio. If our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. In such an event, any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at RJ Bank. Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. GAAP recognizes that the final outcome of certain tax positions we may take are uncertain, and provides standards for reflecting these uncertainties in our financial statements. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on o ur uncertain tax positions. Effects of recently issued accounting standards, and accounting standards not yet adopted In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance requiring noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity. This new guidance is applicable to the accounting for noncontrolling interests and transactions with noncontrolling interest holders in consolidated financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Accordingly, we have adopted this new pronouncement as of October 1, 2009. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the impact of the adoption of this new accounting guidance. 60 In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of the application of certain fair value pronouncements applicable to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Accordingly, we have adopted this pronouncement effective October 1, 2009. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the additional disclosures resulting from the adoption of this new accounting guidance. In February 2008, the FASB issued new guidance applicable to the accounting for transfers of financial assets and repurchase financing transactions. This new guidance addresses the issue of whether these transactions should be viewed as two separate transactions or as one "linked" transaction. The guidance includes a "rebuttable presumption" that presumes linkage of the two transactions unless the presumption can be overcome by meeting certain criteria. This new pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Accordingly, we have adopted this new guidance effective October 1, 2009. This new guidance applies only to original transfers made after that date. Since our adoption, this new guidance has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued new guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This new guidance requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents to be treated as participating securities under the two-class method and, therefore, included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Accordingly, we have adopted this pronouncement effective October 1, 2009. See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the application of this new pronouncement. In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance regarding the accounting for transfers of financial assets, as an amendment of previously issued guidance. This new guidance eliminates the Qualified Special Purpose Entity ( QSPE ) concept, creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarifies the derecognition criteria, revises how retained interests are initially measured, and removes the guaranteed mortgage securitization recharacterization provisions. This new guidance requires additional year-end and interim disclosures and is not effective for us until October 1, 2010, and for subsequent interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements to result from our fiscal year 2011 application of this new guidance. In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. This new guidance requires the reporting entities to evaluate former QSPE for consolidation, changes the approach to determine a variable interest entity primary beneficiary from a quantitative assessment to a qualitative assessment designed to identify a controlling financial interest, and increases the frequency of required assessments to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entities which we are a party to. This new guidance is not effective for us until October 1, 2010 and earlier adoption is prohibited. We do not expect significant changes in our conclusions of whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entities in which w e hold a variable interest to result from our fiscal year 2011 application of this new guidance. In July 2010, the FASB issued new guidance that will require enhanced disclosure about our allowances for loan losses and credit quality of our financing receivables. This new guidance is intended to provide greater transparency about credit risk exposures and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and other financing receivables and includes disaggregation of existing disclosures based on what management uses when assessing and monitoring the financing receivable risk and performance. Additionally, new financial statement disclosures related to credit quality indicators, aging of financing receivables, troubled debt restructurings, and any significant purchases and sales will be required. The new disclosures reflecting conditions as of the end of a reporting period are not effective for us until December 31, 2010. The new disclosures regarding activities that occur during a reporting period are not effective for us until March 31, 2011. We expect the adoption of this new accounting guidance will result in a significant increase in certain of our financial statement disclosures, but the adoption will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Information concerning our off-balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference. 61 Effects of Inflation Our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients.
