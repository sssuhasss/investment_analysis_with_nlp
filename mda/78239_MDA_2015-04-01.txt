Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, with a heritage dating back over 130 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized brand names, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Speedo (licensed in perpetuity for North America and the Caribbean from Speedo International, Ltd.), Warner and Olga . In addition, through the end of the third quarter of 2013, we owned and operated businesses under the G.H. Bass & Co . and Bass trademarks. We also license brands from third parties primarily for use on dress shirts, neckwear and underwear offered in the United States and Canada. We sold substantially all of the assets of our Bass business on November 4, 2013 and announced in January 2015 that we will exit our Izod retail business during 2015. 30 Our business strategy is to manage and market a portfolio of nationally and internationally recognized apparel and lifestyle brands at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution and geographies. We believe this approach reduces our reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, distribution channel or geographic region. We acquired Warnaco on February 13, 2013 and, with it, acquired the global Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear businesses and the Core Intimates (Warner and Olga) and Speedo businesses, which operate in North America. Prior to the acquisition, Warnaco was our largest Calvin Klein licensee, as their royalty and administrative fee payments to us accounted for approximately 37% of our Calvin Klein royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2012. The total consideration for the acquisition was $3.137 billion, consisting of $2.180 billion paid in cash, the issuance of approximately 8 million shares of our common stock (valued at $926 million), the issuance of stock awards valued at $40 million (to replace outstanding stock awards made by Warnaco to its employees) and the elimination of a $9 million pre-acquisition liability to Warnaco. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the acquisition, repaid all outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding senior secured credit facilities and repaid all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt with the net proceeds of (i) an offering during the fourth quarter of 2012 of $700 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022; and (ii) $3.075 billion of term loans borrowed during the first quarter of 2013 under new senior secured credit facilities. These items are more fully described in the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Our revenue reached a record $8.241 billion in 2014, approximately 45% of which was generated internationally. Our global designer lifestyle brands, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein , together generated over 75% of our revenue. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors of men dress shirts, neckwear and underwear, jeanswear, sportswear, intimate apparel, swim products, footwear, accessories and related products under owned and licensed trademarks, and (ii) the sale through (a) over 1,500 Company-operated free-standing retail store locations worldwide under our Calvin Klein , Tommy Hilfiger , Van Heusen and IZOD trademarks, (b) over 1,100 Company-operated concessions/shop-in-shops worldwide under our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks, and (c) e-commerce websites in certain regions under our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks, of apparel, footwear, accessories and other products, and Speedo own e-commerce website in North America of swimwear and related products. We also operated G.H. Bass & Co . stores through the end of the third quarter of 2013, at which time we sold substantially all of the assets of our Bass business. We generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. As noted above, a substantial portion of our Calvin Klein licensing revenue was generated from Warnaco prior to the acquisition and, therefore, our royalty, advertising and other revenue decreased significantly in 2013 as compared to 2012. In addition, the loss of such licensing revenue had a negative impact on our gross margin and operating margin as compared to 2012, as licensing revenue carries no cost of goods sold. We recorded pre-tax charges during 2014, 2013 and 2012 principally in connection with the Warnaco acquisition, integration and restructuring that totaled $139 million, $471 million and $46 million, respectively. The amounts incurred in 2013 included noncash charges of approximately $175 million, principally related to short-lived valuation adjustments and amortization. We also recorded pre-tax debt modification and extinguishment charges in 2014 and 2013 that totaled $93 million and $40 million, respectively. We recorded a net gain of $8 million in 2014 resulting from the deconsolidation of certain Calvin Klein subsidiaries in Australia and New Zealand and our previously consolidated Calvin Klein joint venture in India (please see Footnote 5, Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates and Footnote 6, Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion). We expect to incur additional pre-tax charges of approximately $50 million during 2015 in connection with the Warnaco integration and related restructuring. Our future results of operations will continue to be significantly impacted by the Warnaco acquisition, particularly through the operations of the Calvin Klein business and through the changes in our capital structure that were necessary to complete the acquisition, as more fully discussed below. In January 2015, we announced the closure of our Izod retail business, with the closing expected to be completed by the end of 2015. In connection with the closure, we recorded pre-tax charges of $21 million in 2014, including $18 million of noncash impairment charges. We expect to incur additional pre-tax charges of approximately $20 million during 2015 in connection with the closure of our Izod retail business. 31 On November 4, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Bass business and recorded a net pre-tax loss of $20 million during 2013 in connection with the sale. Please see the section entitled Sale of Bass within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. We acquired Tommy Hilfiger in the second quarter of 2010. We incurred pre-tax charges of $21 million during 2012 in connection with the integration of Tommy Hilfiger and the related restructuring. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses each have substantial international components, which expose us to foreign exchange risk. Amounts recorded in local foreign currencies are translated back to United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Our international revenue and profit is unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar. The United States dollar has strengthened recently against certain major currencies, particularly the Euro, which is our largest foreign currency exposure. In 2014, approximately 45% of our revenue was subject to foreign currency translation, the majority of which relates to our operations in Europe, resulting in a negative impact on our 2014 results of operations as more fully discussed below. We currently expect the strength of the United States dollar and resulting unfavorable impact on our revenue and earnings to continue into 2015 as more fully discussed below. Our calculations of the comparable store sales percentages throughout this discussion are based on local currencies and comparable weeks and, therefore, exclude an extra week in 2012, as our 2012 fiscal year included 53 weeks of operations. The following table summarizes our income statements in 2014, 2013 and 2012: 2014 2013 2012 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 7,849 $ 7,806 $ 5,541 Royalty revenue 300 291 370 Advertising and other revenue 92 90 132 Total revenue 8,241 8,186 6,043 Gross profit 4,327 4,219 3,249 % of total revenue 52.5 % 51.5 % 53.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,714 3,673 2,594 % of total revenue 45.1 % 44.9 % 42.9 % Debt modification and extinguishment costs 93 40 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, net 10 8 5 Income before interest and taxes 530 513 660 Interest expense 144 192 119 Interest income 5 8 1 Income before taxes 391 329 543 Income tax (benefit) expense (48 ) 185 109 Net income 439 143 434 Less: Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest 0 0 Net income attributable to PVH Corp. $ 439 $ 144 $ 434 Total Revenue Net Sales Our net sales were $7.849 billion in 2014, $7.806 billion in 2013 and $5.541 billion in 2012. The net sales increase of $43 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due principally to the effect of the following items: The aggregate addition of $141 million in net sales attributable to growth in our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments. Tommy Hilfiger North America net sales increased 6%, principally due to high-single digit percentage wholesale growth, retail comparable store sales growth of 2% and square footage expansion in Company-operated stores. Tommy Hilfiger International net sales increased 3%, driven principally by 32 European retail comparable store sales growth of 3%, square footage expansion in Company-operated stores and low-single digit percentage wholesale growth. These favorable impacts were partially offset by a 2% negative impact from foreign currency translation principally due to the Euro weakness experienced in the second half of the year. The net addition of $86 million in net sales in our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments. Calvin Klein North America net sales increased 6% due to the ten additional days of operations in 2014 of the acquired Calvin Klein businesses compared to 2013, combined with mid-single digit percentage wholesale growth, a 2% increase in retail comparable store sales and square footage expansion in Company-operated stores. Calvin Klein International net sales increased 1% as the impact of the ten additional days of operations in 2014 of the acquired Calvin Klein businesses compared to 2013 and the absence in 2014 of $30 million of sales returns recorded in 2013 for certain wholesale customers in Asia in connection with our initiative to reduce excess inventory levels was partially offset by a 5% decrease in international retail comparable store sales and a 1% negative impact from foreign currency translation. The decline in international retail comparable store sales is due in large part to a decrease in Asia resulting from the timing of the Chinese New Year, as fiscal 2014 did not include a Chinese New Year, while the holiday fell into both the first and fourth quarters in 2013. Also contributing to the retail comparable store decline was underperformance in Europe in the first half of the year. The net reduction of $185 million of net sales in our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments, which includes a reduction of $176 million related to the loss of net sales of the exited Bass business, as mid-single digit percentage growth in the wholesale sportswear business was more than offset by poor performance within the dress shirt business and a 5% comparable store sales decline in our retail stores (excluding the Izod retail business in the fourth quarter, which is no longer included in retail comparable store sales as the business is being exited in 2015). The net sales increase of $2.265 billion in 2013 as compared to 2012 was due principally to the effect of the following items: The aggregate addition of $1.744 billion in net sales in our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments. The Calvin Klein businesses acquired early in 2013 with the Warnaco acquisition contributed $1.635 billion of this increase. Also driving the increase was strong performance in the pre-acquisition North America businesses due to an 8% increase in the wholesale business combined with an increase in the retail business, driven by comparable store sales growth of 3% and square footage expansion. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction of $30 million in the Calvin Klein International segment due to sales returns from certain wholesale customers in the acquired Asia business in connection with our initiative to reduce excess inventory levels. The net addition of $313 million in net sales in our Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments. The acquired Speedo, Warner and Olga businesses contributed $450 million of net sales in our Heritage Brands Wholesale segment and revenue in our pre-acquisition ongoing Heritage Brands wholesale businesses increased 2%. These revenue increases were partially offset by (i) the loss of $75 million of revenue generated in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the exited Bass business, (ii) the loss of sales related to the exited Izod women and Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses, which totaled $42 million in 2012, and (iii) a comparable store sales decline of 7% in the retail business due, in large part, to weak performance at Bass during the first three quarters of 2013. The aggregate addition of $209 million in net sales attributable to growth in our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments. Within the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment, net sales increased 8%, principally driven by 4% retail comparable store sales growth, retail square footage expansion and double-digit percentage growth in the wholesale business. Net sales in the Tommy Hilfiger International segment increased 6%. Growth in Europe was driven by a 6% European retail comparable store sales increase, retail square footage expansion and a 9% increase in the European wholesale business and also included the positive impact of foreign currency translation due to a stronger Euro as compared to 2012. These increases were partially offset by a revenue decline in Japan, including a negative impact of foreign currency translation due to a weaker Yen compared with the prior year. Royalty, Advertising and Other Revenue Royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2014 increased to $392 million from $380 million in 2013. Calvin Klein royalty revenue increased 2% from the prior year period, which is the net of the effect of 4% growth driven by continued strength in women apparel, partially offset by a decline of 2% due to the absence of royalty revenue from Warnaco in 2014. The prior year first quarter included royalty revenue from Warnaco for the first ten days of the year, which were prior to the acquisition. Tommy Hilfiger royalty revenue increased 9%, driven by strength in Asia and growth across most product categories. 33 Royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2013 decreased to $380 million from $502 million in 2012, as strong performance in women apparel, handbags and accessories, as well as men and women outerwear, was more than offset by the absence in 2013 of Warnaco royalty and advertising revenue subsequent to the Warnaco acquisition, and the expiration of a long-term contractual agreement related to Calvin Klein royalties in the North America women sportswear business, which together totaled $146 million. Excluding this contractual agreement and the loss of Warnaco royalty and advertising revenue, Calvin Klein royalty, advertising and other revenue increased 8%. Tommy Hilfiger royalty, advertising and other revenue increased $7 million due to growth across most licensed product categories. We currently expect that our 2015 revenue will decrease approximately 4% as compared to 2014, including a negative impact of 7% due to the stronger United States dollar. Aggregate revenue for our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments in 2015 is projected to be relatively flat as compared to 2014, including a negative impact of 5% due to the stronger United States dollar. Aggregate revenue for our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments in 2015 is expected to decrease 7% from 2014, including a negative impact of 10% due to the stronger United States dollar. Aggregate revenue for our Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments is expected to decrease 4% as compared to 2014. Gross Profit on Total Revenue Gross profit on total revenue is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, such as inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs and inspection costs. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : 2014 2013 2012 Components of revenue: Net sales 95.2 % 95.4 % 91.7 % Royalty, advertising and other revenue 4.8 % 4.6 % 8.3 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit as a % of total revenue 52.5 % 51.5 % 53.8 % Gross profit on total revenue in 2014 was $4.327 billion, or 52.5% of total revenue, compared to $4.219 billion, or 51.5% of total revenue, in 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased 100 basis points in 2014 as compared with 2013. Of this 100 basis point increase, 60 basis points was due to the absence in 2014 of short-lived noncash valuation adjustments recorded in connection with the Warnaco acquisition and integration. The remaining increase was due to growth in our higher-margin Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. These increases were partially offset by a gross margin decline in the Heritage Brands business resulting from overall increased promotional activity in order to drive traffic and revenue, combined with poor performance in the dress shirt business. Gross profit on total revenue in 2013 was $4.219 billion, or 51.5% of total revenue, compared to $3.249 billion, or 53.8% of total revenue, in 2012. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased 230 basis points in 2013 as compared with 2012, due primarily to (i) short-lived noncash valuation adjustments recorded in connection with the Warnaco acquisition, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 60 basis points, (ii) a significant decrease in our royalty, advertising and other revenue, which does not carry a cost of sales and has a gross profit percentage of 100%, for Calvin Klein as a result of the Warnaco acquisition, which was replaced by the directly operated Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear businesses, which do carry a cost of sales and have a large North American wholesale component (that generally operates at lower gross margins than our other businesses), (iii) the acquired Speedo, Warner and Olga businesses, which operate in North America and generate lower gross margins than our other businesses, and (iv) a decrease in the Tommy Hilfiger International segment due to underperformance in Japan. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase related to the pre-acquisition Calvin Klein North America businesses resulting principally from higher average unit retail selling prices. We currently expect that the gross profit percentage on total revenue in 2015 will increase as compared with 2014, as we expect an improvement in the gross profit percentage in our Calvin Klein business and anticipate that growth in our higher- 34 margin Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses (both inside and outside of North America) will outpace growth in our lower-margin Heritage Brands business. We currently expect the strength of the United States dollar experienced in 2014 to continue into 2015 and, as a result, that the aforementioned gross profit percentage increases will be partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, as our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, which generally carry higher gross profit percentages than our North American businesses, will be translated to United States dollars at lower average exchange rates. Additionally, our international businesses often purchase inventory in United States dollars and, as the United States dollar strengthens, this United States dollar-based inventory converts into a higher amount of local currency inventory and cost of goods when the goods are sold. We expect this to be the case in 2015. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses Our SG&A expenses were as follows: 2014 2013 2012 (dollars in millions) SG&A expenses $ 3,714 $ 3,673 $ 2,594 % of total revenue 45.1 % 44.9 % 42.9 % SG&A expenses in 2014 were $3.714 billion, or 45.1% of total revenue, as compared to $3.673 billion, or 44.9% of total revenue in 2013. The 20 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due principally to (i) a 230 basis point increase due to higher retirement plan expense resulting from actuarial losses in 2014, as compared to actuarial gains in 2013 (please refer to Note 11, Retirement and Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion), (ii) a 30 basis point increase due to costs incurred in connection with the closure of our Izod retail business, the majority of which was noncash impairment charges, (iii) a 30 basis point increase due to the absence in 2014 of income recorded in the third quarter of 2013 from the amendment of an unfavorable contract, which resulted in the reduction of a liability recorded at the time of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, (iv) faster growth in the higher-expense Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses and (v) continued strategic investments in our acquired businesses, with a focus on enhancing the existing operating infrastructure, increasing investments in our people and elevating the Calvin Klein presentation at retail. These increases were partially offset by (i) a 310 basis point reduction due to a decrease as compared to the prior year in Warnaco acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, (ii) a 20 basis point reduction attributable to the absence in 2014 of the loss recorded in the third quarter of 2013 in connection with the sale of the Bass business and (iii) a 10 basis point reduction due to the net gain recorded in the first quarter of 2014 resulting from the deconsolidation of certain Calvin Klein subsidiaries in Australia and New Zealand and our previously consolidated Calvin Klein joint venture in India. (Please see Footnote 5, Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates and Footnote 6, Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion.) SG&A expenses in 2013 were $3.673 billion, or 44.9% of total revenue, as compared to $2.594 billion, or 42.9% of total revenue in 2012. The 200 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due principally to the net impact of (i) a net 400 basis point increase due to an increase over the prior year in acquisition, integration and restructuring costs incurred in connection with the Warnaco acquisition, of which 140 basis points were noncash charges, principally related to short-lived valuation adjustments and amortization and (ii) a 20 basis point increase due to the loss recorded in connection with the sale of the Bass business partially offset by (i) a 110 basis point decrease due to lower retirement plan expense resulting from actuarial gains in 2013, as compared to actuarial losses in 2012, (ii) a 30 basis point decrease in SG&A related to income recorded due to the amendment of an unfavorable contract, which resulted in the reduction of a liability recorded at the time of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, (iii) a 30 basis point decrease in SG&A due to the absence in 2013 of integration and restructuring costs related to the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, and (iv) a decrease due to the addition of Warnaco businesses, most of which are lower-expense wholesale businesses. We currently expect that our SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 will decrease from 2014, as (i) we currently do not expect our 2015 SG&A to be significantly impacted by an actuarial gain or loss associated with our retirement plans, while our 2014 SG&A included a $139 million actuarial loss, and (ii) we currently expect to incur lower costs in 2015 as compared to 2014 associated with the integration of Warnaco and the related restructuring. In addition, we expect that the impact of the stronger dollar in 2015 as compared with 2014 will result in a decrease in our SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue, as our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, which generally carry higher SG&A percentages of total revenue than our North American businesses, will be translated to United States dollars at lower average exchange rates. We expect that these decreases in our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue will be 35 partially offset by the impact of expected faster growth in our higher-expense Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses than in our lower-expense Heritage Brands business. Our actual SG&A expense may be significantly different than our projections because of expense associated with our retirement plans. Retirement plan expense recorded throughout the year is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in earnings, generally in the fourth quarter of the year, which can create volatility in our operating results. Debt Modification and Extinguishment Costs We incurred costs totaling $93 million in 2014 in connection with the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facilities and the related redemption of our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. We incurred costs totaling $40 million in 2013 related to the modification and extinguishment of previously outstanding term loans and the replacement of such term loans with the senior secured credit facilities entered into in 2013 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates, Net The equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, net during 2014 was $10 million, as compared to $8 million during 2013 and $5 million during 2012. These amounts relate to our share of income from our joint ventures for the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China, India and Brazil, for the Calvin Klein brand in India and Australia, and for the Karl Lagerfeld brand. Our investments in these joint ventures are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Please refer to the section entitled Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion of our investments in these joint ventures. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense decreased to $139 million in 2014 from $185 million in 2013 due to lower average debt balances and interest rates as compared to the prior year, combined with the effect of the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facilities and the related redemption of our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020 in the first quarter of 2014. Please see the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Net interest expense increased to $185 million in 2013 from $117 million in 2012 due principally to increased debt balances in 2013 incurred to finance the Warnaco acquisition. Please refer to the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Net interest expense for 2015 is currently expected to decrease to approximately $120 million to $125 million from $139 million in 2014 as anticipated debt payments of at least $425 million in 2015 and the full year impact of payments made in 2014 are expected to result in a decrease to net interest expense as compared to 2014. Income Taxes Income tax expense was as follows: 2014 2013 2012 (dollars in millions) Income tax (benefit) expense $ (48 ) $ 185 $ 109 Income tax (benefit) expense as a % of pre-tax income (12.1 )% 56.4 % 20.1 % The effective income tax rate for 2014 was (12.1)% compared with 56.4% in 2013 and 20.1% in 2012. The volatility in our effective income tax rate in the last three years is due in large part to uncertain tax positions which provided a benefit in 2014 and an expense in 2013. The effective income tax rate in 2014 was a benefit to income principally due to the effects of lower tax rates in international jurisdictions where we file tax returns, and a reduction of $94 million in our estimate for uncertain tax positions, 36 which provided a 24% benefit to our tax rate. This benefit resulted from the favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions in certain international jurisdictions, as well as the expiration of the statute of limitations related to other uncertain tax positions. The effective tax rate in 2013 was higher than the United States statutory tax rate principally due to the recognition of $145 million of tax expense related to changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions, which increased the 2013 effective tax rate by 44%. The majority of this expense relates to an increase to our previously established liability for an uncertain tax position related to European and United States transfer pricing arrangements. Also contributing to the higher tax rate in 2013 was an expense related to valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets from our business in Japan, and also on certain domestic state and local deferred tax assets. Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of Warnaco integration and restructuring expenses in 2013, the majority of which were incurred in the United States, which lowered our domestic taxable income in relation to taxable income in lower tax international jurisdictions. The effective tax rate in 2012 was lower than the United States statutory tax rate primarily due to the benefit of lower tax rates in international jurisdictions where we file tax returns, partially offset by non-deductible acquisition expenses incurred in 2012 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. We currently expect our effective tax rate in 2015 to be lower than the United States statutory rate due principally to the benefit of overall lower tax rates in international jurisdictions where we file tax returns. Our tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, discrete events arising from specific transactions, and audits by tax authorities or the receipt of new information, any of which can cause us to change our estimate for uncertain tax positions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Summary Cash and cash equivalents at February 1, 2015 was $479 million, a reduction of $114 million from the amount at February 2, 2014 of $593 million. This reduction included $425 million of debt repayments. Cash and cash equivalents at February 1, 2015 excluded a restricted cash balance of $20 million, which was placed into an escrow account prior to year end to contribute funding to our joint venture in Australia in the first quarter of 2015. Cash flow in 2015 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, including the amount of debt repayments we make in 2015. As of February 1, 2015 , approximately $389 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. Our intent is to continue to reinvest these funds in international operations. If management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the United States, we would be required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable United States tax rates, net of foreign taxes already paid. Operations Cash provided by operating activities was $789 million in 2014 as compared with $412 million in 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in net income, as adjusted for noncash charges in the current year period and a $57 million reduction in pension contributions. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures in 2014 were $256 million compared to $237 million in 2013. The increase in capital expenditures as compared to the prior year includes increased investments in the operations we acquired with Warnaco and combining Warnaco infrastructure with ours, inclusive of information systems, logistics and facilities. We currently expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be approximately $300 million, which includes a shift into 2015 of expenditures originally expected to occur in 2014. Capital expenditures in 2015 will primarily include investments in new stores and store expansions, as well as continued investments in operations and infrastructure. 37 Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates In 2014, we acquired a 10% economic interest in Kingdom Holding 1 B.V., the parent company of the Karl Lagerfeld brand, for $19 million. In 2013, we formed a joint venture, PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited ( PVH Australia ), in which we own a 50% economic interest. The joint venture licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to distribute and sell certain Calvin Klein brand products in Australia, New Zealand and other island nations in the South Pacific. As part of the transaction, we contributed to the joint venture on the first day of 2014 our subsidiaries that were operating the Calvin Klein Jeans businesses in Australia and New Zealand. In connection with this contribution, we deconsolidated these subsidiaries and recognized a net gain of $2 million in 2014. We also made net payments of $7 million and $1 million to PVH Australia during 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing our 50% share of the funding of the joint venture. In addition, subsequent to the end of 2014, we completed a transaction whereby the Tommy Hilfiger and Van Heusen brands in Australia were licensed to subsidiaries of PVH Australia. Tommy Hilfiger had previously been licensed to a third party and Van Heusen had previously been licensed to the joint venture partner in PVH Australia. In connection with this transaction, we placed $20 million into an escrow account prior to the end of 2014 that was paid in 2015 when the transaction was completed. This amount is classified as restricted cash, which is included in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 1, 2015. We acquired a 51% economic interest in a Calvin Klein joint venture in India, Premium Garments Wholesale Trading Private Limited ( CK India ) as part of the Warnaco acquisition. The joint venture licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the Calvin Klein trademark in India. Arvind Limited purchased our prior joint venture partners shares in CK India in 2014 and, as a result of the entry into a shareholder agreement with different governing arrangements between us and the new shareholder as compared to the arrangements with the prior minority shareholders, we were deemed to no longer hold a controlling interest in the joint venture. The former CK India subsidiary was deconsolidated in 2014 as a result and we began reporting our 51% interest as an equity method investment. We recognized a net gain of $6 million in connection with this deconsolidation. In 2012, we formed a joint venture, Tommy Hilfiger do Brasil S.A., in Brazil, in which we own a 40% economic interest. The joint venture licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks in Brazil. We made payments of $3 million and $6 million to Tommy Hilfiger do Brasil S.A. during 2013 and 2012, respectively, to contribute our 40% share of the joint venture funding. We completed a $30 million acquisition in 2011 of a 50% economic interest in a company that has since been renamed Tommy Hilfiger Arvind Fashion Private Limited ( TH India ). TH India is the direct licensee of the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks in India for all categories (other than fragrance), operates a wholesale apparel, footwear and handbags business in connection with its license, and sublicenses the trademarks for certain other product categories. We made payments totaling $2 million to TH India in 2012 to contribute our 50% share of the joint venture funding. Acquisition of Calvin Klein Performancewear Retail Businesses in Hong Kong and China We acquired the Calvin Klein performancewear retail businesses in Hong Kong and China from a former Calvin Klein sublicensee during 2014. We paid $6 million as consideration for this transaction, which is subject to adjustment. We and the former shareholders of the acquired entity are in the process of finalizing the adjustment to the purchase price. Acquisition of Russia Franchisee We acquired for $6 million three Tommy Hilfiger stores in Russia from a former Tommy Hilfiger franchisee during 2013. In 2014, we acquired for $4 million two additional Tommy Hilfiger stores in Russia from the same franchisee. Acquisition of Ireland Franchisee We acquired for $3 million six Tommy Hilfiger stores in Ireland from a former Tommy Hilfiger franchisee during 2014. Acquisition of Warnaco We completed our acquisition of Warnaco on February 13, 2013. We paid $2.180 billion in cash and issued approximately 8 million shares of our common stock, valued at $926 million, as consideration for the acquisition. In addition, 38 we issued replacement stock awards related to employee stock-based compensation grants valued at $40 million and eliminated a $9 million pre-acquisition liability to Warnaco, both of which for accounting purposes are included in the total consideration of approximately $3.137 billion. The value of the replacement stock awards was determined by multiplying the estimated fair value of the Warnaco awards outstanding at the time of the acquisition, reduced by an estimated value of awards to be forfeited, by the proportionate amount of the vesting period that had lapsed as of the acquisition date. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the acquisition, repaid all outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding senior secured credit facilities and repaid all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt with the net proceeds of (i) an offering during the fourth quarter of 2012 of $700 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022 and (ii) $3.075 billion of term loans borrowed during the first quarter of 2013 under new senior secured credit facilities. See the discussion in the sections entitled 4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022 and 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facilities below for further detail on these activities. Sale of Bass Business We completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Bass business for gross proceeds of $49 million during 2013. We recorded a loss of $16 million during 2013, which represents the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the proceeds received, plus transaction costs. A small number of our Bass stores were excluded from the sale and were deemed to be impaired. We recorded a loss of $1 million during 2013 related to the impaired stores. In addition, we recorded a gain during 2013 of $3 million from writing off certain liabilities as a result of the transaction. We also recognized costs during 2013 related to severance and termination benefits for certain Bass employees, which totaled $2 million. In connection with the sale, we also guaranteed lease payments for substantially all Bass retail stores included in the sale pursuant to the terms of noncancelable leases expiring on various dates through 2022. In certain instances, our guarantee remains in effect when an option is exercised to extend the term of the lease. We recorded an expense of $4 million during 2013 representing the estimated fair value of these guarantee obligations at the time of the sale. As of February 1, 2015, the estimated fair value of these guarantee obligations was $3 million. Sale of Chaps Sportswear Assets As a result of our acquisition of Warnaco, Ralph Lauren Corporation reacquired on February 14, 2013 the license for Chaps men sportswear that Warnaco held from affiliates of Ralph Lauren Corporation. In connection with this transaction, we sold all of the assets of the Chaps sportswear business, which consisted principally of inventory, to Ralph Lauren Corporation for gross proceeds of $18 million. Acquisition of Netherlands Franchisee In 2012, we acquired from a former Tommy Hilfiger franchisee in the Netherlands 100% of the share capital of ten affiliated companies, which operate 13 Tommy Hilfiger stores in the Netherlands. We paid $13 million as consideration for this transaction. Reacquisition of Tommy Hilfiger Tailored Apparel License We entered into agreements during 2011 to reacquire from a licensee the rights to distribute Tommy Hilfiger brand tailored apparel in Europe and acquire an outlet store from the licensee. The transfer of the rights and store ownership became effective December 31, 2012. Under these agreements, we made a payment of $25 million to the licensee during 2012. Tommy Hilfiger India Contingent Purchase Price Payments We reacquired in 2011 the rights in India to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license previously granted to GVM International Limited. We are required to make annual contingent purchase price payments into 2016 (or, under certain circumstances, into 2017) based on a percentage of annual sales in excess of an agreed upon threshold of Tommy Hilfiger products in India. Such payments are subject to a $25 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period. We made contingent purchase price payments of $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 39 Calvin Klein Contingent Purchase Price Payments In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the agreement governing that acquisition, as amended) of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $51 million, $53 million and $51 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Based upon current exchange rates, we currently expect that such payments will be approximately $52 million in 2015. Dividends Our common stock currently pays annual dividends totaling $0.15 per share. Holders of our Series A convertible preferred stock participated in common stock dividends on an as-converted basis through 2012. The last outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock were converted at the end of 2012 and the series has since been eliminated. Dividends on common stock totaled $12 million, $12 million and $11 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We currently project that cash dividends on our common stock in 2015 will be approximately $13 million based on our current dividend rate, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 1, 2015 and our estimates of stock to be issued during 2015 under our stock incentive plans.

Capital Lease Obligations Our cash payments for capital lease obligations totaled $9 million, $10 million and $11 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 2011 Senior Secured Credit Facilities On May 6, 2010, we entered into senior secured credit facilities, which we amended and restated on March 2, 2011 (the 2011 facilities ). The 2011 facilities consisted of a Euro-denominated Term Loan A facility, a United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility, a Euro-denominated Term Loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and two multi-currency (one United States dollar and Canadian dollar, and the other Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound) revolving credit facilities.

We made payments of $300 million on our term loans under the 2011 facilities during 2012. In connection with the Warnaco acquisition, we modified and extinguished the 2011 facilities and repaid all outstanding borrowings thereunder, as discussed in the section entitled 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facilities below. 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facilities On February 13, 2013, simultaneously with and related to the closing of the Warnaco acquisition, we entered into senior secured credit facilities (the 2013 facilities ), the proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the acquisition, repay all outstanding borrowings under the 2011 facilities and repay all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt. 41 The 2013 facilities consisted of a $1.700 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility (recorded net of an original issue discount of $7 million as of the acquisition date), a $1.375 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B facility (recorded net of an original issue discount of $7 million as of the acquisition date) and senior secured revolving credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (based on the applicable exchange rates on February 13, 2013), consisting of (a) a $475 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (b) a $25 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Canadian dollars and (c) a 186 million Euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in Euro, Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen or Swiss Francs. In connection with entering into the 2013 facilities and repaying all outstanding borrowings under the 2011 facilities and all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt, we paid debt issuance costs of $67 million (of which $35 million was expensed as debt modification and extinguishment costs and the remainder is being amortized over the term of the related debt agreement) and recorded additional debt modification and extinguishment costs of $6 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs. We made payments of $500 million on our term loans under the 2013 facilities during 2013. On March 21, 2014, we amended and restated the 2013 facilities, as discussed in the section entitled 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities below. 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities On March 21, 2014 (the Restatement Date ), we entered into an amendment (the Amendment ) to the 2013 facilities (as amended by the Amendment, the 2014 facilities ). The Amendment provided for an additional $350 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan A facility and an additional $250 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan B facility and extended the maturity of the Term Loan A and the revolving credit facilities from February 13, 2018 to February 13, 2019. The maturity of the Term Loan B facility remains at February 13, 2020. On the Restatement Date, we borrowed the additional principal amounts described above and used the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 7 3/8% senior notes, as discussed in the section entitled 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020 below. In connection with entering into the Amendment, we paid debt issuance costs of $13 million (of which $8 million was expensed as debt modification and extinguishment costs and $5 million is being amortized over the term of the related debt agreement) and recorded additional debt modification and extinguishment costs of $3 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs. The 2014 facilities consist of a $1.986 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility (recorded net of an original issue discount of $8 million), a $1.189 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B facility (recorded net of an original issue discount of $6 million) and senior secured revolving credit facilities consisting of (a) a $475 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (b) a $25 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Canadian dollars and (c) a 186 million Euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in Euro, Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen or Swiss Francs. The revolving credit facilities also include amounts available for letters of credit. As of February 1, 2015, we had no outstanding revolving credit borrowings and $37 million of letters of credit. A portion of each of the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facilities is also available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. So long as certain conditions are satisfied, we may add one or more term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the revolving credit facilities by an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of (1) the sum of (x) $1.350 billion plus (y) the aggregate amount of all voluntary prepayments of term loans under the facilities and the revolving credit facilities (to the extent, in the case of voluntary prepayments of loans under the revolving credit facilities, there is an equivalent permanent reduction of the revolving commitments) plus (z) an amount equal to the aggregate revolving commitments of any defaulting lender (to the extent the commitments with respect thereto have been terminated) and (2) an additional unlimited amount as long as the ratio of our senior secured net debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (in each case calculated as set forth in the documentation relating to the 2014 facilities) would not exceed 3 to 1 after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such increase. The lenders under the 2014 facilities are not required to provide commitments with respect to such additional facilities or increased commitments. During 2014, we made payments of $425 million on our term loans under the 2014 facilities, the majority of which was voluntary. As of February 1, 2015, we had total term loans outstanding of $2.738 billion, net of original issue discounts. The terms of each of Term Loan A and Term Loan B contain a mandatory quarterly repayment schedule. Due to previous voluntary payments, we are not required to make any additional mandatory payments under Term Loan B prior to maturity. 42 Our obligations under the 2014 facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect United States subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. Obligations of the European Borrower under the 2014 facilities are guaranteed by us, substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect United States subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) and Tommy Hilfiger Europe B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. We and our domestic subsidiary guarantors have pledged certain of our assets as security for the obligations under the 2014 facilities. The outstanding borrowings under the 2014 facilities are prepayable at any time without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The terms of the 2014 facilities require us to repay certain amounts outstanding thereunder with (a) net cash proceeds of the incurrence of certain indebtedness, (b) net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds, to the extent such proceeds are not reinvested or committed to be reinvested in the business in accordance with customary reinvestment provisions, and (c) a percentage of excess cash flow, which percentage is based upon our net leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2014 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) a one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% (provided that, with respect to the Term Loan B facility, in no event will the base rate be deemed to be less than 1.75%) or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2014 facilities (provided that, with respect to the Term Loan B facility, in no event will the adjusted Eurocurrency rate be deemed to be less than 0.75%). Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2014 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes at its main office in Toronto, Ontario as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the sum of (x) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar bankers acceptances having a term of one month that appears on the display referred to as CDOR Page of Reuters Monitor Money Rate Services as of 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the date of determination, as reported by the administrative agent (and if such screen is not available, any successor or similar service as may be selected by the administrative agent), and (y) 0.75%, or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2014 facilities. The borrowings under the 2014 facilities in currencies other than United States dollars or Canadian dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2014 facilities. The current applicable margin with respect to the Term Loan A facility and each revolving credit facility is 1.75% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.75% for base rate loans, respectively. The current applicable margin with respect to the Term Loan B facility is 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for base rate loans, respectively. After the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements with respect to our fiscal year ending February 1, 2015, the applicable margin for borrowings under the Term Loan A facility, the Term Loan B facility and the revolving credit facilities is subject to adjustment based upon our net leverage ratio. The 2014 facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to nonpayment; material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; cross-default to material indebtedness; certain material judgments; certain events related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; certain events related to certain of the guarantees by us and certain of our subsidiaries, and certain pledges of our assets and those of certain of our subsidiaries, as security for the obligations under the 2014 facilities; and a change in control (as defined in the 2014 facilities). During 2014, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement for an 18-month term commencing on August 18, 2014. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of capping the interest rate on an initial notional amount of $514 million of our variable rate debt obligation under the 2014 facilities, or any replacement facility with similar terms. Such agreement remains outstanding with a notional amount of $634 million as of February 1, 2015. Under the terms of this agreement, the one-month LIBOR that we will pay is capped at a rate of 1.50%. Therefore, the maximum amount of interest that we will pay on the then-outstanding notional amount will be at the 1.50% capped rate, plus the current applicable margin. During 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a two-year term commencing on February 17, 2016. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $683 million of our variable rate debt obligation under the 2014 facilities, or any replacement facility with similar terms, to fixed rate debt. Under the terms 43 of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated and we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of 1.924%, plus the current applicable margin. During 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a three-year term commencing on August 19, 2013. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $1.229 billion of our variable rate debt obligation under the previously outstanding 2013 facilities, or any replacement facility with similar terms, to fixed rate debt. Such agreement remains outstanding with a notional amount of $1.033 billion as of February 1, 2015, and is now converting a portion of our variable rate debt obligation under the 2014 facilities to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated and we will pay a fixed rate of 0.604%, plus the current applicable margin. In addition, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a three-year term commencing on June 6, 2011. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $632 million of our variable rate debt obligation under the previously outstanding 2011 facilities, or any replacement facility with similar terms, to fixed rate debt. Such swap agreement expired June 6, 2014. The notional amount of each interest rate swap and cap will be adjusted according to a pre-set schedule during the term of each swap and cap agreement such that, based on our projections for future debt repayments, our outstanding debt under the Term Loan A facility is expected to always equal or exceed the combined notional amount of the then-outstanding interest rate swaps and cap. The 2014 facilities also contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest or to satisfy our obligations under our other outstanding debt. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or extend credit; make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making distributions on, or redeeming or repurchasing, our capital stock or certain debt; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; create liens on our assets or engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our assets. The 2014 facilities require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum net leverage. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants would result in a default under the applicable facility. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable which would result in acceleration of our other debt. If we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due, the lenders could proceed against their collateral, which also secures some of our other indebtedness. We are also subject to similar covenants and restrictions in connection with our other long-term debt agreements. As of February 1, 2015, we were in compliance with all applicable financial and non-financial covenants. As of February 1, 2015, our corporate credit was rated Ba2 by Moody with a positive outlook and our issuer credit was rated BB+ by Standard & Poor with a stable outlook. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody and Standard & Poor considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies as well as our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors. 44 4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022 On December 20, 2012, we issued $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. We paid $16 million of fees during 2013 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which are amortized over the term of the notes. Subject to certain conditions, we may redeem up to 35% of these notes prior to December 15, 2015 with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings without having to pay a penalty or make whole premium. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to December 15, 2017 by paying a make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after December 15, 2017 at specified redemption prices plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Our ability to pay cash dividends and make other restricted payments is limited, in each case, over specified amounts as defined in the indenture governing the notes. 7 3/4% Debentures Due 2023 We have outstanding $100 million of debentures due November 15, 2023 with a yield to maturity of 7.80%. The debentures accrue interest at the rate of 7 3/4%. Pursuant to the indenture governing the debentures, we must maintain a certain level of stockholders equity in order to pay cash dividends and make other restricted payments, as defined in the indenture governing the debentures. 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020 On May 6, 2010, we issued $600 million principal amount of 7 3/8% senior notes due May 15, 2020. During 2012, we received the requisite consents from holders of these notes to amend the indenture governing the notes. The amendment increased the amount of secured indebtedness that we were permitted to incur without equally and ratably securing the notes. Under the terms of the consent solicitation, we paid $6 million during 2012 to the holders of the notes. During 2014, in connection with the amendment and restatement of the 2013 facilities discussed above in the section entitled 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7 3/8% senior notes and, pursuant to the indenture under which the notes were issued, paid a make whole premium of $68 million to the holders of the notes. We also recorded costs of $14 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with these notes. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of February 1, 2015 , our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period Description Total Obligations 2015 2016-2017 2018-2019 Thereafter (In millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 3,549 $ 99 $ 323 $ 1,490 $ 1,637 Interest payments on long-term debt 627 107 227 165 128 Short-term borrowings 8 8 Operating and capital leases (2) 2,046 379 581 453 633 Inventory purchase commitments (3) 1,123 1,123 Minimum contractual royalty payments (4) 77 24 32 13 8 Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans (5) 16 2 3 3 8 Sponsorship and model payments (6) 23 13 8 2 0 Severance payments (7) 16 15 1 Other contractual obligations (8) 20 20 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,505 $ 1,790 $ 1,175 $ 2,126 $ 2,414 ______________________ 45 (1) At February 1, 2015 , we had outstanding $1.912 billion under a senior secured Term Loan A facility and $837 million under a senior secured Term Loan B facility, which require mandatory payments through February 13, 2020 (according to the mandatory repayment schedules), $700 million of 4 1/2% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2022 and $100 million of 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023. (2) Includes retail store, warehouse, showroom, office and equipment operating leases, as well as capital leases. Retail store operating leases generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts listed include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Please refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (3) Represents contractual commitments for goods on order and not received or paid for as of February 1, 2015 . Substantially all of these goods are expected to be received and the related payments are expected to be made within six months of our year end. This amount does not include foreign currency exchange forward contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please refer to Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (4) Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments based on a percentage of sales when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, in some cases requiring a minimum amount to be paid. Any advertising payments, with the exception of minimum payments to licensors, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements. However, given our projected sales levels for products covered under these agreements, we currently anticipate that future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed the contractual minimums shown in the table. (5) We have an unfunded non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering certain retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. (6) Represents payment obligations for sponsorships. We have agreements relating to our sponsorship of the Barclay Center, the Brooklyn Nets and certain other professional sports teams and athletes and other similar sponsorships, as well as agreements with models and stylists. (7) Represents severance payment obligations primarily related to the acquisition and integration of Warnaco and the closure of our Izod retail business. (8) Represents a payment of $20 million to PVH Australia to contribute our 50% share of the joint venture funding. This amount is classified as restricted cash, which is included in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 1, 2015. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales, as defined in the agreement (as amended) governing the Calvin Klein acquisition, of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands and are required to be made with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $51 million, $53 million and $51 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay GVM into 2016 (or, under certain circumstances, into 2017) based on a percentage of annual sales in excess of an agreed upon threshold of Tommy Hilfiger products in India. Such payments are subject to a $25 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period. We made contingent purchase price payments of $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Not included in the above table are contributions to our defined benefit qualified pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our supplemental executive retirement, supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to 46 estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in Note 11, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately $1 million to our pension plans in 2015. Our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates. Not included in the above table are $259 million of net potential cash obligations associated with uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to uncertain tax positions. Not included in the above table are $16 million of asset retirement obligations related to leased office and retail store locations due to the uncertainty of timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 21, Other Comments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to asset retirement obligations. Not included in the above table are obligations related to our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts of future cash flows associated with such obligations. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to use Li & Fung for at least 54% of our global sourcing needs for Tommy Hilfiger products, or otherwise pay a penalty. The buying agency agreement with Li & Fung is terminable by us upon 12 months prior notice for any reason, and is terminable by either party (i) upon six months prior notice in the event of a material breach by the other party and (ii) immediately upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events relating to the other party. Not included in the above table are contractual royalty obligations related to our perpetual license agreement with Speedo International Limited. Under the terms of the agreement, our contractual minimum payments each year are $1 million, which is subject to annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. MARKET RISK Financial instruments held by us as of February 1, 2015 include cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements. Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of February 1, 2015 . Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates. Due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash equivalents, the potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on our interest income. However, there is potential for a more significant increase in short-term interest rates, which could have a more material impact on our interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at February 1, 2015 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $0.5 million annually. Borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, our credit facilities expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. We have entered into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. As of February 1, 2015 , after taking into account the effect of our interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements that were in effect at such date, approximately 70% of our long-term debt was at a fixed or capped rate, with the remainder at variable rates. Given our debt position at February 1, 2015 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in interest rates on our interest expense would be less than $0.9 million annually. Such amount excludes any impact from our United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B facility, which would currently not be impacted by a 10 basis point change in interest rates due to its adjusted Eurocurrency rate floor of 0.75%. Please refer to Note 7, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion of our credit facilities and interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses each have substantial international components, which expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands businesses also have international components but are less exposed to 47 foreign exchange risk. Changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways; a translation impact and a transaction impact. The translation impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our published financial results, as our revenue and profit earned in local foreign currencies is translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Accordingly, the impact of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Japanese Yen, the Korean Won, the British Pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican Peso, the Indian Rupee, the Russian Ruble and the Chinese Yuan Renminbi, will have a negative impact on our reported results of operations. The transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies that source goods because these goods are often purchased in United States dollars for foreign affiliates. As with translation, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our results of operations will be negatively impacted from these transactions because the United States dollar-based inventory converts into a higher amount of local currency inventory, and thus a higher local currency cost of goods when the goods are sold. We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain intercompany loans. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with these inventory and intercompany transactions, but we are unable to entirely eliminate these risks. Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease or increase, respectively, 2015 net periodic pension expense by approximately $35 million. SEASONALITY Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued in March 2013 guidance that requires an entity to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income when it ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is a foreign entity if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity. For an equity method investment that is a foreign entity, a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment related to the investment should be released into net income upon a partial sale of such investment. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2014. The adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The FASB issued in July 2013 guidance that requires an entity to present an uncertain tax position, or a portion of an uncertain tax position, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. However, to the extent (i) a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or (ii) the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the uncertain tax position should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. We adopted this guidance prospectively during the first quarter of 2014. The adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Accounting Guidance Issued But Not Adopted as of February 1, 2015 The FASB issued in April 2014 guidance that revises the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. The guidance requires that a disposal of a component of an entity or group of components of an entity be reported as discontinued operations if such disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity operations and financial results. 48 The guidance also requires additional disclosures for both discontinued operations and disposals of significant components of an entity that do not qualify as discontinued operations. This guidance becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2015. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The FASB issued in May 2014 guidance that supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. New disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers are also required. This guidance becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2017 and early application is not permitted. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued in June 2014 guidance to clarify accounting for stock-based compensation awards by requiring that a performance target that affects vesting and that can be met after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. This guidance becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The FASB issued in August 2014 guidance that requires an entity management to evaluate the entity ability to continue as a going concern on an interim and annual basis and requires additional disclosures if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. This guidance becomes effective for us in the fiscal year ending January 29, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical data and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for sales allowances and inventory returns. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for principally all wholesale inventories in North America and certain wholesale and retail inventories in Asia and Latin America is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. We review current business trends, inventory agings and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which we estimate will be needed to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at February 1, 2015 have been recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Asset impairments During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we determined that the long-lived assets in certain of our retail stores and other locations were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other factors. If different assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes a further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges. Allowance for doubtful accounts Trade receivables, as presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation 49 of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts. Income taxes Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Authoritative accounting guidance allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We would perform the quantitative test if our qualitative assessment determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit or asset. Qualitative factors that we consider as part of our assessment include a comparison of the most recent valuation to reporting unit carrying amounts, an increase in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. If we perform the quantitative test for any reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow method to calculate fair value. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analyses and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potential impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets. For the 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow method to calculate fair value. Under the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of our reporting units is reconciled to our market capitalization. Our annual goodwill impairment test during 2014 yielded calculated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for all of our reporting units. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced our plan to exit the Izod retail business in 2015. The decision to exit this business was a triggering event that indicated that the amount of goodwill allocated to our Heritage Brands Retail reporting unit could be impaired, prompting the need for us to perform a goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. As a result of this interim test, the goodwill allocated to the Heritage Brands Retail reporting unit was determined to be impaired and an impairment charge of $12 million was recorded. Within the reconciliation of the fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization, for each of our reporting units other than Heritage Brands Retail, the resulting percentage of excess fair value over carrying amounts for the annual impairment test was in excess of 37%. No impairment of other indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from our annual impairment tests. 50 If different assumptions for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests had been applied, significantly different outcomes could have resulted. If there was an extended period of a significant decline in our stock price, this could be an indicator that the minimum excess fair value of 37% referred to above could be lessened and the chance of an impairment of goodwill could be raised. Pension benefits Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. During 2014, we revised the mortality assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations of our pension plans considering future mortality improvements based on recently published actuarial tables. The improvement in life expectancy increased our benefit obligations and future expense as benefit payments are expected to be paid over an extended period of time. Note 11, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth certain significant rate assumptions used in performing calculations related to our pension plans. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on assets would decrease or increase, respectively, 2015 net benefit cost by approximately $6 million. Likewise, a 0.25% increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease or increase, respectively, 2015 net periodic pension expense by approximately $35 million. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in our operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses are measured at least annually at the end of our fiscal year and, as such, are generally recorded during the fourth quarter of each year. Stock-based compensation Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock is determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are not based on market conditions is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced for the present value of any dividends expected to be paid on our common stock during the performance cycle, as the contingently issuable performance shares do not accrue dividends prior to being earned. We record expense for contingently issuable performance shares that are not based on market conditions based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions was established using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. We record expense for the awards that are subject to market conditions ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.
