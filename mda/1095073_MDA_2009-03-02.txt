ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Industry Conditions. The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market. As a result, financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability, high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity, low rates and constrained profitability. Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor s, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written. Furthermore, the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business, domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels. We compete in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd s. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition. During the latter part of 2007 and throughout 2008, there has been a significant slowdown in the global economy. Excessive availability and use of credit, particularly by individuals, led to increased defaults on sub-prime mortgages in the U.S. and elsewhere, falling values for houses and many commodities and contracting consumer spending. The significant increase in default rates negatively impacted the value of asset-backed securities held by both foreign and domestic institutions. The defaults have led to a corresponding increase in foreclosures, which have driven down housing values, resulting in additional losses on the asset-backed securities. During the third and fourth quarters of 2008, the credit markets deteriorated dramatically, evidenced by widening credit spreads and dramatically reduced availability of credit. Many financial institutions, including some insurance entities, experienced liquidity crises due to immediate demands for funds for withdrawals or collateral, combined with falling asset values and their inability to sell assets to meet the increased demands. As a result, several financial institutions have failed or been acquired at distressed prices, while others have received loans from the U.S. government to continue operations. The liquidity crisis significantly increased the spreads on fixed maturities and, at the same time, had a dramatic and negative impact on the stock markets around the world. The combination of losses on securities from failed or impaired companies combined with the decline in values of fixed maturities and equity securities has resulted in significant declines in the capital bases of most insurance and reinsurance companies. It is too early to predict the timing and extent of impact the capital deterioration will have on insurance and reinsurance market conditions. There is an expectation that these events will ultimately result in increased rates for insurance and reinsurance in certain segments of the market, but there is no assurance that this will not be the case. Worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive. Generally, there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand. We noted, however, that in many markets and lines, the rates of decline have slowed, pricing in some segments was relatively flat and there was upward movement in some others. Competition and its effect on rates, terms and conditions vary widely by market and coverage yet continues to be most prevalent in the U.S. casualty insurance and reinsurance 47 markets. In addition to demanding lower rates and improved terms, ceding companies have retained more of their business by reducing quota share percentages, purchasing excess of loss covers in lieu of quota shares, and increasing retentions on excess of loss business. Our quota share premiums have declined, particularly on catastrophe exposed property business, due to slower growth and increased purchases of common account covers by ceding companies, which reduces the premiums subject to the quota share contract. The U.S. insurance markets in which we participate were extremely competitive as well, particularly in the workers compensation, public entity and contractor sectors. While our growth has slowed, given the specialty nature of our business and our underwriting discipline, we believe the impact on the profitability of our business will be less pronounced than on the market generally. Rates in the international markets have generally been more adequate than in the U.S., and we have seen some increases, particularly for catastrophe exposed business. We have grown our business in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. We are expanding our international reach by opening a new office in Brazil to capitalize on the recently expanded opportunity for professional reinsurers in that market and on the economic growth expected for Brazil in the future. The reinsurance industry has experienced a period of falling rates and volume. Profit opportunities have become generally less available over time; however the unfavorable trends appear to have abated somewhat. We are now seeing smaller rate declines, pockets of stability and some increases in some markets and for some coverages. As a result of very significant investment and catastrophe losses incurred by both primary insurers and reinsurers over the past year, but principally in the most recent six months, industry-wide capital has declined and rating agency scrutiny has increased. There is an expectation that given the rate softening that has occurred over the past several quarters, the industry-wide decline in capital combined with volatile and unreceptive markets and a looming recession, will lead to a hardening of insurance and reinsurance marketplace rates, terms and conditions. It is too early to gauge the extent of hardening, if any, that will occur; however, it appears that much of the redundant capital has been wrung out of the industry, and the stage is set for firmer markets. January, 2009, renewal rates, particularly for property catastrophes and retrocessional covers and in international markets were generally firmer compared to a year ago. Overall, we believe that current marketplace conditions offer profit opportunities for us given our strong ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise. We continue to employ our strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential, while maintaining balance and diversification in our overall portfolio. 48 Financial Summary. We monitor and evaluate our overall performance based upon financial results. The following table displays a summary of the consolidated net (loss) income, ratios and shareholders equity for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Percentage Increase/(Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Gross written premiums $ 3,678.1 $ 4,077.6 $ 4,000.9 -9.8% 1.9% Net written premiums 3,505.2 3,919.4 3,875.7 -10.6% 1.1% REVENUES: Premiums earned $ 3,694.3 $ 3,997.5 $ 3,853.2 -7.6% 3.7% Net investment income 565.9 682.4 629.4 -17.1% 8.4% Net realized capital (losses) gains (695.8) 86.3 35.1 NM 146.1% Net derivative expense (20.9) (2.1) (0.4) NM NM Other (expense) income (15.9) 18.0 0.1 -188.2% NM Total revenues 3,527.6 4,782.0 4,517.3 -26.2% 5.9% CLAIMS AND EXPENSES: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 2,439.0 2,548.1 2,434.4 -4.3% 4.7% Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees 930.7 961.8 883.3 -3.2% 8.9% Other underwriting expenses 162.3 152.6 138.0 6.4% 10.6% Interest, fees and bond issue cost amortization expense 79.2 91.6 69.9 -13.5% 31.0% Total claims and expenses 3,611.2 3,754.1 3,525.6 -3.8% 6.5% (LOSS) INCOME BEFORE TAXES (83.6) 1,028.0 991.8 -108.1% 3.7% Income tax (benefit) expense (64.8) 188.7 150.9 -134.4% 25.0% NET (LOSS) INCOME $ (18.8) $ 839.3 $ 840.8 -102.2% -0.2% RATIOS: Point Change Loss ratio 66.0% 63.7% 63.2% 2.3 0.5 Commission and brokerage ratio 25.2% 24.1% 22.9% 1.1 1.2 Other underwriting expense ratio 4.4% 3.8% 3.6% 0.6 0.2 Combined ratio 95.6% 91.6% 89.7% 4.0 1.9 At December 31, Percentage Increase/(Decrease) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Balance sheet data: Total investments and cash $ 13,714.3 $ 14,936.2 $ 13,957.1 -8.2% 7.0% Total assets 16,846.6 17,999.5 17,107.6 -6.4% 5.2% Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 8,840.7 9,040.6 8,840.1 -2.2% 2.3% Total debt 1,179.1 1,178.9 995.6 0.0% 18.4% Total liabilities 11,886.2 12,314.7 11,999.9 -3.5% 2.6% Shareholders' equity 4,960.4 5,684.8 5,107.7 -12.7% 11.3% Book value per share 80.77 90.43 78.53 (NM, not meaningful) (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) 49 Revenues. Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by $399.4 million, or 9.8%, in 2008 compared to 2007, reflecting a decline of $285.6 million in our reinsurance business and $113.8 million in our U.S. insurance business. The decline in our reinsurance business was primarily attributable to continued competitive conditions in both the property and casualty sectors of the market, especially in the U.S., partially offset by strong renewals and higher rates in international markets. Insurance segment premiums were also lower, as conditions for workers compensation, public equity and contractors business became increasingly competitive, which reduced the volume of business that met our underwriting and pricing criteria. Net written premiums decreased $414.2 million, or 10.6%, in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the decrease in gross written premiums and an increase in written premiums ceded, most of which was in the U.S. insurance segment. Correspondingly, premiums earned decreased $303.2 million, or 7.6%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The lesser percentage decrease in net premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are reflected at the initiation of the coverage period. Gross written premiums increased by $76.7 million, or 1.9%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting growth of $57.4 million in our reinsurance business and $19.3 million in our U.S. insurance business. The increase in our reinsurance business is primarily attributable to the strengthening of other currencies against the U.S. dollar. Premiums written in strengthening currencies converted to more U.S. dollars resulting in comparatively higher reported premiums. Net written premiums increased $43.7 million, or 1.1%, in 2007 compared to 2006, slightly less than the growth in gross written premiums due to the change in the mix of our program business and the resulting change in reinsurance. Premiums earned increased $144.3 million, or 3.7%, in 2007 compared to 2006. Net Investment Income . Net investment income decreased by 17.1% in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a net investment loss from our limited partnership investments, particularly those which were principally invested in public equities, and lower rates on short and long term bonds. Pre-tax investment income as a percentage of average invested assets was 4.0% for 2008 compared to 4.9% for 2007. Net investment income increased by 8.4% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the growth in invested assets to $14.9 billion at December 31, 2007 from $14.0 billion at December 31, 2006. The growth in invested assets was principally driven by $854.4 million of operating cash flows. Pre-tax investment portfolio yield for 2007 was 4.9% compared to 4.8% for 2006. Net Realized Capital (Losses) Gains. Net realized capital losses were $695.8 million for 2008, while 2007 and 2006 had net realized capital gains of $86.3 million and $35.1 million, respectively. The net realized capital losses for 2008 were primarily the result of the credit crisis impacting the global financial markets, which drove down the values of equity and fixed income securities. As such, our equity security portfolio decreased $277.5 million as a result of fair value adjustments and our fixed maturities decreased $176.5 million due to other-than-temporary impairments. In addition, we recognized $243.3 million of net realized capital losses, principally from the sale of equity securities we owned as we realigned our investment portfolios. We report changes in fair values of our equity securities as realized capital gains or losses in accordance with FAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115 ( FAS 159 ), and we report realized losses on our fixed income portfolio from other-than-temporary impairments as realized capital losses in accordance with FAS No. 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments ( FAS 115-1 ). Net realized gains in 2007 consisted of $76.6 million in changes in fair value of the equity securities and $18.1 million from sales of equity securities and fixed maturity securities, partially offset by $8.4 million of other-than-temporary impairments of the fixed maturity securities. Net realized gains in 2006 were the result of sales from fixed maturities of $12.8 million and equity securities of $22.3 million. 50 Net Derivative Expense. In 2005 and prior, we sold seven equity index put options, which are outstanding. These contracts meet the definition of a derivative under FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( FAS 133 ). We recognized net derivative expense of $20.9 million, $2.1 million and $0.4 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net derivative expense represents changes in the fair value of these contracts. The increased expense in 2008 was driven by declines in the underlying indexes and interest rates, which are the primary determinants of the contracts fair values. Other (Expense) Income. We recorded expense of $15.9 million for 2008 and income of $18.0 million and $0.1 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, which were primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates over the periods. Claims and Expenses. Incurred Losses and LAE. The following table presents our incurred losses and LAE for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Current Ratio %/ Prior Ratio %/ Total Ratio %/ (Dollars in millions) Year Pt Change Years Pt Change Incurred Pt Change 2008 Attritional (a) $ 2,050.3 55.5% $ 24.4 0.7% $ 2,074.7 56.2% Catastrophes 353.8 9.6% 10.5 0.3% 364.3 9.9% A&E - 0.0% - 0.0% - 0.0% Total segment $ 2,404.1 65.1% $ 34.9 0.9% $ 2,439.0 66.0% 2007 Attritional (a) $ 2,189.3 54.8% $ (188.7) -4.7% $ 2,000.6 50.0% Catastrophes 152.3 3.8% 7.7 0.2% 160.0 4.0% A&E - 0.0% 387.5 9.7% 387.5 9.7% Total segment $ 2,341.6 58.6% $ 206.5 5.2% $ 2,548.1 63.7% 2006 Attritional (a) $ 2,283.2 59.3% $ (243.3) -6.3% $ 2,039.9 52.9% Catastrophes 15.6 0.4% 272.3 7.1% 287.9 7.5% A&E - 0.0% 106.6 2.8% 106.6 2.8% Total segment $ 2,298.8 59.7% $ 135.6 3.5% $ 2,434.4 63.2% Variance 2008/2007 Attritional (a) $ (139.0) 0.7 pts $ 213.1 5.4 pts $ 74.1 6.1 pts Catastrophes 201.5 5.8 pts 2.7 0.1 pts 204.3 5.9 pts A&E - - pts (387.5) (9.7) pts (387.5) (9.7) pts Total segment $ 62.5 6.5 pts $ (171.7) (4.3) pts $ (109.2) 2.3 pts Variance 2007/2006 Attritional (a) $ (93.9) (4.5) pts $ 54.6 1.6 pts $ (39.3) (2.9) pts Catastrophes 136.7 3.4 pts (264.6) (6.9) pts (127.9) (3.5) pts A&E - - pts 280.9 6.9 pts 280.9 6.9 pts Total segment $ 42.8 (1.1) pts $ 70.9 1.7 pts $ 113.7 0.5 pts (a) Attritional losses exclude catastrophe and A&E losses. (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Incurred losses and LAE were lower by $109.2 million, or 4.3%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Attritional losses were lower than in 2007, largely the result of lower net earned premiums. The current year attritional loss ratio crept up by 0.7 points compared to 2007, the result of softer rates in the U.S. reinsurance segment mitigated somewhat by improved loss ratios in the other segments, particularly, international. We experienced $24.4 million of adverse reserve development on our attritional reserves in 2008 compared to $188.7 million of favorable reserve development in 2007. The adverse development in 2008 was the result of $85.3 million of development on loss reserves for a run-off auto loan credit insurance program and 51 a $32.6 million adverse arbitration decision. These items more than offset approximately $93.5 million of favorable development on the remainder of our attritional reserves. Catastrophe losses, at $364.3 million, were $204.3 million higher than in 2007, driven by hurricanes Gustav and Ike and a major snowstorm in China. While 2008 ranks as one of the costliest years on record for insured natural catastrophe losses, our losses were generally in line with our modeled expected annual aggregate catastrophe losses as developed through our enterprise risk and catastrophe exposure management processes. We strengthened our asbestos reserves by $387.5 million in 2007, and had no development in 2008 as loss activity in 2008 was in line with expected as per the reserves established at December 31, 2007. Incurred losses and LAE increased by $113.7 million, or 4.7%, in 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $280.9 million increase in A&E loss reserve strengthening, which was partially offset by lower catastrophe losses of $127.9 million and lower attritional losses of $39.3 million. The increase in A&E reserves was due to an extensive in-house study by our actuarial and claim units. The decrease in catastrophe losses reflects the decrease in prior years development. Commission, Brokerage, Taxes and Fees. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees decreased by $31.1 million, or 3.2%, in 2008 compared to 2007. This directly variable expense was influenced by the decline in net earned premiums partially offset by higher commission rates on new insurance programs, higher contingent commissions and higher ceding commissions on some reinsurance treaties due to more competitive market conditions as well as business mix. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $78.5 million, or 8.9% in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net earned premiums, an increase in ceding commissions due to market conditions and higher commissions on new insurance programs were the principal drivers of the increase. Other Underwriting Expenses. Other underwriting expenses for 2008 were $162.3 million compared to $152.6 million for 2007. The increase is primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense resulting from increased staff, primarily in the U.S. Insurance segment. Included in other underwriting expenses were corporate expenses, which are expenses that are not allocated to segments, of $13.8 million and $13.1 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other underwriting expenses for 2007 were $152.6 million compared to $138.0 million for 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense resulting from increased staff, primarily in the U.S. Insurance segment. Included in other underwriting expenses were corporate expenses of $13.1 million and $26.5 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the allocation of share-based compensation expense in 2007 to segments. Interest, Fees and Bond Issue Cost Amortization Expense. Interest and other expense was $79.2 million and $91.6 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the acceleration of amortization of the bond issue costs for the junior subordinated debt securities which were retired in November, 2007, with no such expense in 2008. In addition, the interest reduction on the retired junior subordinated notes was partially offset by the interest on the new long term notes. Interest and other expense was $91.6 million and $69.9 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase was due to the new long term notes we issued in April, 2007 and the acceleration of the amortization of the bond issue costs associated with the November 15, 2007 early retirement of the 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities. 52 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. Our income tax was a benefit of $64.8 million in 2008, principally as a result of net realized capital losses due to fair value re-measurements, other-than-temporary impairments and losses on sales of public equity securities. We had income tax expense of $188.7 million and $150.9 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily due to income from operations and net realized capital gains in both periods. Our income tax is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding pre-tax income in the jurisdictions where we operate, coupled with the impact from tax-preferenced investment income. Variations in our effective tax rate generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income among jurisdictions with different tax rates. Net (Loss) Income. Our net loss was $18.8 million for 2008 compared to $839.3 million of net income for 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by after-tax net realized capital losses and increased catastrophe losses in 2008 compared to after-tax net realized capital gains and fewer catastrophe losses in 2007. Ratios. Our combined ratio increased by 4.0 points to 95.6% for 2008 compared to 91.6% for 2007. The loss ratio component increased 2.3 points for 2008, principally due to the increase in current year catastrophe losses and attritional prior years reserve development, partially offset by the absence of development on A&E reserves in 2008. The commission and brokerage ratio component increased by 1.1 points for 2008 due to the increased commission rates on new insurance programs and higher contingent commissions. The other underwriting expense ratio component increased minimally by 0.6 points for 2008. Our combined ratio increased by 1.9 points to 91.6% in 2007 compared to 89.7% in 2006. The loss ratio component increased 0.5 points for 2007, principally due to prior year A&E losses. The commission and brokerage ratio component increased by 1.2 points for 2007. The underwriting expense ratio component increased minimally by 0.2 points for 2007. Shareholders Equity. Shareholders equity decreased by $724.4 million to $4,960.4 million in 2008 from $5,684.8 million in 2007, principally as a result of $236.6 million of unrealized depreciation, net of tax, on investments, $193.3 million of foreign currency translation adjustments, the repurchase of 1.6 million common shares for $150.7 million, $118.6 million of shareholder dividends, pension adjustments, net of tax, of $25.2 million and net loss of $18.8 million, partially offset by share-based compensation transactions of $20.0 million. The increase in unrealized depreciation is due to the current financial market liquidity crisis that has resulted in significantly increased credit spreads and concomitantly lower corporate and municipal security values. Shareholders equity increased by $577.1 million to $5,684.8 million in 2007 from $5,107.7 million in 2006, principally as a result of the $839.3 million of net income, $65.4 million from foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized appreciation and pension adjustments, and $35.1 million of share-based compensation transactions, partially offset by the repurchase of 2.5 million common shares at a cost of $241.6 million and the payment of $121.4 million of shareholder dividends. Consolidated Investment Results Net Investment Income. Net investment income decreased 17.1% to $565.9 million in 2008 from $682.4 million in 2007, primarily due to losses incurred on our limited partnership investments, particularly those that invested in public equity securities, in 2008 compared to income in 2007. Net investment income increased 8.4% to $682.4 million in 2007 from $629.4 million in 2006, primarily due to a growth in invested assets to $14.9 billion at December 31, 2007 from $14.0 billion at December 31, 2006. The asset growth emanated largely from continued positive cash flow from operations. 53 The following table shows the components of net investment income for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Fixed maturities $ 543.4 $ 496.6 $ 508.5 Equity securities 19.9 24.7 21.2 Short-term investments and cash 52.1 109.1 61.0 Other invested assets Limited partnerships (42.2) 59.2 54.7 Other 2.3 3.1 2.9 Total gross investment income 575.5 692.7 648.4 Interest credited and other expense (9.6) (10.3) (19.0) Total net investment income $ 565.9 $ 682.4 $ 629.4 . (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the periods indicated: 2008 2007 2006 Imbedded pre-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 4.5% 4.7% 4.6% Imbedded after-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 4.0% 3.9% 4.0% Annualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 4.0% 4.9% 4.8% Annualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 3.4% 4.1% 4.2% Because of our historical income orientation, we have generally managed our investments to maximize reportable income. The following table provides a comparison of our total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the periods indicated: 2008 2007 2006 Fixed income portfolio total return 0.3% 5.0% 4.6% Lehman bond aggregate index 5.2% 7.0% 4.3% Common equity portfolio total return -40.9% 9.2% 19.2% S&P 500 index -37.0% 5.5% 15.8% Other invested asset portfolio total return -7.4% 13.5% 19.8% The pre-tax equivalent total return for the bond portfolio was approximately 2.1%, 5.7% and 5.3%, respectively, for 2008, 2007 and 2006. The pre-tax equivalent return adjusts the yield on tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent. 54 Net Realized Capital (Losses) Gains. The following table presents the composition of our net realized capital (losses) gains for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Variance % Change Variance % Change (Losses) gains from sales: Fixed maturities, market value Gains $ 14.5 $ 2.6 $ 14.9 $ 11.9 NM $ (12.3) -82.6% Losses (27.2) (8.5) (2.0) (18.7) 220.0% (6.5) NM Total (12.6) (5.9) 12.8 (6.7) 113.6% (18.7) -145.6% Fixed maturities, fair value Gains 0.1 - - 0.1 NM - NM Losses - - - - NM - NM Total 0.1 - - 0.1 NM - NM Equity securities, market value Gains - - 34.1 - NM (34.1) -100.0% Losses - - (11.8) - NM 11.8 -100.0% Total - - 22.3 - NM (22.3) -100.0% Equity securities, fair value Gains 23.4 45.9 - (22.5) -49.0% 45.9 NM Losses (254.1) (22.0) - (232.1) NM (22.0) NM Total (230.6) 24.0 - (254.6) NM 24.0 NM Total net realized capital (losses) gains from sales Gains 38.0 48.5 49.0 (10.5) -21.6% (0.5) -1.0% Losses (281.3) (30.4) (13.9) (250.9) NM (16.6) 119.8% Total (243.3) 18.1 35.1 (261.4) NM (17.1) -48.7% Other-than-temporary impairments: (176.5) (8.4) - (168.1) NM (8.4) NM (Losses) gains from fair value adjustments: Fixed maturities, fair value 1.5 - - 1.5 NM - NM Equity securities, fair value (277.5) 76.6 - (354.1) NM 76.6 NM Total (276.0) 76.6 - (352.6) NM 76.6 NM Total net realized capital (losses) gains $ (695.8) $ 86.3 $ 35.1 $ (782.1) NM $ 51.1 145.6% (NM, not meaningful) (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) We recorded $276.0 million in net realized capital losses due to fair value re-measurement on fixed maturities and equity securities for 2008 and $76.6 million of net realized capital gains due to fair value re-measurements on equity securities for 2007. In addition, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $176.5 million and $8.4 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. These net realized capital losses were attributable to the current financial liquidity crisis and related global economic downturn. Numerous financial corporations have either filed for bankruptcy or received assistance from the U.S. Government. This activity has severely impacted both the equity and credit markets. Equities are trading at multiyear lows, spreads on fixed maturities are at unprecedented levels and many securities have been downgraded by rating agencies. 55 Segment Results. Through our subsidiaries, we operate in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agents and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation writes non-U.S. property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re branches in Canada and Singapore and offices in Miami and New Jersey. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch. These segments are managed in a coordinated fashion with respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations. Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses. We measure our underwriting results using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned premium. We utilize inter-affiliate reinsurance, although such reinsurance does not materially impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced. Our loss and LAE reserves are our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We re-evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including all prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, recently reported loss claim experience and trends related to prior periods. Such re-evaluations are recorded in incurred losses in the period in which re-evaluation is made. 56 The following discusses the underwriting results for each of our segments for the periods indicated: U.S. Reinsurance. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the U.S. Reinsurance segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Variance % Change Variance % Change Gross written premiums $ 957.9 $ 1,193.5 $ 1,336.7 $ (235.6) -19.7% $ (143.2) -10.7% Net written premiums 948.8 1,183.1 1,331.7 (234.3) -19.8% (148.6) -11.2% Premiums earned $ 1,050.3 $ 1,282.9 $ 1,281.1 $ (232.5) -18.1% $ 1.8 0.1% Incurred losses and LAE 798.2 705.4 851.2 92.8 13.1% (145.8) -17.1% Commission and brokerage 273.3 327.2 298.1 (53.9) -16.5% 29.1 9.8% Other underwriting expenses 32.2 33.3 24.9 (1.1) -3.3% 8.3 33.4% Underwriting (loss) gain $ (53.3) $ 217.0 $ 106.8 $ (270.3) -124.6% $ 110.2 103.1% Point Chg Point Chg Loss ratio 76.0% 55.0% 66.4% 21.0 (11.4) Commission and brokerage ratio 26.0% 25.5% 23.3% 0.5 2.2 Other underwriting expense ratio 3.1% 2.6% 2.0% 0.5 0.6 Combined ratio 105.1% 83.1% 91.7% 22.0 (8.6) (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by 19.7% to $957.9 million in 2008 from $1,193.5 million in 2007, primarily due to a $104.9 million (14.7%) decrease in treaty property volume, a $71.7million (21.6%) decrease in treaty casualty volume and a $57.9 million (39.9%) decrease in facultative volume. Property premiums were lower due to increased common account reinsurance protections, particularly on one Florida quota share account and two quota share non-renewals. Our treaty casualty premium was lower than last year as we reduced this book to a group of core accounts in response to the softer market conditions. Facultative volume decreased due to ceding companies retaining a greater portion of gross premiums and a marketplace that remains competitive. Net written premiums decreased 19.8% to $948.8 million in 2008 compared to $1,183.1 million in 2007, primarily due to the decrease in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned correspondingly decreased 18.1% to $1,050.3 million for 2008 compared to $1,282.9 million for 2007, consistent with the change in net written premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by 10.7% to $1,193.5 million for 2007 from $1,336.7 million for 2006, primarily due to a $202.6 million (37.9%) decrease in treaty casualty volume and a $70.5 million (32.7%) decrease in facultative volume, partially offset by a $126.8 million (21.6%) increase in treaty property volume. The increase in treaty property writings emanated principally from new quota share treaties. The more competitive environment for the U.S. casualty business resulted in reduced opportunities to write this business profitably. Net written premiums decreased 11.2% to $1,183.1 million for 2007 compared to $1,331.7 million for 2006, primarily due to the decrease in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased slightly to $1,282.9 million for 2007 compared to $1,281.1 million for 2006. The change in net premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. 57 Incurred Losses and LAE. The following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the U.S. Reinsurance segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Current Ratio %/ Prior Ratio %/ Total Ratio %/ (Dollars in millions) Year Pt Change Years Pt Change Incurred Pt Change 2008 Attritional $ 471.3 44.9% $ 52.9 5.0% $ 524.2 49.9% Catastrophes 253.5 24.1% 20.4 1.9% 273.9 26.1% A&E - 0.0% - 0.0% - 0.0% Total segment $ 724.9 69.0% $ 73.3 7.0% $ 798.2 76.0% 2007 Attritional $ 583.9 45.5% $ (139.9) -10.9% $ 443.9 34.6% Catastrophes 0.1 0.0% (5.0) -0.4% (4.9) -0.4% A&E - 0.0% 266.4 20.8% 266.4 20.8% Total segment $ 584.0 45.5% $ 121.4 9.5% $ 705.4 55.0% 2006 Attritional $ 683.6 53.4% $ (50.4) -3.9% $ 633.2 49.4% Catastrophes 8.9 0.7% 181.7 14.2% 190.6 14.9% A&E - 0.0% 27.4 2.1% 27.4 2.1% Total segment $ 692.5 54.1% $ 158.7 12.4% $ 851.2 66.4% Variance 2008/2007 Attritional $ (112.5) (0.6) pts $ 192.8 15.9 pts $ 80.3 15.3 pts Catastrophes 253.4 24.1 pts 25.4 2.3 pts 278.8 26.5 pts A&E - - pts (266.4) (20.8) pts (266.4) (20.8) pts Total segment $ 140.9 23.5 pts $ (48.1) (2.5) pts $ 92.8 21.0 pts Variance 2007/2006 Attritional $ (99.8) (7.9) pts $ (89.5) (7.0) pts $ (189.3) (14.8) pts Catastrophes (8.8) (0.7) pts (186.7) (14.6) pts (195.5) (15.3) pts A&E - - pts 239.0 18.6 pts 239.0 18.6 pts Total segment $ (108.5) (8.6) pts $ (37.2) (2.9) pts $ (145.8) (11.4) pts (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Incurred losses were $92.8 million (21.0 points) higher in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and unfavorable reserve development on prior years losses, including $32.6 million for an unfavorable arbitration decision relating to a 2001 retrocessional cover. We had no reserve adjustments in 2008 for A&E losses, which experienced $266.4 million adverse development in 2007. Incurred losses were $145.8 (11.4 points) lower for 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. We experienced $181.7 million of catastrophe loss development in 2006 which did not recur in 2007, which contributed another 14.6 points. In addition, we had a greater amount of favorable reserve development related to prior years, which provided 7.0 points of improvement. These favorable factors were partially mitigated by an 18.6 point increase driven by asbestos reserve strengthening. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage expenses decreased to $273.3 million for 2008 from $327.2 million in 2007 or by 16.5%, generally in line with the 18.1% decrease in net earned premiums. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2008 decreased slightly to $32.2 million from $33.3 million for 2007. Commission and brokerage increased by 9.8% to $327.2 million for 2007 from $298.1 million in 2006, principally due to an $18.9 million increase in contingent commissions and somewhat higher base ceding commissions. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to $33.3 million from $24.9 million 58 for 2006, principally due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. U.S. Insurance. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the U.S. Insurance segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Variance % Change Variance % Change Gross written premiums $ 771.8 $ 885.6 $ 866.3 $ (113.8) -12.9% $ 19.3 2.2% Net written premiums 617.0 744.3 753.3 (127.3) -17.1% (9.0) -1.2% Premiums earned $ 705.5 $ 735.9 $ 761.7 $ (30.4) -4.1% $ (25.8) -3.4% Incurred losses and LAE 549.9 556.4 519.9 (6.5) -1.2% 36.5 7.0% Commission and brokerage 146.7 136.2 123.1 10.5 7.7% 13.1 10.7% Other underwriting expenses 64.3 58.2 48.9 6.1 10.5% 9.3 19.0% Underwriting (loss) gain $ (55.4) $ (14.9) $ 69.8 $ (40.5) NM $ (84.7) -121.3% Point Chg Point Chg Loss ratio 77.9% 75.6% 68.3% 2.3 7.3 Commission and brokerage ratio 20.8% 18.5% 16.1% 2.3 2.4 Other underwriting expense ratio 9.2% 7.9% 6.4% 1.3 1.5 Combined ratio 107.9% 102.0% 90.8% 5.9 11.2 (NM, not meaningful) (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by 12.9% to $771.8 million for 2008 from $885.6 million for 2007. Conditions for workers compensation, contractors and public entity business have gotten increasingly competitive, which has reduced the volume of business that meets our underwriting and pricing criteria. A little less than half of the shortfall compared to last year was from the C.V. Starr program, where we have lost public entity accounts because we did not match market pricing and terms. In addition, the $76.3 million of gross written premium we assumed on a new program in 2007 did not recur in 2008. Net written premiums decreased by 17.1% to $617.0 million for 2008 compared to $744.3 million for 2007. The decrease in net written premiums was larger than the decline in gross written premiums primarily due to increased reinsurance cessions. Net premiums earned decreased 4.1% to $705.5 million for 2008 from $735.9 million for 2007. The lesser reduction in net premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are reflected at the initiation of the coverage period. Gross written premiums increased by 2.2% to $885.6 million for 2007 from $866.3 million for 2006. The increase is primarily the result of a new program we assumed late in 2007 with approximately $76 million of gross written premium. Absent this new program, gross written premiums would have decreased due to the further decline in our workers compensation and contractors liability writings in response to increased competition. Net written premiums decreased by 1.2% to $744.3 million for 2007 compared to $753.3 million for 2006 as our retention level fell slightly. Net premiums earned decreased 3.4% to $735.9 million for 2007 from $761.7 million for 2006, in line with the decrease in net written premiums. 59 Incurred Losses and LAE. The following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the U.S. Insurance segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Current Ratio %/ Prior Ratio %/ Total Ratio %/ (Dollars in millions) Year Pt Change Years Pt Change Incurred Pt Change 2008 Attritional $ 481.0 68.2% $ 69.1 9.8% $ 550.1 78.0% Catastrophes - 0.0% (0.3) 0.0% (0.3) 0.0% Total segment $ 481.0 68.2% $ 68.8 9.8% $ 549.9 77.9% 2007 Attritional $ 518.5 70.5% $ 38.3 5.2% $ 556.8 75.7% Catastrophes - 0.0% (0.4) -0.1% (0.4) -0.1% Total segment $ 518.5 70.5% $ 37.9 5.1% $ 556.4 75.6% 2006 Attritional $ 588.0 77.2% $ (68.5) -9.0% $ 519.5 68.2% Catastrophes - 0.0% 0.4 0.1% 0.4 0.1% Total segment $ 588.0 77.2% $ (68.1) -8.9% $ 519.9 68.3% Variance 2008/2007 Attritional $ (37.5) (2.3) pts $ 30.8 4.6 pts $ (6.7) 2.3 pts Catastrophes - - pts 0.2 0.0 pts 0.2 0.0 pts Total segment $ (37.5) (2.3) pts $ 31.0 4.7 pts $ (6.5) 2.3 pts Variance 2007/2006 Attritional $ (69.5) (6.8) pts $ 106.8 14.2 pts $ 37.3 7.5 pts Catastrophes - - pts (0.8) (0.1) pts (0.8) (0.1) pts Total segment $ (69.5) (6.7) pts $ 106.0 14.0 pts $ 36.5 7.3 pts (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Incurred losses and LAE decreased by 1.2% to $549.9 million for 2008 from $556.4 million for 2007 driven by the 4.1% decrease in net earned premium and a 2.3 point reduction in the current year loss ratio. In 2008, we strengthened reserves for an auto loan credit insurance program by $85.3 million as the deterioration in general economic conditions adversely impacted loan performance resulting in unforeseen increases in loan default rates and claim amounts. We had strengthened the reserves for this program by $64.7 million in 2007. We commuted our remaining liability on this program with the largest policyholder representing approximately one third of the remaining loss exposure. Given the magnitude of our current reserves, the maturity of the remaining insured portfolio and the reduced principal exposure, we believe future loss development, if any, related to this program will not be material. Other than as related to this run-off program, the segment experienced favorable reserve development in both 2008 and 2007. Incurred losses and LAE increased by 7.0% to $556.4 million for 2007 from $519.9 million for 2006 as the segment loss ratio increased by 7.3 points to 75.6%. From a ratio perspective, the swing in prior years development from favorable in 2006 to adverse in 2007 resulted in 14.0 points of increase. The adverse development in 2007 was the result of $64.7 million of adverse reserve run-off on a canceled auto loan credit insurance program, partially offset by favorable development on the remainder of the reserves. The 2007 accident year loss ratio was 70.5% which was 6.7 points lower than 2006. The 2006 accident year loss ratio was negatively impacted by the auto loan credit insurance program discussed above. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage increased by 7.7% to $146.7 million for 2008 from $136.2 million in 2007, principally due to higher commissions on two new programs. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2008 increased to $64.3 million as compared to $58.2 million for 2007, primarily due to increased compensation costs associated with increased staff. 60 Commission and brokerage increased by 10.7% to $136.2 million for 2007 from $123.1 million in 2006, principally due to an increase in regular commission on new programs and higher profit commissions. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to $58.2 million as compared to $48.9 million for 2006 due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. Specialty Underwriting. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Specialty Underwriting segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Variance % Change Variance % Change Gross written premiums $ 260.4 $ 270.1 $ 251.2 $ (9.7) -3.6% $ 18.9 7.5% Net written premiums 254.2 263.8 243.8 (9.6) -3.6% 20.0 8.2% Premiums earned $ 251.8 $ 262.0 $ 244.5 $ (10.2) -3.9% $ 17.5 7.1% Incurred losses and LAE 165.9 173.3 163.9 (7.4) -4.3% 9.3 5.7% Commission and brokerage 70.8 68.5 67.8 2.3 3.4% 0.7 1.0% Other underwriting expenses 8.1 8.5 6.6 (0.4) -4.8% 1.9 29.0% Underwriting gain $ 7.0 $ 11.7 $ 6.2 $ (4.7) -40.0% $ 5.5 89.3% Point Chg Point Chg Loss ratio 65.9% 66.1% 67.0% (0.2) (0.9) Commission and brokerage ratio 28.1% 26.2% 27.8% 1.9 (1.6) Other underwriting expense ratio 3.2% 3.2% 2.7% - 0.5 Combined ratio 97.2% 95.5% 97.5% 1.7 (2.0) (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by 3.6% to $260.4 million for 2008 from $270.1 million for 2007. Aviation premiums were lower by $16.9 million (58.9%) owing to very competitive market conditions. A&H premiums were lower by $15.4 million (16.1%) largely due to lower premiums under certain quota share contracts where the ceding companies have culled their books to improve their loss experience. Marine premiums were up by $19.8 million (19.8%) due to higher premiums on our quota share covers and improved rates across the book. Surety premiums were up $2.8 million or 6.1%. Net written premiums decreased 3.6% to $254.2 million for 2008 compared to $263.8 million for 2007, as a result of the decrease in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned decreased 3.9% to $251.8 million for 2008 compared to $262.0 million for 2007, in line with the change in net written premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 7.5% to $270.1 million for 2007 from $251.2 million for 2006, primarily due to a $36.9 million (58.7%) increase in marine premiums and a $12.2 million (14.7%) increase in A&H premiums, partially offset by a $24.6 million (34.9%) decrease in surety premiums and a $5.7 million (16.5%) decrease in aviation premiums. The increased marine premium growth emanated from growth in existing quota share business as well as new quota share contracts. We continued to decrease our aviation and surety writings, in response to more competitive market conditions. Net written premiums increased 8.2% to $263.8 million for 2007 compared to $243.8 million for 2006, as a result of the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased 7.1% to $262.0 million for 2007 compared to $244.5 million for 2006, in line with the growth in net written premiums. 61 Incurred Losses and LAE. The following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the Specialty Underwriting segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Current Ratio %/ Prior Ratio %/ Total Ratio %/ (Dollars in millions) Year Pt Change Years Pt Change Incurred Pt Change 2008 Attritional $ 150.8 59.9% $ (7.5) -3.0% $ 143.3 56.9% Catastrophes 17.5 7.0% 5.1 2.0% 22.6 9.0% Total segment $ 168.3 66.9% $ (2.5) -1.0% $ 165.9 65.9% 2007 Attritional $ 146.2 55.8% $ 3.3 1.2% $ 149.4 57.0% Catastrophes 0.4 0.2% 23.5 9.0% 23.9 9.1% Total segment $ 146.6 55.9% $ 26.7 10.2% $ 173.3 66.1% 2006 Attritional $ 141.2 57.7% $ (38.2) -15.6% $ 103.0 42.1% Catastrophes - 0.0% 60.9 24.9% 60.9 24.9% Total segment $ 141.2 57.7% $ 22.7 9.3% $ 163.9 67.0% Variance 2008/2007 Attritional $ 4.7 4.1 pts $ (10.8) (4.2) pts $ (6.1) (0.1) pts Catastrophes 17.1 6.8 pts (18.4) (6.9) pts (1.3) (0.1) pts Total segment $ 21.8 11.0 pts $ (29.2) (11.2) pts $ (7.4) (0.2) pts Variance 2007/2006 Attritional $ 5.0 (2.0) pts $ 41.4 16.9 pts $ 46.4 14.9 pts Catastrophes 0.4 0.2 pts (37.5) (16.0) pts (37.1) (15.8) pts Total segment $ 5.4 (1.8) pts $ 4.0 0.9 pts $ 9.3 (0.9) pts (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Incurred losses and LAE decreased to $165.9 million for 2008 compared to $173.3 million for 2007, as both attritional losses and catastrophe losses were similar for the two periods. The bulk of the 2008 catastrophe losses emanated from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, while the 2007 losses were primarily caused by late reported marine losses from Hurricane Rita. Incurred losses and LAE increased 5.7% to $173.3 million for 2007 compared to $163.9 million for 2006, generally proportional to the increase in net earned premiums. The loss ratio for the current accident year was slightly lower in 2007 compared to 2006. We experienced 10.2 points of adverse development in 2007 compared to 9.3 points in 2006. Catastrophe loss development, principally within the marine business related to Hurricane Katrina, was the principal driver of the overall development in both 2007 and 2006. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage increased 3.4% to $70.8 million in 2008 from $68.5 million in 2007 due primarily to the combined impacts of an increase in proportional premiums written, which generate higher ceding commissions, on the marine business and an increase in contingent commission on the aviation business. Segment other underwriting expenses decreased slightly to $8.1 million for 2008 from $8.5 million for 2008. Commission and brokerage increased 1.0% to $68.5 million in 2007 from $67.8 million in 2006 due primarily to premium growth. Segment other underwriting expenses increased 29.0% to $8.5 million for 2007 from $6.6 million for 2006, primarily due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. 62 International. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the International segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Variance % Change Variance % Change Gross written premiums $ 904.7 $ 805.9 $ 731.7 $ 98.8 12.3% $ 74.1 10.1% Net written premiums 902.1 806.0 730.7 96.2 11.9% 75.3 10.3% Premiums earned $ 885.5 $ 803.8 $ 719.5 $ 81.6 10.2% $ 84.4 11.7% Incurred losses and LAE 504.8 501.9 382.8 2.9 0.6% 119.1 31.1% Commission and brokerage 230.9 199.5 180.5 31.5 15.8% 18.9 10.5% Other underwriting expenses 19.8 18.6 13.8 1.1 6.2% 4.8 34.7% Underwriting gain $ 129.9 $ 83.8 $ 142.3 $ 46.1 55.0% $ (58.4) -41.1% Point Chg Point Chg Loss ratio 57.0% 62.4% 53.2% (5.4) 9.2 Commission and brokerage ratio 26.1% 24.8% 25.1% 1.3 (0.3) Other underwriting expense ratio 2.2% 2.4% 1.9% (0.2) 0.5 Combined ratio 85.3% 89.6% 80.2% (4.3) 9.4 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 12.3% to $904.7 million for 2008 from $805.9 million for 2007. Due, in part, to our strong financial strength ratings, we obtained increased participations on treaties in most regions over the course of the past twelve months. As well, we benefited from new business writings as some insurers sought to increase the financial strength ratings of their reinsurance panels. In addition, we obtained some preferential signings including preferential terms and conditions, and benefited from higher rates in some markets. Premiums written through the Miami and New Jersey offices increased by $106.0 million (22.5%); the Asian branch increased by $24.2 million (14.6%), while premiums for the Canadian branch decreased by $31.8 million (18.7%). Net written premiums increased by 11.9% to $902.1 million for 2008 compared to $806.0 million for 2007, principally as a result of the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased 10.2% to $885.5 million for 2008 compared to $803.8 million for 2007, generally consistent with the increase in net written premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 10.1% to $805.9 million for 2007 from $731.7 million for 2006. Approximately half of this increase was attributable to the impact of other currencies strengthening against the U.S. dollar. We wrote reinsurance contracts in multiple currencies and as these currencies strengthened and were converted to U.S. dollars for financial reporting, they converted to higher dollar values. Business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices increased by $35.0 million (8.0%), business written through the Asian branch increased by $22.3 million (15.6%) and business written through the Canadian branch increased by $17.9 million (11.8%). We have experienced strong fundamental growth in geographic areas where economic growth and demand for reinsurance is strong. Net written premiums increased by 10.3% to $806.0 million for 2007 compared to $730.7 million for 2006, principally as a result of the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased 11.7% to $803.8 million for 2007 compared to $719.5 million for 2006, consistent with the increase in net written premiums. 63 Incurred Losses and LAE. The following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the International segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, Current Ratio %/ Prior Ratio %/ Total Ratio %/ (Dollars in millions) Year Pt Change Years Pt Change Incurred Pt Change 2008 Attritional $ 501.4 56.6% $ (33.5) -3.8% $ 467.9 52.8% Catastrophes 43.5 4.9% (6.7) -0.8% 36.9 4.2% Total segment $ 544.9 61.5% $ (40.1) -4.5% $ 504.8 57.0% 2007 Attritional $ 435.6 54.2% $ (10.9) -1.4% $ 424.7 52.8% Catastrophes 75.4 9.4% 1.8 0.2% 77.2 9.6% Total segment $ 511.0 63.6% $ (9.1) -1.1% $ 501.9 62.4% 2006 Attritional $ 389.3 54.1% $ (31.7) -4.4% $ 357.5 49.7% Catastrophes 6.7 0.9% 18.6 2.6% 25.3 3.5% Total segment $ 396.0 55.0% $ (13.1) -1.8% $ 382.8 53.2% Variance 2008/2007 Attritional $ 65.8 2.4 pts $ (22.5) (2.4) pts $ 43.3 0.0 pts Catastrophes (31.9) (4.5) pts (8.4) (1.0) pts (40.4) (5.5) pts Total segment $ 33.9 (2.1) pts $ (31.0) (3.4) pts $ 2.9 (5.4) pts Variance 2007/2006 Attritional $ 46.3 0.1 pts $ 20.8 3.1 pts $ 67.1 3.1 pts Catastrophes 68.8 8.5 pts (16.8) (2.4) pts 51.9 6.1 pts Total segment $ 115.1 8.6 pts $ 4.0 0.7 pts $ 119.1 9.2 pts (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Incurred losses and LAE increased slightly to $504.8 million for 2008 compared to $501.9 million for 2007. The segment loss ratio decreased by 5.4 points for 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower current year catastrophe losses in 2008 compared to 2007. The 2008 current year catastrophe losses included a large snowstorm in China and Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. In addition, increased favorable development on prior years reserves period over period contributed to the lower loss ratio. Incurred losses and LAE increased by 31.1% to $501.9 million for 2007 compared to $382.8 million for 2006. The segment loss ratio increased by 9.2 points, principally due to an increase in the catastrophe loss ratio by 6.1 points. In 2007, catastrophe losses included Tabasco, Mexico floods, New South Wales storm, Peruvian earthquake, Hurricane Dean, and Jakarta flood. In addition, the reduction in favorable reserve development, year over year, accounted for the increase in the segment loss ratio in 2007 compared to 2006. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage increased 15.8% to $230.9 million for 2008 from $199.5 million in 2007. The increase was principally due to the growth in premiums earned. In addition, the commission and brokerage ratio increased largely due to increased contingent commissions emanating from the profitable results. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2008 increased to $19.8 million compared to $18.6 million for 2007. Commission and brokerage increased 10.5% to $199.5 million for 2007 from $180.5 million in 2006, consistent with the increase in premiums. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to $18.6 million compared to $13.8 million for 2006, primarily due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. 64 Bermuda. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Bermuda segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2008/2007 2007/2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Variance % Change Variance % Change Gross written premiums $ 783.4 $ 922.5 $ 814.9 $ (139.1) -15.1% $ 107.6 13.2% Net written premiums 783.1 922.3 816.2 (139.2) -15.1% 106.1 13.0% Premiums earned $ 801.2 $ 912.9 $ 846.4 $ (111.7) -12.2% $ 66.4 7.9% Incurred losses and LAE 420.3 611.2 516.6 (190.9) -31.2% 94.6 18.3% Commission and brokerage 208.9 230.4 213.7 (21.5) -9.3% 16.7 7.8% Other underwriting expenses 24.2 20.9 17.2 3.3 15.6% 3.7 21.7% Underwriting gain $ 147.8 $ 50.4 $ 99.0 $ 97.5 193.4% $ (48.6) -49.1% Point Chg Point Chg Loss ratio 52.5% 67.0% 61.0% (14.5) 6.0 Commission and brokerage ratio 26.1% 25.2% 25.3% 0.9 (0.1) Other underwriting expense ratio 2.9% 2.3% 2.0% 0.6 0.3 Combined ratio 81.5% 94.5% 88.3% (13.0) 6.2 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased 15.1% to $783.4 million for 2008 compared to $922.5 million for 2007. The Bermuda home office premiums were down for 2008 compared to 2007 by $69.7 million, principally due to a discontinued account and conversion of a large casualty quota share to excess of loss coverage. The U.K. branch premiums were down $69.1 million due to the non-renewal of two casualty proportional contracts. Net written premiums decreased 15.1% to $783.1 million for 2008 compared to $922.3 million for 2007 and net premiums earned decreased 12.2% to $801.2 million for 2008 compared to $912.9 million for 2007, commensurate with the decrease in gross written premiums. Gross written premiums increased 13.2% to $922.5 million for 2007 compared to $814.9 million for 2006. Premiums written from the Bermuda office increased $61.0 million and premiums written from the UK office increased $47.3 million. The increase in the Bermuda office premiums was driven by growth in worldwide treaty casualty reinsurance business and approximately half of the increase from the UK office was driven by the Pound Sterling currency strengthening against the U.S. dollar during 2007. Net written premiums increased 13.0% to $922.3 million for 2007 compared to $816.2 million for 2006, commensurate with the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased 7.9% to $912.9 million for 2007 compared to $846.4 million for 2006. The change in net premiums earned relative to the net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are reflected at the initiation of the coverage period. 65 Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred losses and LAE decreased 31.2% to $420.3 million for 2008 compared to $611.2 million for 2007. The principal driver of the decrease was the absence of development on A&E loss reserves in 2008, which reduced the segment loss ratio by 13.3 points. Incurred losses and LAE increased 18.3% to $611.2 million for 2007 compared to $516.6 million for 2006. The segment loss ratio for Bermuda increased 6.0 points, reflecting a 5.8 point increase in catastrophe losses and a 3.9 point increase for A&E losses, partially offset by a 3.8 point decrease for attritional losses. The current year catastrophe losses include winter storm Kyrill and the June and July, 2007 London floods. The increase in A&E losses was due to the strengthening of asbestos reserves, principally for the direct business. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage decreased 9.3% to $208.9 million for 2008 from $230.4 million for 2007, principally the result of a decline in premiums earned and the change in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2008 increased to $24.2 million compared to $20.9 million for 2007, primarily due to a general increase in operations to support the business. Commission and brokerage increased 7.8% to $230.4 million for 2007 from $213.7 million for 2006, principally due to the increase in premiums earned. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to $20.9 million compared to $17.2 million for 2006, primarily due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. 66 Critical Accounting Policies The following is a summary of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions. Loss and LAE Reserves. Our most critical accounting policy is the determination of our loss and LAE reserves. We maintain reserves equal to our estimated ultimate liability for losses and LAE for reported and unreported claims for our insurance and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and LAE by underwriting or accident year, we use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time, evaluate new information as it becomes known and adjust reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted. We consider many factors when setting reserves including: (1) our exposure base and projected ultimate premiums earned; (2) our expected loss ratios by product and class of business, which are developed collaboratively by underwriters and actuaries; (3) actuarial methodologies which analyze our loss reporting and payment experience, reports from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6) uncertainties discussed below regarding our liability for A&E claims. Our insurance and reinsurance loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves. Our net income will be impacted in a period in which the change in estimated ultimate losses and LAE is recorded. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is more difficult to accurately estimate loss reserves for reinsurance liabilities than for insurance liabilities. At December 31, 2008 we had reinsurance reserves of $6,626.4 million and insurance loss reserves of $2,214.3 million, of which $533.2 million and $200.9 million, respectively, were loss reserves for A&E liabilities. A detailed discussion of additional considerations related to A&E exposures follows later in this section. The detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for our insurance business is accumulated from our underwriting and claim systems. Reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies. Ceding companies report losses to us in many forms dependent on the type of contract and the agreed or contractual reporting requirements. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company. This information is recorded into our records. For certain proportional contracts, we may require a detailed loss report for claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss. Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices provided when a loss reaches a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur. Our experienced claims staff handles individual loss reports and supporting claim information. Based on our evaluation of a claim, we may establish additional case reserves (ACRs) in addition to the case reserves reported by the ceding company. To ensure ceding companies are submitting required and accurate data, the Underwriting, Claim, Reinsurance Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform various reviews of our ceding companies, particularly larger ceding companies, including on-site audits. We sort both our reinsurance and insurance reserves into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis. We assign our business to exposure groupings so that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to facilitate credible estimation of ultimate losses. We periodically review our exposure groupings and we may change our grouping over time as our business changes. We currently use over 200 exposure groupings to develop our reserve estimates. One of the key selection characteristics for the exposure groupings is the historical duration of the claims settlement process. Business in which claims are reported and settled relatively quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines, principally property lines. On the other hand, casualty claims tend to take longer to be reported and settled and casualty lines are generally referred to as long tail lines. Our estimates of ultimate 67 losses for shorter tail lines, with the exception of loss estimates for large catastrophic events, generally exhibit less volatility than those for the longer tail lines. We use similar actuarial methodologies, such as expected loss ratio, chain ladder reserving methods and Borhuetter Ferguson, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, to estimate our ultimate losses and LAE for each exposure group. Although we use similar actuarial methodologies for both short tail and long tail lines, the faster reporting of experience for the short tail lines allows us to have greater confidence in our estimates of ultimate losses for short tail lines at an earlier stage than for long tail lines. As a result, we utilize, as well, exposure-based methods to estimate our ultimate losses for longer tail lines, especially for immature accident years. For both short and long tail lines, we supplement these general approaches with analytically based judgments. We cannot estimate losses from widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, using traditional actuarial methods. We estimate losses for these types of events based on information derived from catastrophe models, quantitative and qualitative exposure analyses, reports and communications from ceding companies and development patterns for historically similar events. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses, these estimates are subject to variability, which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying event. Our key actuarial assumptions contain no explicit provisions for reserve uncertainty nor do we supplement the actuarially determined reserves for uncertainty. Our carried reserves at each reporting date are our best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and LAE at that date. We complete detailed reserve studies for each exposure group annually for our reinsurance operations and quarterly for our insurance operations. The completed annual reinsurance reserve studies are rolled forward for each accounting period until the subsequent reserve study is completed. The roll-forward process involves comparing actual reported losses to expected losses based on the most recent reserve study. We analyze significant variances between actual and expected losses and post adjustments to our reserves as warranted. Given the inherent variability in our loss reserves, we have developed an estimated range of possible gross reserve levels. A table of ranges by segment, accompanied by commentary on potential and historical variability, is included in Financial Condition - Loss and LAE Reserves . The ranges are statistically developed using the exposure groups used in the reserve estimation process and aggregated to the segment level. For each exposure group, our actuaries calculate a range for each accident year based principally on two variables. The first is the historical changes in losses and LAE incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) for each accident year over time; the second is volatility of each accident year held reserves related to estimated ultimate losses, also over time. Both are measured at various ages from the end of the accident year through the final payout of the year losses. Ranges are developed for the exposure groups using statistical methods to adjust for diversification; the ranges for the exposure groups are aggregated to the segment level, likewise, with an adjustment for diversification. Our estimates of our reserve variability may not be comparable to those of other companies because there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. Our recorded reserves reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities and our actuarial methodologies focus on developing such point estimates. We calculate the ranges subsequently, based on the historical variability of such reserves. Asbestos and Environmental Exposures. We continue to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts, asserting injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. Environmental claims typically assert liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water. Asbestos claims typically assert liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos. 68 Our reserves include an estimate of our ultimate liability for A&E claims. Our A&E liabilities emanate from Mt. McKinley direct insurance business and Everest Re assumed reinsurance business. There are significant uncertainties surrounding our estimates of our potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure. With respect to asbestos claims in particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound the difficulty in estimating our liability. These developments include: (a) a changing mix of claim types represented in new filings, with the relative percentage of claims by individuals with no functional impairment first increasing then decreasing over the past several years; (b) the growth in the number of claims where coverage is sought under the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion; (c) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants, especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (d) the slow development of asbestos bankruptcy cases, as a result of which many of the critical legal issues arising in those cases are still unresolved at the appellate level; (e) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses; (f) legislation in some states to address asbestos litigation issues; and (g) the potential that other states or the U.S. Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that new claims filing rates have decreased, that new filings of asbestos-driven bankruptcies have decreased and that various procedural and legislative reforms are beginning to diminish the potential ultimate liability for asbestos losses. We believe that these uncertainties continue to render reserves for A&E, and particularly asbestos losses, significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves for other types of losses. We establish reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for us or our ceding companies. We have direct relationships with Mt. McKinley policyholders and we attempt to uphold our contractual rights and assert valid defenses to coverage where appropriate. The uncertainties inherent in asbestos coverage and bankruptcy litigations have provided us the opportunity to engage in settlement negotiations with a number of policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities. Those discussions are aimed at achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that limit Mt. McKinley liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. Because of the risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, we cannot be certain that this approach will lead to a negotiated settlement in the range expected by us in each or every instance. Between 2004 and 2008, we concluded settlements or reached agreement in principle with 19 of our high profile policyholders. We continue the approach of attempting to negotiate with such policyholders that may have significant asbestos liabilities, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where we and the policyholder have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. We believe that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective liquidation of Mt. McKinley liabilities than a passive approach, although it may also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley losses and cash flows as reserves are adjusted to reflect the developments in litigation, negotiations and, ultimately, potential settlements. There is little potential for similar settlements of our reinsurance asbestos claims where we have no direct relationships with the insureds. Our ceding companies have the direct obligation to insureds and are responsible for their own claim settlements. They are not consistently prompt in developing and providing claim settlement information to their reinsurers, which can introduce inconsistencies and significant delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers, including us. These delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but also limit the available information from which reinsurers, including us, estimate their ultimate exposure. See the discussion below under the heading Financial Condition Loss and LAE Reserves . 69 Due to the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and particularly asbestos, may be subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and such variation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Reinsurance Receivables. We have purchased reinsurance to reduce our exposure to adverse claim experience, large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. Our ceded reinsurance provides for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances. Such reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders. In the event our reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under these agreements or are able to successfully challenge losses ceded by us under the contracts, we will not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance receivable balance. To minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables, we have a reinsurance security committee that evaluates the financial strength of each reinsurer prior to our entering into a reinsurance arrangement. In some cases, we may hold full or partial collateral for the receivable, including letters of credit, trust assets and cash. Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S. are generally required to secure their obligations. We have established reserves for uncollectible balances based on our assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the reserve for uncollectible balances was $247.9 million and $173.0 million, respectively. Actual uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Condition Reinsurance Receivables below. Premiums Written and Earned. Premiums written by us are earned ratably over the coverage periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts. We establish unearned premium reserves to cover the unexpired portion of each contract. Such reserves are computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data received from ceding companies. Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to us, are estimated and accrued. Because of the inherent lag in the reporting of written and earned premiums by our ceding companies, we use standard accepted actuarial methodologies to estimate earned but not reported premium at each financial reporting date. These earned but not reported premiums are combined with reported earned premiums to comprise our total premiums earned for determination of our incurred losses and loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and incurred losses related to the change in earned but not reported premium are included in current period company and segment financial results. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table displays the estimated components of earned but not reported premiums by segment for the periods indicated: At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 U.S. Reinsurance $ 289.2 $ 405.3 $ 426.2 U.S. Insurance 13.9 13.7 16.5 Specialty Underwriting 82.2 82.8 85.2 International 181.0 178.5 199.9 Bermuda 185.1 202.2 160.6 Total $ 751.3 $ 882.5 $ 888.4 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Investment Valuation. Our fixed income investments are classified for accounting purposes as available for sale and are carried at market value or fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Our equity securities are also held as available for sale and are carried at market or fair value. Most securities we own are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. Some of our commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) are valued using cash flow models and risk-adjusted discount rates. We hold some 70 privately placed securities, less than 0.5% of the portfolio, that are either valued by brokers or an investment advisor. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our investment portfolio included $644.8 million and $623.6 million, respectively, of limited partnership investments whose values are reported pursuant to the equity method of accounting. We carry these investments at values provided by the managements of the limited partnerships and due to inherent reporting lags, the carrying values are based on values with as of dates from one month to one quarter prior to our financial statement date. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had net unrealized losses, net of tax, of $163.4 million and net unrealized gains, net of tax, of $73.2 million, respectively. Gains and losses from market fluctuations for investments held at market value are reflected as comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses from market fluctuations for investments held at fair value are reflected as net realized capital gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with the provisions of FAS 159. Market value declines for the fixed income portfolio, which are considered other-than-temporary impairments are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), as realized capital losses. We consider many factors when determining whether a market value decline is other-than-temporary, including: (1) our ability and intent to hold the security, (2) the length of time the market value has been below book value, (3) the credit strength of the issuer, (4) the issuer market sector, (5) the length of time to maturity and (6) for asset-backed securities, increases in prepayments, credit enhancements and underlying default rates. If management assessments change in the future, we may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash and Invested Assets. Aggregate invested assets, including cash and short-term investments, were $13,714.3 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $1,221.9 million, compared to $14,936.2 million at December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of $657.6 million in foreign exchange losses on our portfolio securities and cash, $310.4 million of unrealized depreciation, a $276.0 million decline due to fair value adjustments, $243.3 million of net realized capital losses on sales, $176.5 million of other-than-temporary impairments, repurchases of 1.6 million of our common shares for $150.7 million and $118.6 million paid out in dividends to shareholders, partially offset by $663.0 million of cash flows from operations. Our principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, we view our investment portfolio as having two components: 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by our shareholders equity. For the portion needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities, we invest in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa2, as rated by Moody s. Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market conditions and our tax position. This fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by us. Over the past few years, we had reallocated our equity investment portfolio to include: 1) publicly traded equity securities and 2) private equity limited partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification was to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes. We had limited our allocation to these asset classes because of 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. As a result of the dramatic slowdown in the global economy and the liquidity crisis affecting the financial markets, we significantly reduced our exposure to public equities during the fourth quarter of 2008 and correspondingly increased our holdings in short-term investments during the fourth quarter. At December 31, 2008, the market or fair value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities approximated 16% of shareholders equity, a decrease of 22 points from the 38% of shareholders equity at December 31, 2007. 71 The tables below summarize the composition and characteristics of our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated: December 31, 2008 2007 Fixed maturities, market value 78.5% 68.6% Fixed maturities, fair value 0.3% 0.0% Equity securities - market value 0.1% 0.1% Equity securities - fair value 0.9% 10.3% Short-term investments 13.8% 14.9% Other invested assets 4.9% 4.4% Cash 1.5% 1.7% Total investments and cash 100.0% 100.0% December 31, 2008 2007 Fixed income portfolio duration (years) 4.1 3.9 Fixed income composite credit quality Aa2 Aa2 Imbedded end of period yield, pre-tax 4.5% 4.7% Imbedded end of period yield, after-tax 4.0% 3.9% The following table provides a comparison of our total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the periods indicated: 2008 2007 2006 Fixed income portfolio total return 0.3% 5.0% 4.6% Lehman bond aggregate index 5.2% 7.0% 4.3% Common equity portfolio total return -40.9% 9.2% 19.2% S & P 500 index -37.0% 5.5% 15.8% Other invested asset portfolio total return -7.4% 13.5% 19.8% The pre-tax equivalent total return for the bond portfolio was approximately 2.1%, 5.7% and 5.3%, respectively, for 2008, 2007 and 2006. The pre-tax equivalent return adjusts the yield on tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent. Reinsurance Receivables. Reinsurance receivables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $657.2 million at December 31, 2008 and $666.2 million at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, $185.4 million, or 28.2%, was receivable from Transatlantic; $100.0 million, or 15.2%, was receivable from Continental; $57.0 million, or 8.7%, was receivable from Munich Re; $39.6 million, or 6.0%, was receivable from Ace; $36.9 million, or 5.6%, was receivable from Berkley and $33.8 million or 5.1% was receivable from C.V. Starr. The receivable from Continental is collateralized by a funds held arrangement under which we have retained the premiums earned by the retrocessionaire to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire, recorded them as a liability, credited interest on the balances at a stated contractual rate and reduced the liability account as payments become due. In addition, $227.3 million was receivable from Founders, for which the Company has recorded a full provision for uncollectibility. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of our receivables. 72 Loss and LAE Reserves. Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled $8,840.7 million at December 31, 2008 and $9,040.6 million at December 31, 2007. The following tables summarize gross outstanding loss and LAE reserves by segment, classified by case reserves and IBNR reserves, for the periods indicated: Gross Reserves By Segment At December 31, 2008 Case IBNR Total % of (Dollars in millions) Reserves Reserves Reserves Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,384.7 $ 1,884.1 $ 3,268.8 37.0% U.S. Insurance 589.1 1,217.8 1,806.9 20.4% Specialty Underwriting 260.8 163.4 424.2 4.8% International 664.3 427.3 1,091.6 12.3% Bermuda 634.9 827.4 1,462.3 16.5% Total excluding A&E 3,533.7 4,520.1 8,053.8 91.1% A&E 434.5 352.3 786.8 8.9% Total including A&E $ 3,968.2 $ 4,872.4 $ 8,840.7 100.0% (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)

Changes in earned premiums and business mix, reserve re-estimations, catastrophe losses and changes in catastrophe loss reserves and claim settlement activity all impact loss and LAE reserves by segment and in total. Our loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We continuously re-evaluate our reserves, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. Changes in reserves resulting from such re-evaluations are reflected in incurred losses in the period when the re-evaluation is made. Our analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. In order to set appropriate reserves, we make qualitative and quantitative analyses and judgments at these various levels. Additionally, the attribution of reserves, changes in reserves and incurred losses among accident years requires qualitative and quantitative adjustments and allocations at these various levels. We utilize actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to assure the accuracy and consistency of our reserving practices. Nevertheless, our reserves are estimates, which are subject to variation, which may be significant. 73 There can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future, possibly by a material amount. However, we believe that our existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In this context, we note that over the past 10 years, our calendar year operations have been affected by effects from prior period reserve re-estimates, ranging from a favorable $26.4 million in 2005, representing 0.5% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made, to an unfavorable $249.4 million in 2004, representing 3.7% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made. We have included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by our actuaries, which have been developed through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. Our presentation of this information may not be directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. Our recorded reserves are an aggregation of our best point estimates for approximately 200 reserve groups and reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities. Our actuarial methodologies develop point estimates rather than ranges and the ranges are developed subsequently based upon historical and prospective variability measures. The following table below represents the reserve levels and ranges for each of our business segments for the period indicated: Outstanding Reserves and Ranges By Segment (1) At December 31, 2008 As Low Low High High (Dollars in millions) Reported Range % (2) Range (2) Range % (2) Range (2) Gross Reserves By Segment U.S. Reinsurance $ 3,268.8 -14.3% $ 2,802.2 14.3% $ 3,735.3 U.S. Insurance 1,806.9 -20.9% 1,430.1 20.9% 2,183.7 Specialty Underwriting 424.2 -16.2% 355.3 16.2% 493.1 International 1,091.6 -10.8% 973.5 10.8% 1,209.8 Bermuda 1,462.3 -8.0% 1,344.8 8.0% 1,579.9 Total Gross Reserves (excluding A&E) 8,053.8 -10.6% 7,196.8 10.6% 8,910.9 A&E (All Segments) 786.8 -13.7% 679.0 13.7% 894.6 Total Gross Reserves $ 8,840.7 -10.3% 7,927.4 10.3% 9,754.0 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) _______________ (1) There can be no assurance that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated ranges requiring additional income statement expense. (2) Although totals are displayed for both the low and high range amounts, because of the statistical methods employed, the range of the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments. Depending on the specific segment, the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges from minus 8.0% to minus 20.9% for the low range and from plus 8.0% to plus 20.9% for the high range. Both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the U.S. Insurance segment. The size of the range is dependent upon the level of confidence associated with the outcome. Within each range, our best estimate of loss reserves is based upon the point estimatederived by our actuaries in detailed reserve studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development. For the above presentation, we have assumed what we believe is a reasonable confidence level but note that there can be no assurance that our claim obligations will not vary outside of these ranges. Additional losses, including those relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by us or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not covered by existing 74 retrocessional contracts, could have material adverse effects on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have exposure to insured A&E losses through our Mt. McKinley operation and reinsured A&E losses and through Everest Re. In each case, our management and analyses of our exposures take into account a number of features of our business that differentiate our exposures from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures. Mt. McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and increased the volume of its writings in 1978. These writings ceased in 1984, giving Mt. McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure, which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s to have been issued without aggregate limits on the product liability coverage. Policies issued in earlier decades were generally more likely to lack aggregate limits. The vast majority of Mt. McKinley A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with aggregate coverage limits. Mt. McKinley attachment points vary but generally are excess of millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of most of Mt. McKinley policies also offers insulation against non-product claims (for example, claims arising under general liability coverage). Although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non-product claims, such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non-product claims are generally less likely to aggregate since each non-product claim is a separate loss; whereas for product claims, all claims related to a given product aggregate as one loss. Environmental claims arise under general liability coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies. Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures beginning in 1984 through contract exclusions. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many long established reinsurance companies. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re mainly wrote property business, which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re reinsured both primary and excess policies. However, its claim experience indicates that the majority of its exposure was on excess policies, similar to those directly written by Mt. McKinley. 75 Asbestos and Environmental Exposures. A&E exposures represent a separate exposure group for monitoring and evaluating reserve adequacy. The following table summarizes incurred losses and outstanding loss reserves with respect to A&E reserves on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for the periods indicated: At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 922.8 $ 650.1 $ 649.5 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 130.7 70.8 87.9 Change in IBNR (130.7) 334.2 25.5 Total incurred losses and LAE - 405.0 113.4 Paid losses (136.0) (132.3) (112.7) End of period reserves $ 786.8 $ 922.8 $ 650.1 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 827.4 $ 511.4 $ 450.4 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 120.0 69.9 81.6 Change in IBNR (120.0) 317.6 25.0 Total incurred losses and LAE - 387.5 106.6 Paid losses (78.3) (71.6) (45.5) End of period reserves $ 749.1 $ 827.4 $ 511.4 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) At December 31, 2008, the gross reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $161.0 million representing case reserves reported by ceding companies, $139.7 million representing additional case reserves established by us on assumed reinsurance claims, $133.8 million representing case reserves established by us on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt. McKinley, and $352.3 million representing IBNR reserves. With respect to asbestos only, at December 31, 2008, we had gross asbestos loss reserves of $734.1 million, or 93.3%, of total A&E reserves, of which $533.2 million was for assumed business and $200.9 million was for direct business. 76 The following tables summarize reserve and claim activity on a gross and net of ceded reinsurance basis for our reinsurance and direct asbestos exposures: Asbestos - Reinsurance At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 585.3 $ 320.5 $ 313.4 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 71.3 39.2 54.1 Change in IBNR (71.3) 265.8 (2.7) Total incurred losses and LAE - 305.0 51.4 Paid losses (52.2) (40.2) (44.3) End of period reserves $ 533.2 $ 585.3 $ 320.5 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 557.4 $ 302.0 $ 289.5 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 66.2 40.4 50.9 Change in IBNR (66.2) 255.6 3.6 Total incurred losses and LAE - 296.0 54.5 Paid losses (49.1) (40.6) (42.0) End of period reserves $ 508.2 $ 557.4 $ 302.0 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Asbestos - Direct At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 273.6 $ 260.5 $ 255.5 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 51.6 23.2 36.6 Change in IBNR (51.6) 76.8 25.4 Total incurred losses and LAE - 100.0 62.0 Paid losses (72.7) (86.9) (57.0) End of period reserves $ 200.9 $ 273.6 $ 260.5 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 205.9 $ 140.4 $ 75.8 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 46.6 21.8 33.8 Change in IBNR (46.6) 69.8 23.8 Total incurred losses and LAE - 91.6 57.6 Paid losses (18.6) (26.1) 7.0 End of period reserves $ 187.3 $ 205.9 $ 140.4 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) 77 Ultimate loss projections for A&E liabilities cannot be accomplished using standard actuarial techniques. In 2007, we completed a detailed study of our asbestos experience and our cedants asbestos exposures and also considered industry trends. Our Claims Department undertook a contract by contract analysis of our direct business and projected those findings to our assumed reinsurance business. Our actuaries utilized nine methodologies to project our potential ultimate liabilities including projections based on internal data and assessments, extrapolations of non-public and publicly available data for our cedants and benchmarking against industry data and experience. As a result of the study, we increased our gross reinsurance asbestos reserves by $250.0 million and our gross direct asbestos reserves by $75.0 million. Subsequent to the study, we have not experienced significant claims activity related to asbestos. We believe that our A&E reserves represent our best estimate of the ultimate liability, however, there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves, perhaps by a significant amount. No additional reserve strengthening was made in 2008. Industry analysts use the survival ratio to compare the A&E reserves among companies with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company current net reserves by the three year average of annual paid losses. Hence, the survival ratio equals the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves if future loss payments were to continue at historical levels. Using this measurement, our net three year asbestos survival ratio was 2.8 years for direct business and 11.6 years for reinsurance business at December 31, 2008. From a comparison perspective, A.M. Best published survival ratios as of December 31, 2007, the latest available information, of 8.2 years for the overall insurance industry and 13.6 years for the reinsurance sector. Because the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and does not indicate absolute reserve adequacy, we consider, but do not rely on, the survival ratio when evaluating our reserves. In particular, we note that year to year loss payment variability can be material. This is due, in part, to our orientation to negotiated settlements, particularly on our Mt. McKinley exposures, which significantly reduces the credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool. During 2008, we made asbestos net claim payments of $46.2 million to Mt McKinley high profile claimants where the claim was either closed or a settlement had been reached. Such payments, which are non-repetitive, distort downward our three year survival ratio for 2008 and will continue to do so for 2009 and 2010. Adjusting for such settlements, recognizing that total settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an agreed settlement, we consider that our adjusted asbestos survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 9.2 years, which is closer to prevailing industry norms. Shareholders Equity. Our shareholders equity decreased to $4,960.4 million as of December 31, 2008 from $5,684.8 million as of December 31, 2007. This decrease was the result of unrealized depreciation on investments, net of tax, of $236.6 million, $193.3 million of foreign currency translation adjustments, the repurchase of 1.6 million common shares for $150.7 million, $118.6 million of shareholder dividends and a net loss of $18.8 million, partially offset by $18.7 million of additional paid in capital on share-based compensation transactions. The Company shareholders equity increased to $5,684.8 million as of December 31, 2007 from $5,107.7 million as of December 31, 2006, principally due to $839.3 million of net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by the repurchase of 2.5 million common shares for $241.6 million and $121.4 million of shareholder dividends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Capital. Our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength and financial strength ratings, and the market perception of our financial strength, as measured by shareholders equity, which was $4,960.4 million and $5,684.8 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We possess significant financial flexibility and access to the debt and equity markets as a result of our perceived financial strength, as evidenced by the financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies. During the last six months of 2008, the capital markets have been illiquid in reaction to the deepening credit crisis which has led to bank and other financial institution failures and effective failures. Credit spreads have soared and the equity markets have declined significantly during this period making access to the capital 78 markets, for even highly rated companies, difficult and costly. Our capital position remains strong, commensurate with our financial ratings. We have ample liquidity to meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we have no foreseeable need to tap the capital markets in the near term. From time to time, we have used open market share repurchases to adjust our capital position and enhance long term expected returns to our shareholders. On July 21, 2008, our existing authorization to purchase up to 5 million of our shares was amended to authorize the purchase of up to 10 million shares. As of December 31, 2008, we had repurchased 4.2 million shares under this authorization. On December 17, 2008, we renewed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC, as a Well Known Seasoned Issuer. This shelf registration statement can be used by Group to register common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants, share purchase contracts and share purchase units; by Holdings to register debt securities and by Everest Re Capital Trust III ( Capital Trust III ) to register trust preferred securities. Liquidity. Our principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, we view our investment portfolio as having two components; 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by our shareholders equity. For the portion needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities, we invest in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa2, as rated by Moody s. Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market conditions and our tax position. This fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by us. Over the past few years, we had reallocated our equity portfolio to include 1) publicly traded equity securities and 2) private equity limited partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification was to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes. We had limited our allocation to these asset classes because of 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. As a result of the concomitant decline in equity values slowdown in the global economy and the liquidity crisis affecting the financial markets, we significantly reduced our exposure to public equities during the fourth quarter of 2008 and correspondingly increased our holdings in short-term investments during the fourth quarter. At December 31, 2008, the market or fair value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities approximated 16% of shareholders equity. Our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments. Our net cash flows from operating activities were $663.0 million, $854.4 million and $636.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows reflected net tax payments of $11.0 million, $282.6 million and $46.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively; net catastrophe loss payments of $290.5 million, $443.1 million and $896.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively; and net A&E payments of $78.3 million, $71.6 million and $45.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. If disbursements for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were to exceed premium inflows, cash flow from insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash flow from insurance operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash inflows from investment maturities and dispositions, both short-term investments and longer term maturities are available to supplement other operating cash flows. 79 As the timing of payments for claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, we maintain portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held cash and short-term investments of $2,095.5 million and $2,476.3 million, respectively. All of our short-term investments are readily marketable and can be converted to cash. In addition to these cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2008, we had $606.4 million of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $2,605.8 million maturing within one to five years and $5,669.0 million maturing after five years. Our $136.7 million of equity securities are comprised primarily of publicly traded securities that can be easily liquidated. We believe that these fixed maturity and equity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future. We do not anticipate selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but have the ability to do so. Sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses and at December 31, 2008 we had $178.4 million of net pre-tax unrealized depreciation, comprised of $612.1 million of pre-tax unrealized depreciation and $433.7 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation. Management expects annual positive cash flow from operations, which in general reflects the strength of overall pricing, to persist over the near term, absent any unusual catastrophe activity. In the intermediate and long term, our cash flow from operations will be impacted by the extent to which competitive pressures affect overall pricing in our markets and the extent to which our premium receipts are impacted by our strategy of emphasizing underwriting profitability over premium volume. Effective July 27, 2007, Group, Bermuda Re and Everest International entered into a new five year, $850.0 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 8, 2004, senior credit facilities, which would have expired on December 8, 2007. Both the July 27, 2007 and December 8, 2004 senior credit facilities are referred to as the Group Credit Facility . Wachovia Bank, a subsidiary of Wells Fargo Corporation ( Wachovia Bank ), is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility, which consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $350.0 million of unsecured revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of unsecured standby letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the Company option, be either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of (a) the prime commercial lending rate established by Wachovia Bank or (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depends on Group senior unsecured debt rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500.0 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis. The Group Credit Facility requires Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a minimum net worth. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of $3,575.4 million plus 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group fiscal quarters, for which statements are available ending on or after January 1, 2007 and for which consolidated net income is positive, plus 25% of any increase in consolidated net worth during such period attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares, which at December 31, 2008, was $3,856.5 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all Group Credit Facility covenants. At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding letters of credit under tranche one and $411.9 million issued under tranche two of the Group Credit Facility. At December 31, 2007, there were outstanding letters of credit of $22.0 million and $288.0 million under tranche one and tranche two of the Group Credit Facility, respectively. Effective August 23, 2006, Holdings entered into a five year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, referred to as the Holdings Credit Facility . Citibank N.A. is the administrative agent for the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility may be used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) a periodic fixed rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin. The Base Rate means a fluctuating interest rate per annum in effect from time to time to be equal to the higher of (a) the rate of interest publicly 80 announced by Citibank as its prime rate or (b) 0.5% per annum above the Federal Funds Rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings senior unsecured debt rating. The Holdings Credit Facility requires Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory surplus at $1.5 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions after December 31, 2005, which at December 31, 2008, was $1,821.1 million. As of December 31, 2008, Holdings was in compliance with all Holdings Credit Facility covenants. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were outstanding letters of credit of $28.0 million and $17.2 million, respectively, under the Holdings Credit Facility. Costs incurred in connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings Credit Facility were $1.3 million and $1.4 million for December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Exposure to Catastrophes. Like other insurance and reinsurance companies, we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. A large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties, facultative certificates and across lines of business. We focus on potential losses that could result from any single event, or series of events as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These techniques range from non-modeled deterministic approaches, such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe prone zones and applying historic damage factors, to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis. No single universal model is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which we conduct business. In addition, the form, quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for our licensed models, which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units. The combination of techniques potentially adds to the imprecision of our estimates. Also, while most models have been updated to better incorporate factors that contributed to unprecedented industry storm losses in 2004 and 2005, such as flood, storm surge and demand surge, catastrophe model projections are inherently imprecise. In addition, uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data. Nevertheless, when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events. Projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the PML. We define PML as anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake. The PML will vary depending upon the severity of modeled simulated losses and the make-up of the in force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods , such as 100-year events and 250-year events . For example, a 100-year PML corresponds to the estimated loss from a single event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period. Conversely, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated PML. It is important to notes that PMLs are estimates. Modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model. As a result, there can 81 be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML. From an enterprise risk management perspective, management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure we may underwrite. The limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to our financial resources and expected earnings and risk/reward analyses of the business being underwritten. Management estimated that the projected economic loss from its largest 100-year event does not exceed 10% of its projected 2009 shareholders equity. Economic loss is the gross PML reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and income taxes. The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate reinsurance. Management also monitors and controls its largest PMLs at multiple points along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 year return periods. This process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital management decisions. Our catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process. We believe that our greatest worldwide 1 in 100 year exposure to a single catastrophic event is to a hurricane affecting the U.S. southeast coast, where we estimate we have a gross PML exposure of $845 million. See also table under ITEM 1, Business - Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements . If such a single catastrophe loss were to occur, management estimates that the economic loss to us would be approximately $534 million. The estimate involves multiple variables, including which Everest entity would experience the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded. We may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of our operations. Reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing, terms, conditions and availability of coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection. The amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time, reflecting our view of our exposures and the cost of reinsurance. We have not recently purchased corporate retrocessional protection and have generally de-emphasized the purchase of specific reinsurance by our underwriters, reflecting our view that our exposures, in the context of our capital, financial position and current market pricing, do not warrant reinsurance purchases at current price levels. See ITEM 1, Business - Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements for further details. 82 Contractual Obligations. The following table shows our contractual obligations for the period indicated: Payments due by period Less than More than (Dollars in millions) Total 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years 8.75% Senior notes $ 200.0 $ - $ 200.0 $ - $ - 5.40% Senior notes 250.0 - - - 250.0 Junior subordinated debt 329.9 - - - 329.9 6.6% Long term notes 400.0 - - - 400.0 Interest expense (1) 2,152.6 77.2 128.2 119.5 1,827.7 Employee benefit plans 5.1 5.1 - - - Operating lease agreements 93.6 8.6 17.8 16.4 50.8 Gross reserve for losses and LAE (2) 8,840.7 1,806.5 3,218.8 1,064.5 2,750.9 Total $ 12,271.9 $ 1,897.4 $ 3,564.8 $ 1,200.4 $ 5,609.3 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) _________________ (1) Interest expense on 6.6% long term notes is assumed to be fixed through contractual term. (2) Loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of losses from claim and related settlement costs. Both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash flows uncertain. Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of loss and LAE payments could differ from our estimates. The contractual obligations for senior notes, long term notes and junior subordinated debt are the responsibility of Holdings. We have sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to satisfy these obligations. Holdings generally depends upon dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary for its funding, capital contributions from Group or access to the capital markets. Our various operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle outstanding reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that we, and each of our entities, have sufficient financial resources or ready access thereto, to meet all obligations. Dividends. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we declared and paid shareholder dividends of $118.6 million, $121.4 million and $39.0 million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, we are partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to our shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. Management expects that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest Re ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings general corporate needs and that Holdings and Bermuda Re will have the ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Group general corporate needs. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of $285.0 million, $245.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, Bermuda Re paid dividends to Group of $120.0 million, $0.0 million and $60.0 million, respectively. See ITEM 1, Business Regulatory Matters Dividends and ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Application of New Accounting Standards. In July 2006, Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) released FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ( FAS 109 ). FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Further, FIN 48 expands the required disclosures associated with uncertain tax positions. As a result of the 83 implementation of FIN 48, we recorded no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and no adjustment to beginning retained earnings. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value consistently in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We adopted FAS 157 as of January 1, 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans ( FAS 158 ). FAS 158 requires an employer to (a) recognize in its financial statements an asset for a plan over funded status or a liability for a plan under funded status, (b) measure a plan assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan in the year in which the changes occur as other comprehensive income. We adopted FAS 158 for the reporting period ended December 31, 2006. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115 ( FAS 159 ). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. We adopted FAS 159 as of January 1, 2007. In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161 Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 ( FAS 161 ). FAS 161 requires entities to provide additional disclosures on derivative and hedging activities regarding their effect on financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We will adopt FAS 161 on January 1, 2009. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-3 Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active ( FAS 157-3 ). FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of FAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ), in a market that is not active. This FASB Staff Position was effective upon issuance. In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 132(R)-1 Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets ( FAS 132(R)-1 ). FAS 132(R)-1 requires additional disclosures about plan assets. Additional disclosures include investment policies and strategies, fair value of each major plan asset category, inputs and valuation techniques used to develop fair value and any significant concentrations of risk. This FASB Staff Position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company will adopt FAS 132(R)-1 for the reporting period ending December 31, 2009. Market Sensitive Instruments. The SEC Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, market sensitive instruments ). We do not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. Our current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market conditions and our tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, we have invested in equity securities. We have also written a small number of equity index put options. 84 The overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with our capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which our investments provide liquidity. This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period. Interest Rate Risk. Our $13.7 billion investment portfolio at December 31, 2008 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk and some foreign currency exchange rate risk, and some equity securities, which are subject to price fluctuations and some foreign exchange rate risk. The impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact. Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, from a change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes prepayment risk on the $1,878.4 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $10,802.7 million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security. The tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio (including $1,889.8 million of short-term investments) for the periods indicated based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates. For legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios. Impact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points At December 31, 2008 -200 -100 0 100 200 (Dollars in millions) Total Market/Fair Value $ 13,836.0 $ 13,277.1 $ 12,692.5 $ 12,088.1 $ 11,507.2 Market/Fair Value Change from Base (%) 9.0 % 4.6 % 0.0 % -4.8 % -9.3 % Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 857.0 $ 436.9 $ - $ (453.6) $ (893.9) Impact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points At December 31, 2007 -200 -100 0 100 200 (Dollars in millions) Total Market/Fair Value $ 13,471.3 $ 12,981.6 $ 12,471.3 $ 11,900.2 $ 11,322.5 Market/Fair Value Change from Base (%) 8.0 % 4.1 % 0.0 % -4.6 % -9.2 % Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 750.4 $ 382.2 $ - $ (423.3) $ (849.7) We had $8,840.7 million and $9,040.6 million of gross reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These amounts are recorded at their nominal value, as opposed to present value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the present value of the reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the present value of the reserves decreases and, conversely, as interest rates decline, the present value 85 increases. These movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments. While the difference between present value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements, our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid. Our loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 4.2 years, which is reasonably consistent with our fixed income portfolio. If we were to discount our loss and LAE reserves, net of $0.7 billion of reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses, the discount would be approximately $1.5 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately $6.7 billion, representing approximately 53% of the market value of the fixed maturity investment portfolio funds. Equity Risk. Equity risk is the potential change in fair and/or market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from changing equity prices. Our equity investments consist of a diversified portfolio of individual securities and exchange traded and mutual funds, which invest principally in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges. The primary objective of the equity portfolio was to obtain greater total return relative to bonds over time through market appreciation and income. The tables below display the impact on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a 10% and 20% change in equity prices up and down for the periods indicated. Impact of Percentage Change in Equity Fair/Market Values At December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Fair/Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 109.4 $ 123.1 $ 136.7 $ 150.4 $ 164.1 After-tax Change in Fair/Market Value (18.0) (9.0) - 9.0 18.0 Impact of Percentage Change in Equity Fair/Market Values At December 31, 2007 (Dollars in millions) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Fair/Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 1,248.0 $ 1,404.0 $ 1,560.0 $ 1,716.0 $ 1,871.9 After-tax Change in Fair/Market Value (244.5) (122.3) - 122.3 244.5 Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of our non-U.S./Bermuda ( foreign ) operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Generally, we prefer to maintain the capital of our operations in U.S. dollar assets, although this varies by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. We mitigate foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of our assets to our corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with FAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation , we translate the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008 there has been no material change in exposure to foreign exchange rates as compared to December 31, 2007. 86 The tables below display the potential impact of a parallel and immediate 10% and 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure for the periods indicated. This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent At December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (71.1) $ (47.9) $ - $ 65.9 $ 145.3 Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent At December 31, 2007 (Dollars in millions) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (90.6) $ (56.9) $ - $ 73.7 $ 160.0 Equity Index Put Options. Although not considered material in the context of our aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, we have issued six equity index put options based on the S&P 500 index and one equity index put option based on the FTSE 100 index, that are market sensitive and sufficiently unique to warrant supplemental disclosure. We sold six equity index put options based on the S&P 500 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $22.5 million. These contracts each have a single exercise date, with maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at or above the strike prices on the exercise dates, which fall between June 2017 and March 2031. If the S&P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2008 index value, we estimate the probability for each contract of the S&P 500 index falling below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 55%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. At December 31, 2008, the present value of these theoretical maximum payouts using a 6% discount factor was $239.6 million. We sold one equity index put option based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $6.7 million. This contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike price of 5,989.75. No amount will be payable under this contract if the FTSE 100 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower than the strike price on the exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2008 index value, we estimate the probability that the FTSE 100 index contract will fall below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 57%. The theoretical maximum payout under the contract would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was zero. At December 31, 2008, the present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6% discount factor was $24.2 million. Because the equity index put options meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133, we report the fair value of these instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a liability and record any changes to fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as net derivative expense or income. Our financial statements reflect fair values for our obligations on these equity put options at December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $60.6 million and $39.7 million, respectively; however, we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any payment at all. 87 As there is no active market for these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return. The tables below display the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the equity indices, which are the principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair value for the period indicated. As these are estimates, there can be no assurance regarding future market performance. The asymmetrical results of the interest rate and S&P 500 and FTSE 100 indices shift reflect that the liability cannot fall below zero whereas it can increase to its theoretical maximum.
