Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company or Invesco ) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Global financial markets in 2014 were characterized by two distinct periods. The first half of 2014 saw the continuation of the equity market strength seen in 2013. Returns for most equity markets across the globe were positive, if not strong, driven in part by supportive conditions from global central banks. The second half of 2014 saw the return of volatility and sell-off of risk assets, especially in Europe and emerging markets. A number of factors contributed to the souring of investor sentiment including geopolitical risks in Russia and Greece and a genuine deterioration of macro-economic data in Continental Europe. As a result, most European and emerging markets declined in 2014 as seen by the FTSE 100, which was down 2.7% , and the MSCI Emerging Markets index, which declined 4.6% . The U.S. market fell from its highs in mid-2014, but still managed an impressive S&P 500 return of 11.4% . Japan was also positive in 2014, with the Nikkei 225 up 7.1% , which was driven by the fiscal and monetary policy actions taken by the Japanese government and central bank, respectively. The sell-off of risk assets benefited the US Treasury market as investors sought the safety of US government bonds. Yields on the 10- year and 30- year Treasury reached historic lows benefiting returns of government bond indices. The Barclays US Aggregate Bond index returned 6.0% for the year. The table below summarizes the year ended December 31 returns based on price appreciation/(depreciation) of several major market indices for 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 : Year ended December 31, Equity Index 2014 2013 2012 S&P 500 11.4% 29.6% 13.4% FTSE 100 (2.7)% 14.4% 5.8% Nikkei 225 7.1% 56.7% 22.9% MSCI Emerging Markets (4.6)% (5.0)% 15.2% Bond Index Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond 6.0% (2.0)% 4.2% Throughout 2014, we continued to execute our long-term strategy, which further improved our ability to serve clients, strengthened our investment performance, and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins. We also took advantage of opportunities in the market and invested in our products and capabilities, our brand, our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and competitive position for long-term success. As a global investment management firm dedicated to delivering investment excellence to our clients, Invesco is committed to further strengthening and enhancing our risk management approach. We believe a key factor in Invesco's ability to manage through the economic uncertainty of recent years was our integrated approach to risk management. Invesco's enterprise risk management approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization. Broadly, our approach includes two governance structures - one for investments and another for business risk. 26 Table of Contents Investment risk oversight is supported by the Global Performance Measurement and Risk group, which provides senior management and the Board with insight into core investment risks, and the investment teams. Business risk oversight is supported by the Corporate Risk Management Committee, which facilitates a focus on strategic, operational and other key business risks, and related committees. Further, functional and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business. As a result of our efforts in this area, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has designated our enterprise risk management rating as "strong." In addition, we benefited from our long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management. One of Invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. Our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world. This broad diversification mitigates the impact on Invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels. In March 2014, leadership of the U.K. Equities team transitioned to Mark Barnett. Mr. Barnett and the team delivered strong investment performance to clients throughout 2014. Although we experienced outflows in the U.K. as a result of the transition, dominated by a single client outflow of $13.1 billion, our U.K. and Continental Europe business grew and became more diversified throughout 2014, with significant flows into fixed income, non-U.K. equities, real estate and multi-asset capabilities. In particular, U.K. retail achieved a record year of gross sales across a range of capabilities, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business. The investment management industry is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination. In the United States, United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions in which the company operates, governmental authorities regularly make inquiries, hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. On April 28, 2014, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced a penalty of 18.6 million ($31.1 million) related to the settlement of an enforcement proceeding pertaining to the company's compliance with certain FCA rules and regulations for the period from May 2008 to November 2012. This charge, together with settlement-related legal costs of $0.5 million, reduced 2014 diluted earnings per share by $0.07. The company believes its current systems and controls now are adequate and in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. One of the company's strategic imperatives is to harness the power of our global platform by improving effectiveness and efficiency, and allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business. Consistent with this objective, during 2014 an initiative was undertaken to align the company's location footprint to reflect current and future business needs. This resulted in the company recording business optimization initiative charges of $40.3 million that include $33.1 million associated with vacating leased properties and $7.2 million of staff severance. These charges reduced 2014 diluted earnings per share by $0.07. During 2014, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services upgraded the company's senior unsecured debt rating to A/Stable from A-/Positive. Also during 2014, Moody's Investors Service upgraded their rating of the company's debt to A2/Stable from A3/Stable. The upgrade reflected Moody's view that Invesco has broken into the top tier of scale-enabled investment managers. The Moody's announcement commented that the company's growing market presence, broad investment capabilities, multi-faceted distribution channels, and financial flexibility all support this conclusion. Regulators in various jurisdictions have proposed or are exploring changes to the manner in which fund distributers are compensated for the services they provide. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority implemented its Retail Distribution Review ( RDR ), which is reshaping the manner in which retail investment funds are sold in the U.K. by changing how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products. Invesco prepared for the RDR implementation by offering investment funds to U.K. investors which are priced at a reduced gross management fee, but which in turn do not result in the payment by the company of a distribution fee to the intermediary. These changes are not expected to have a significant impact on net revenues as investors move into these offerings. Other countries have announced similar distribution fee reviews. In the U.S., the SEC has previously proposed and may repurpose significant changes to Rule 12b-1, and may propose other regulatory changes impacting distribution of investment funds. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II ( MiFID II ) in the EU seeks to promote a single market for wholesale and retail transactions in financial instruments. 27 Table of Contents Presentation of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. The company is required to consolidate certain managed funds from time-to-time, as discussed more fully in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 -- "Accounting Policies -- Basis of Accounting and Consolidation." Investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this Report as either Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products (CSIP), which generally include investment products in which Invesco holds the majority of the voting rights or partnerships in which the company has substantive equity at risk but in which the other investors lack removal or liquidation rights, or Consolidated Investment Products (CIP), which includes consolidated nominally-held investment products. This distinction is important, as it differentiates the company's economic risk associated with each type of consolidated managed fund. The company's economic risk with respect to each investment in a CSIP and a CIP is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees. Gains and losses arising from nominally-held CIP do not have a significant impact on the company's results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. Gains and losses arising from majority-held CSIP could have a significant impact on the company's results of operations, as the company has greater economic risk associated with its investment. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, - Note 1 "Accounting Policies," Note 19 , "Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products," and Note 20 , "Consolidated Investment Products," for additional information regarding the impact of consolidation of managed funds. The majority of the company's CIP balances are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. The impact of CIP is so significant to the presentation of the company Consolidated Financial Statements (but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company) that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-GAAP disclosures. The following discussion therefore combines the results presented under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) with the company non-GAAP presentation. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains four distinct sections, which follow after the Assets Under Management discussion: Results of Operations (years ended December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 ); Schedule of Non-GAAP Information; Balance Sheet Discussion; and Liquidity and Capital Resources. Each of the Consolidated Financial Statement summary sections (Results of Operations, Balance Sheet Discussion, and Liquidity and Capital Resources) begins with a table illustrating the impact of CIP relative to the company's consolidated totals. The impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 was a reduction of $35.2 million . This indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount, reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by Invesco for managing these investment products. The narrative in each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company, before consolidation of CIP, as well as of the financial statement activity of CIP. Additionally, wherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. To further enhance the readability of the Results of Operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and other income and expenses (non-operating income/expense) sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company income statements for the periods presented. 28 Table of Contents Summary Operating Information Summary operating information for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 is presented in the table below. $ in millions, other than per share amounts, operating margins, ratios and AUM Year ended December 31, U.S. GAAP Financial Measures Summary (1) 2014 2013 2012 Operating revenues 5,147.1 4,644.6 4,050.4 Operating income 1,276.9 1,120.2 842.6 Operating margin 24.8 % 24.1 % 20.8 % Net income attributable to common shareholders 988.1 940.3 677.1 Diluted EPS 2.27 2.10 1.49 Debt/equity ratio including CIP (%) 73.9 % 64.3 % 56.2 % Non-GAAP Financial Measures Summary Net revenues (2) 3,608.3 3,252.0 2,836.0 Adjusted operating income (3) 1,495.0 1,292.1 1,012.1 Adjusted operating margin (3) 41.4 % 39.7 % 35.7 % Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (4) 1,094.8 953.3 748.6 Adjusted diluted EPS (4) 2.51 2.13 1.65 Debt/equity ratio excluding CIP (%) (5) 19.1 % 19.1 % 14.5 % Assets Under Management (1) Ending AUM (billions) 792.4 778.7 667.4 Average AUM (billions) 790.3 725.6 645.3 _________ (1) On December 31, 2013, the company completed the sale of Atlantic Trust. The company has adopted a discontinued operations presentation for Atlantic Trust. Amounts presented represent continuing operations and exclude Atlantic Trust, with the exception of net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share. (2) Net revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure. Net revenues are operating revenues plus our proportional share of the net revenues of our joint venture investments, less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus management and performance fees earned from CIP, less other revenue recorded by CIP, plus other reconciling items. See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information" for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues. (3) Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted operating margin is adjusted operating income divided by net revenues. Adjusted operating income includes operating income plus our proportional share of the net operating income of our joint venture investments, the operating income impact of the consolidation of investment products, acquisition/disposition related adjustments, compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans, and other reconciling items. See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information," for the reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income. (4) Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders is net income attributable to common shareholders adjusted to exclude the net income of CIP, add back acquisition/disposition related adjustments, the net income impact of deferred compensation plans and other reconciling items. Adjustments made to net income attributable to common shareholders are tax-effected in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders. By calculation, adjusted diluted EPS is adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (for diluted EPS). See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information," for the reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders. (5) The debt-to-equity ratio excluding CIP is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for a recalculation of this ratio and other important disclosures. 29 Table of Contents Investment Capabilities Performance Overview Invesco's first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the long-term for our clients. The table below presents the one-, three- and five-year performance of our actively managed investment products measured by the percentage of AUM ahead of benchmark and AUM in the top half of peer group. (1) Benchmark Comparison Peer Group Comparison % of AUM Ahead of Benchmark % of AUM In Top Half of Peer Group 1yr 3yr 5yr 1yr 3yr 5yr Equities U.S. Core 22 % 26 % 25 % 38 % 33 % 49 % U.S. Growth 25 % 82 % 25 % 43 % 38 % 74 % U.S. Value 7 % 55 % 54 % 37 % 55 % 54 % Sector Funds 67 % 53 % 73 % 14 % 12 % 11 % U.K. 99 % 100 % 100 % 91 % 100 % 98 % Canadian 29 % 51 % 51 % 26 % 50 % 51 % Asian 63 % 95 % 80 % 38 % 72 % 67 % Continental European 70 % 98 % 100 % 61 % 84 % 93 % Global 29 % 66 % 85 % 37 % 83 % 85 % Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets 98 % 97 % 99 % 86 % 84 % 98 % Fixed Income Money Market 65 % 65 % 65 % 95 % 96 % 97 % U.S. Fixed Income 78 % 93 % 92 % 64 % 80 % 98 % Global Fixed Income 58 % 91 % 69 % 47 % 78 % 55 % Stable Value 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Other Alternatives 59 % 37 % 48 % 71 % 68 % 68 % Balanced 52 % 54 % 71 % 78 % 93 % 99 % _____________________________ (1) AUM measured in the one-, three-, and five-year peer group rankings represents 60% , 60% , and 60% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one-, three-, and five-year basis represents 71% , 70% , and 69% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, as of December 31, 2014 . Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund's market (Lipper, Morningstar, IMA, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA, Value Research) and are asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and preceding month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each Global Investment Performance Standard (GIPS) composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary direct real estate, unit investment trusts fund-of-funds with component funds managed by Invesco, stable value building block funds and CLOs. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor's experience. As of December 31, 2014 , 67%, 77% and 81% of ranked actively managed assets performed in the top half of peer groups on a one-year, three-year and five-year basis respectively. The U.K., Continental European and Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets equities have also had strong relative performance, with 97% or more of ranked assets beating their benchmark over three- and five-year periods. Additionally, the U.K., Continental European and Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets reflect a long-term track record of beating their peers, with 98%, 93% and 98%, respectively, of ranked assets ahead of peers on a five-year basis. Our balanced asset class reflects strong peer group comparison with 99% of ranked assets in the top half on a five-year basis. Within our fixed income asset class, Stable Value products have achieved excellent long-term performance with 100% of ranked AUM ahead of both peers and benchmark on a one-, three- and five-year basis. 30 Table of Contents Assets Under Management The following presentation and discussion of AUM includes Passive and Active AUM. Passive AUM includes ETFs, UITs, leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee, and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM. The AUM tables and the discussion below refer to AUM as long-term and short-term. Long-term AUM excludes institutional money market and Invesco PowerShares QQQ AUM. Long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds, and new funding commitments into private equity funds. Long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds. We present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements. The net flows in Invesco PowerShares QQQ AUM can also be relatively short-term in nature and, due to the relatively low revenue yield, these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield. Changes in AUM were as follows (1) : 2014 2013 2012 $ in billions Total AUM Active Passive Total AUM Active Passive Total AUM Active Passive January 1 778.7 639.0 139.7 667.4 553.4 114.0 607.3 511.0 96.3 Long-term inflows 183.1 150.3 32.8 179.6 137.0 42.6 131.9 102.2 29.7 Long-term outflows (175.0 ) (148.2 ) (26.8 ) (157.9 ) (123.9 ) (34.0 ) (121.5 ) (102.7 ) (18.8 ) Long-term net flows 8.1 2.1 6.0 21.7 13.1 8.6 10.4 (0.5 ) 10.9 Net flows in Invesco Powershares QQQ fund (10.7 ) (10.7 ) 3.7 3.7 0.2 0.2 Net flows in institutional money market funds (5.8 ) (5.8 ) 9.0 9.0 0.1 0.1 Total net flows (8.4 ) (3.7 ) (4.7 ) 34.4 22.1 12.3 10.7 (0.4 ) 11.1 Market gains and losses/reinvestment 34.7 27.9 6.8 78.8 64.5 14.3 48.3 41.3 7.0 Acquisitions/dispositions, net (1.7 ) (1.7 ) Foreign currency translation (12.6 ) (12.2 ) (0.4 ) (1.9 ) (1.0 ) (0.9 ) 2.8 3.2 (0.4 ) December 31 792.4 651.0 141.4 778.7 639.0 139.7 667.4 553.4 114.0 Average AUM Average long-term AUM 673.5 574.4 99.1 613.7 523.3 90.4 543.5 466.1 77.4 Average AUM 790.3 647.5 142.8 725.6 598.9 126.7 645.3 535.1 110.2 Revenue yield Gross revenue yield on AUM (2) 65.5 77.2 13.0 64.4 75.6 11.6 63.1 74.2 9.3 Gross revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (2) 64.8 76.3 13.0 63.6 74.7 11.6 62.4 73.4 9.3 Net revenue yield on AUM (3) 45.7 52.9 13.0 44.8 51.8 11.6 43.9 51.1 9.3 Net revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (3) 44.8 51.8 13.0 43.9 50.7 11.6 43.3 50.3 9.3 (1) On December 31, 2013, the company completed the sale of Atlantic Trust. All AUM amounts quoted in the tables exclude the AUM of the discontinued operations, Atlantic Trust. (2) Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. Our share of the average AUM in 2014 for our JVs in China was $4.9 billion ( 2013 : $4.0 billion , 2012 : $3.0 billion ). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the net income of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. 31 Table of Contents (3) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues. Flows There are numerous drivers of AUM inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. We are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. Therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows. AUM at December 31, 2014 were $792.4 billion ( December 31, 2013 : $778.7 billion ; December 31, 2012 : $667.4 billion ). During the year ended December 31, 2014 , long-term net inflows increased AUM by $8.1 billion . Net outflows of institutional money market funds were $5.8 billion and net outflows of the Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund were $10.7 billion . During the year ended December 31, 2013 , net long-term inflows increased AUM by $21.7 billion . We experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of $9.0 billion and Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund of $3.7 billion during the year ended December 31, 2013 . During the year ended December 31, 2012 , net long-term inflows increased AUM by $10.4 billion . We experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion in Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund, and net outflows from dispositions of $1.7 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2014 included net long-term inflows of passive AUM of $6.0 billion and active net long-term inflows of $2.1 billion . Long-term net inflows were split between our retail distribution channel of $5.0 billion and our institutional distribution channel of $3.1 billion . By asset class, long-term net flows were positive for the fixed income and alternatives classes, and were negative for equity, balanced and money market classes. Long-term net inflows included $16.0 billion from clients domiciled in Continental Europe. These inflows were largely offset by long-term outflows of $13.9 billion from clients domiciled in the U.K. that were dominated by a $13.1 billion single client withdrawal, as discussed in the Executive Overview above. Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2013 included net long-term inflows of passive AUM of $8.6 billion and active net long-term AUM inflows of $13.1 billion . Net flows in 2013 were driven by net inflows of $21.4 billion into our retail distribution channel, primarily in the equity and balanced asset classes. Net flows in 2012 were driven by positive net inflows of $10.4 billion into our retail distribution channel, primarily in the fixed income and balanced asset classes, while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of $10.7 billion. Average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2014 were $790.3 billion , compared to $725.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $645.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Market Returns Market gains and losses/reinvestment of AUM includes the net change in AUM resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends. As discussed in the Executive Overview section of this Management Discussion and Analysis, global equity markets were mixed during 2014, with the U.S. market producing a strong return, but overseas markets reflecting uncertainty and finishing the year with declines. During 2013, equity markets were broadly up across regions. During the year ended December 31, 2014 , positive market movement increased AUM by $34.7 billion , with $26.0 billion attributed to our equity asset class. Our fixed income, alternatives and balanced asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , market gains increased AUM by $78.8 billion and included $77.4 billion in positive market movement of our equity asset class. Our balanced asset class was also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , market gains increased AUM by $48.3 billion and included gains in our equity asset class of $33.3 billion . 32 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Rates Foreign exchange rate movements in our AUM result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as non-U.S. Dollar denominated AUM is translated into U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of the company. The table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation into the U.S. Dollar at December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 : Foreign Exchange Rates December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Pound Sterling ($ per ) 1.559 1.655 1.625 Canadian Dollar (CAD per $) 1.158 1.063 0.996 Japan ( per $) 119.880 105.080 85.520 Euro ($ per Euro) 1.210 1.378 1.319 During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we experienced decreases in AUM of $12.6 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven by the weakening of the Pound Sterling, the Euro, Canadian Dollar, and the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of AUM denominated in these currencies into U.S. Dollars. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , AUM decreased by $1.9 billion due to foreign exchange rate changes impacted by the weakening of the Canadian Dollar and the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Pound Sterling and the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. These changes were reflected in the translation of AUM denominated in these currencies into U.S. Dollars. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , foreign exchange rate changes increased AUM by $2.8 billion and was driven by the strengthening of the Pound Sterling, Euro, and the Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar. Revenue Yield Net revenue yield on AUM increased 0.9 basis points to 45.7 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 level of 44.8 basis points (December 31, 2012: 43.9 basis points). Excluding performance fees, the net revenue yield increased 0.9 basis points to 44.8 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 level of 43.9 basis points (December 31, 2012: 43.3 basis points). Changes in our AUM mix significantly impact our net revenue yield. For example, on an asset class basis, our equity, alternative, and balanced AUM generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market and fixed income AUM. The combination of average equity, average alternative and average balanced AUM increased from 65.1% in 2013 to 67.6% of total average AUM in 2014 . The comparable averages for money market and fixed income AUM both decreased. This change in asset class mix correlates with the increase in net revenue yield in 2014 when compared to 2013 . The tables that follow also analyze AUM into active and passive style. Passive AUM generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. At December 31, 2014 , passive AUM were $141.4 billion , representing 17.8% of total AUM at that date; whereas at December 31, 2013 , passive AUM were $139.7 billion , representing 17.9% of our total AUM at that date. The increase in passive AUM during 2014 is driven by net long-term inflows and market, and is offset by outflows from the Powershares QQQ Nasdaq-100 index tracking fund. The Powershares QQQ fund AUM decreased to $40.7 billion at December 31, 2014 compared to $45.7 billion at December 31, 2013 ( $30.4 billion at December 31, 2012). The revenue yield for Invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point, reimbursing Invesco for the portfolio trading services provided to the fund. In the year ended December 31, 2014 , the net revenue yield on passive AUM was 13.0 basis points compared to 11.6 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of 1.4 basis points, due to changes in mix of passive AUM. The net revenue yield (before performance fees) on active AUM increased from 50.7 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2013 to 51.8 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2014 . In 2013, net revenue yield (before performance fees) on active AUM increased over the 2012 level of 50.3 basis points. Gross revenue yield on AUM increased 1.1 basis points to 65.5 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 level of 64.4 basis points (December 31, 2012: 63.1 basis points). Management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 2 to the Changes in AUM table above. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues. 33 Table of Contents Changes in our AUM by channel, asset class, and client domicile,

The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 was a reduction of $35.2 million . This indicates that the consolidation of CIP reduced consolidated revenues by $35.2 million , reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the operating revenues earned by Invesco for managing these investment products. The discussion below includes the use of non-GAAP financial measures. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures.

See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. Operating revenues increased by 10.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $5,147.1 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $4,644.6 million ). Net revenues increased by 11.0% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3,608.3 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $3,252.0 million ). Operating revenues increased by 14.7% in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $ 4,644.6 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 4,050.4 million ). Net revenues increased by 14.7% in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $3,252.0 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $2,836.0 million ). A significant portion of our business and AUM is based outside of the U.S. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. As noted in the AUM discussion, a significant amount of our AUM by client are domiciled in the U.K., and while the Pound Sterling's rate relative to the U.S. Dollar weakened during 2014, the average rate during 2014 was stronger than the average rate during 2013 resulting in a positive effect when translating our U.K. revenue into U.S. Dollars when compared to 2013. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating revenues by $29.2 million , equivalent to 0.6% of total operating revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 ($47.4 million decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012 , or 1% of 2013 total operating revenues). Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. Market movements are discussed in the "Executive Overview" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. During 2014 market value increases, combined with net new business inflows, contributed to a 8.9% increase in average AUM when compared to 2013 . 41 Table of Contents Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds, investment companies with variable capital (ICVCs), exchange-traded funds, investment trusts, other collective investment vehicles, and institutional management contracts. Investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary daily as the levels of AUM change resulting from inflows, outflows and market movements. Investment management fees for products offered in the institutional distribution channel are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed. Investment management fees increased by $454.5 million ( 12.6% ) in the year ended December 31, 2014 , to $4,054.1 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $3,599.6 million ). This compares to a 8.9% increase in average AUM and a 9.7% increase in average long-term AUM. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by $28.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . After allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees increased by $425.9 million. In April 2014, our U.K. Invesco Perpetual business introduced a single Fund Management Fee (FMF) for their retail funds to replace the separate annual management fee and registration fee. The single FMF removes the complexity of having separate elements to the fee structure and is designed to respond to the regulatory policy underlying the U.K. Retail Distribution Review by providing a clear disclosure of product fees charged to investors. This resulted in an increase in investment management fees of $84.2 million and a corresponding decrease in service and distribution fees. Also contributing to the increase in investment management fees, net revenue yield is higher in the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to changes in the composition of our AUM, as discussed above. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM and revenue yields during the year ended December 31, 2014 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. Investment management fees increased by $471.8 million ( 15.1% ) in the year ended December 31, 2013 , to $ 3,599.6 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 3,127.8 million ). The increase compares to a 12.4% increase in average AUM and a 12.9% increase in average long-term AUM. As discussed above, the net revenue yield was higher in the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 due to changes in the composition of our AUM. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM and revenue yields during the year ended December 31, 2013 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $41.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Service and Distribution Fees Service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses, including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds, and ICVCs, and administrative fees earned from closed-ended funds. Service fees also include transfer agent fees, which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. U.S. distribution fees include 12b-1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include asset-based sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds. Distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed. Generally, retail products offered outside of the U.S. do not generate a separate distribution fee; the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services. In the year ended December 31, 2014 , service and distribution fees increased by $20.3 million ( 2.3% ) to $893.1 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $872.8 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in service and distribution fees was $20.7 million. The increase in service and distribution fees during 2014 is due primarily to increases in transfer agency fees of $42.2 million and distribution and redemption fees of $17.4 million, partially offset by decrease in administration and custodial fees of $39.0 million. The fee increases in 2014 are primarily attributable to the increases in average AUM. As mentioned above, the U.K. business introduced a single FMF in April 2014. This resulted in an increase in investment management fees of $84.2 million and a corresponding decrease in service and distribution fees. 42 Table of Contents In the year ended December 31, 2013 , service and distribution fees increased by $101.2 million ( 13.1% ) to $ 872.8 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 771.6 million ) due primarily to increases in distribution and redemption fees of $42.5 million, administration and custodial fees of $49.6 million and transfer agency fees of $12.3 million. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 . The fee increases in 2013 are attributable to the increases in average AUM and the expiration of fund waivers. Performance Fees Performance fee revenues, including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts, are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. Such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date, when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with Method 1 of ASC Topic 605-20-S99, Revenue Recognition - Services - SEC Materials. Cash receipt of performance fees generally occurs after the contractual measurement date; however, the company may receive, from time-to-time, cash distributions of carried interest before the measurement date. Such distributions are reflected as deferred carried interest liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect, and therefore the company has performance fee arrangements that include monthly, quarterly and annual measurement dates. Given the uniqueness of each transaction, performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized. The company does not recognize performance fee revenues if there are any future performance contingencies associated with them. Performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes, since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance. Of our $792.4 billion in AUM at December 31, 2014 , approximately $50.2 billion or 6.3% , could potentially earn performance fees. In the year ended December 31, 2014 , performance fees increased by $5.2 million ( 9.3% ) to $61.1 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $55.9 million ). Foreign exchange movements increased performance fees by $1.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange movements, performance fees increased by $3.8 million. The performance fees generated in 2014 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams: U.K. Equities ($35.6 million), Direct Real Estate ($9.8 million), Asset Allocation ($3.2 million), Asia Pacific teams ($3.1 million), and Global Quantitative Equity team ($2.9 million). During the year ended December 31, 2014, performance fees included $8.0 million (year ended December 31, 2013: $17.5 million) from Edinburgh Investment Trust plc. The company agreed to a reduction in the performance fee receivable from the Trust in relation to the Trusts' year ending March 31, 2014, with no performance fees in future years. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , performance fees increased by $14.5 million ( 35.0% ) to $ 55.9 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 41.4 million ). The performance fees generated in 2013 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams: U.K. Equities ($36.7 million), Global Quantitative Equity team ($4.4 million), Australian Equity ($3.4 million), Direct Real Estate ($1.6 million), and the Fixed Income team ($6.5 million). Other Revenues Other revenues include fees derived from our UIT operations, transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds, and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups. Real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties. Private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of, and fees from providing advice to, portfolio companies held by the funds. These transaction fees are recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed. Other revenues also include the revenues of CIP. In its capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company earns other revenues related to transactional sales charges resulting from the sale of UIT products and from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer price of securities temporarily held to form new UIT products. These revenues are recorded as other revenues net of concessions to dealers who distribute UITs to investors. In the year ended December 31, 2014 , other revenues increased by $22.5 million ( 19.3% ) to $138.8 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $116.3 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in other revenues $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in other revenues was $22.9 million . 43 Table of Contents The increase in other revenues includes increases in real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $6.9 million, mutual funds front end fees of $6.2 million, UIT revenues of $4.5 million and other revenues of $6.1 million, partially offset by decreases in transaction commissions of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . In the year ended December 31, 2013 , other revenues increased by $6.7 million ( 6.1% ) to $ 116.3 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 109.6 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in other revenues by $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in other revenues was $7.7 million. The increase in other revenues included increases in transaction commissions of $2.0 million generated by our private equity group, UIT revenues of $3.5 million, mutual fund front end fees of $6.3 million and other revenues of $1.1 million, partially offset by decreases in real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include periodic renewal commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients' assets over the time they are invested, and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value and apply to much of the company's non-U.S. retail operations, where they can also take the form of management fee rebates. The revenues from our U.S. retail operations include 12b-1 distribution fees, which are passed through to brokers who sell the funds as third-party distribution expenses along with additional marketing support distribution costs. Both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying AUM of the brokers' clients. Third-party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker-dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of AUM within a certain contracted period of time). These commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $141.5 million ( 9.5% ) in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $1,630.7 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $1,489.2 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $9.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses was $132.0 million . The increase includes increases in renewal commissions of $49.3 million, distribution fees of $57.1 million, transfer agent fees of $16.3 million, external commissions of $8.9 million and administration fees of $0.8 million. The increases are offset by decreases in sub advisory fees of $0.4 million. The overall increase is reflective of the higher related retail management fees and service and distribution fees. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $181.0 million ( 13.8% ) in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $1,489.2 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 1,308.2 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $14.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses was $195.7 million. The increase includes increases in renewal commissions of $109.4 million, distribution fees of $70.6 million, transfer agent fees of $11.6 million, external commissions of $5.0 million and administration fees of $0.9 million. The increases are offset by decreases in sub advisory fees of $1.8 million. The overall increase is reflective of the higher related retail management fees and service and distribution fees. As part of the outsourcing of the U.K. transfer agency, operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense of $15.3 million in 2012, which impacts the analysis above. This additional expense is attributable to periods prior to 2012. Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company's most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49% investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (the Invesco Great Wall joint venture). Our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments increased by $5.0 million ( 9.7% ) to $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 (year ended December 31, 2013 : $51.7 million ). The increase 44 Table of Contents moved in line with our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2014 , which was $4.9 billion compared to $4.0 billion at the year ended December 31, 2013 . Our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments increased by $14.2 million (37.9%) to $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $37.5 million). The increase moved in line with our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which was $4.0 billion , compared to $3.0 billion at the year ended December 31, 2012 . Management, performance and other fees earned from CIP Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of CIP in calculating net revenues. As management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The elimination of management and performance fees earned from CIP decreased by $2.5 million to $35.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 (year ended December 31, 2013 : $38.3 million ). The decrease is due primarily to the impact of deconsolidation and paydowns of CLO notes exceeding the impact of newly consolidated CLO notes. The elimination of management and performance fees earned from CIP decreased by $2.7 million to $38.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $41.0 million). The decrease is primarily due to the impact of funds deconsolidated during the year ended December 31, 2013 . Once funds are deconsolidated, the management and performance fees are no longer eliminated and are reflected in the respective revenue line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Operating Expenses The main categories of operating expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows: Variance Years ended December 31, 2014 vs 2013 2013 vs 2012 $ in millions 2014 2013 2012 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Employee compensation 1,394.5 1,329.3 1,228.0 65.2 4.9 % 101.3 8.2 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,630.7 1,489.2 1,308.2 141.5 9.5 % 181.0 13.8 % Marketing 112.1 98.6 102.2 13.5 13.7 % (3.6 ) (3.5 )% Property, office and technology 336.4 292.8 265.1 43.6 14.9 % 27.7 10.4 % General and administrative 396.5 311.3 296.1 85.2 27.4 % 15.2 5.1 % Transaction and integration 3.2 8.2 (3.2 ) (100.0 )% (5.0 ) (61.0 )% Total operating expenses 3,870.2 3,524.4 3,207.8 345.8 9.8 % 316.6 9.9 % 45 Table of Contents The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. $ in millions 2014 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2013 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2012 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues Employee compensation 1,394.5 36.0 % 27.1 % 1,329.3 37.7 % 28.6 % 1,228.0 38.3 % 30.3 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,630.7 42.1 % 31.7 % 1,489.2 42.3 % 32.1 % 1,308.2 40.8 % 32.3 % Marketing 112.1 2.9 % 2.2 % 98.6 2.8 % 2.1 % 102.2 3.2 % 2.5 % Property, office and technology 336.4 8.7 % 6.5 % 292.8 8.3 % 6.3 % 265.1 8.3 % 6.5 % General and administrative 396.5 10.3 % 7.7 % 311.3 8.8 % 6.7 % 296.1 9.2 % 7.3 % Transaction and integration % % 3.2 0.1 % 0.1 % 8.2 0.2 % 0.2 % Total operating expenses 3,870.2 100.0 % 75.2 % 3,524.4 100.0 % 75.9 % 3,207.8 100.0 % 79.1 % During the year ended December 31, 2014 , operating expenses increased by $345.8 million ( 9.8% ) to $3,870.2 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $ 3,524.4 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating expenses by $17.7 million , or 0.5% of total operating expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in operating expenses was $328.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , operating expenses increased by $ 316.6 million ( 9.9% ) to $ 3,524.4 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 3,207.8 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in operating expenses by $40.2 million, or 1.1% of total operating expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in operating expenses was $356.8 million. Employee Compensation Employee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and share-based payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in employee compensation. Employee compensation increased $65.2 million ( 4.9% ) to $1,394.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 (year ended December 31, 2013 : $1,329.3 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased employee compensation by $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in employee compensation was $64.6 million . Direct compensation increased $63.9 million primarily due to increases in annual cash bonuses of $50.3 million, base salaries of $30.7 million, and share-based costs of $5.8 million, partially offset by decreases in sales commissions of $12.0 million, deferred compensation costs of $9.8 million and other compensation costs of $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . Improved company performance and increased headcount were the primary reasons for the increase in compensation. Other employee compensation increases included a $2.8 million increase in payroll taxes related to increased compensation costs and a $4.3 million increase in staff relocation costs. Such increases were offset by a $6.4 million decrease in other benefits during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . Employee compensation increased $ 101.3 million ( 8.2% ) to $ 1,329.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 1,228.0 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in employee compensation by $17.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in employee compensation was $118.7 million. Direct compensation increased $101.9 million and includes increases in annual cash bonuses of $59.5 million, base salaries of $13.7 million, sales commissions of $11.5 million, share-based costs of $2.9 million and other deferred compensation costs of $11.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Improved company performance was the primary reason for the increase in compensation. Direct compensation also included a $3.5 million increase in signing and severance costs and $3.1 million increase in bonuses linked to performance fee revenues, offset by a $4.5 million reduction in vacation expense during the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . 46 Table of Contents Other employee compensation increases included a $9.2 million increase in payroll taxes related to increased compensation costs and a $5.8 million increase in staff relocation costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , related primarily to relocations of several U.S. based groups. Headcount, on a continuing operations basis, at December 31, 2014 was 6,264 ( December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 : 5,932 and 5,889 respectively). The company had 6,128 employees at December 31, 2012 , including employees of Atlantic Trust. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company's products through conferences or other sponsorships, and the cost of marketing-related employee travel. Marketing expenses increased by $13.5 million ( 13.7% ) in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $112.1 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $98.6 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in marketing expenses by $0.2 million . After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $13.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . The increase during the year ended December 31, 2014 includes increases in advertising expenses of $6.9 million, client event expenses of $4.7 million and marketing travel and entertainment expenses of $3.0 million. These increases were primarily driven by U.K. equities advertising campaigns, increased marketing spend by U.S. retail and product launch initiatives in Asia. These increases were offset by decreases in other marketing costs of $0.8 million. Marketing expenses decreased by $ 3.6 million ( 3.5% ) in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $ 98.6 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 102.2 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the decrease in marketing expenses by $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in marketing expenses was $2.9 million. The decrease includes decreases in sales literature and research of $1.7 million, marketing travel and entertainment expenses of $1.7 million, other marketing costs of $1.7 million and corporate sponsorships of $0.7 million. These were offset by increases in client event expenses of $2.5 million, driven by advertising campaigns as we focused on specific product awareness, and advertising expense increases of $0.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property, capitalized software and computer equipment costs, minor non-capitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments, and costs related to externally provided operations, technology, middle office, and back office management services. Property, office and technology expenses increased by $43.6 million ( 14.9% ) to $336.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 (year ended December 31, 2013 : $292.8 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased property, office and technology expenses by $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $40.6 million. Property and office expenses increased $33.1 million compared to 2013 , due to a charge of $33.1 million incurred in the first quarter, associated with vacating leased properties in connection with a business optimization initiative. Property and office costs are generally trending upwards, due to market conditions. However, the business optimization initiative undertaken in 2014 has mitigated the increase in the current period, and therefore property and office costs (excluding the business optimization charge) have remained comparable to 2013. Technology and communications expenses increased $7.5 million over the comparable 2013 period. The increase includes increased depreciation and maintenance cost of $9.8 million, increased software and equipment purchases of $1.1 million and increased outsourced administration costs of $8.6 million, as 2014 reflects a full year of the U.K. and the European transfer 47 Table of Contents agency transitions to a third party provider, which were completed mid-2013. Technology and communications expenses in 2013 included a charge of $11.7 million related to the write-off of capitalized IT software development costs. Property, office and technology expenses increased by $ 27.7 million ( 10.4% ) to $292.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $265.1 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in property, office and technology expenses by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $31.4 million. Property and office expenses decreased $0.8 million over the comparable 2012 period, due to decreases in rent expense of $2.6 million, $0.8 million in operating service and property management fees, other property costs of $0.7 million and property lease decreases of $0.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in depreciation of $3.4 million. The decrease in rent expense is, in part, due to a prior year $1.7 million exit charge for leased space related to consolidation of office space. The depreciation increase includes charges for lease exits in Canada and a full year of depreciation on renovations in the Houston and Toronto offices completed during the prior year. Technology and communications expenses increased $32.2 million in 2013 over the comparable 2012 period. The increase includes increased outsourced administration costs of $15.1 million related to the U.K. and the European transfer agency transitions to a third party provider, which were completed mid-2013. The increase also includes a charge of $11.7 million in 2013 related to the write-off of capitalized IT software development costs, together with increased depreciation expenses of $6.3 million f rom an ongoing investment in portfolio management and client engagement technology initiatives. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include professional services costs, such as information service subscriptions, consulting fees, professional insurance costs, audit, tax and legal fees, non-marketing related employee travel expenditures, recruitment and training costs, and the amortization of certain intangible assets. General and administrative expenses increased by $85.2 million ( 27.4% ) to $396.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 (year ended December 31, 2013 : $311.3 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased general and administrative expenses by $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $80.4 million. The increase in general and administrative expense includes the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority penalty of $31.1 million and related legal costs of $0.5 million that were incurred in 2014. General and administrative expenses for 2014 also include an expense of $5.3 million related to a fund reimbursement settlement cost and $25.8 million in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. The latter charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees. In addition, the increase also includes a $12.0 million increase in mutual fund expenses and increases of $5.7 million in other general and administrative costs. General and administrative expenses increased by $15.2 million ( 5.1% ) to $311.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 296.1 million ). The impact of foreign exchange movements offset the increase in general and administrative expenses by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. After allowing for foreign exchange movements, the increase was $18.9 million. The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to higher professional services, contractor and legal costs of $19.2 million, including increased costs relating to regulatory-driven activity in the U.K., costs to develop the compliance and risk management support functions across Europe and costs associated with new product development. Other increases include $5.5 million of travel expenses, $2.6 million of value added taxes (VAT) and $2.5 million of information services. These other increases are offset by a $9.2 million decrease in intangible amortization expense and a $1.9 million reduction in foreign exchange settlement costs. The decrease in intangible amortization in 2013 reflects the completion in mid-2012 of amortization of brand intangibles related to an acquired business. 48 Table of Contents Transaction and integration Transaction and integration expenses include acquisition-related charges incurred during the periods to effect a business combination, including legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company's existing operations. Additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closed-end funds included in the acquisition. There were no transaction and integration expenses in 2014. Transaction and integration charges were $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 8.2 million ) and largely relate to the business acquired in 2010. Transaction and integration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relate to the final round of open-ended fund mergers and include professional services and shareholder communications costs, as well as updates in sales literature. Transaction and integration costs ceased in the first half of 2013. Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin Operating income increased by $156.7 million ( 14.0% ) to $1,276.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 (year ended December 31, 2013 : $1,120.2 million ). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), increased to 24.8% in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 24.1% in the year ended December 31, 2013 . The increase in operating income and margin resulted from a greater relative increase in operating revenues ( 10.8% ) than in operating expenses ( 9.8% ) during the period. Adjusted operating income, increased by $202.9 million ( 15.7% ) to $1,495.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1,292.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 . Adjusted operating margin increased to 41.4% in the year ended December 31, 2014 from 39.7% in the year ended December 31, 2013 . See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. Operating income increased by $ 277.6 million ( 32.9% ) to $ 1,120.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 842.6 million ). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), increased to 24.1% in the year ended December 31, 2013 from 20.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase in operating income and margin resulted from a higher relative increase in operating revenues ( 14.7% ) than in operating expenses ( 9.9% ) during the period. Adjusted operating income increased by $280.0 million ( 27.7% ) to $1,292.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from $1,012.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 . Adjusted operating margin increased to 39.7% in the year ended December 31, 2013 from 35.7% in the year ended December 31, 2012 . Other Income and Expenses The main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows: Variance Years ended December 31, 2014 vs 2013 2013 vs 2012 $ in millions 2014 2013 2012 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 32.8 35.5 29.7 (2.7 ) (7.6 )% 5.8 19.5 % Interest and dividend income 13.1 10.0 9.8 3.1 31.0 % 0.2 2.0 % Interest expense (73.1 ) (44.6 ) (52.3 ) (28.5 ) 63.9 % 7.7 (14.7 )% Other gains and losses, net 28.1 2.6 8.3 25.5 980.8 % (5.7 ) (68.7 )% Other income/(expense) of CSIP, net 24.3 2.9 21.4 737.9 % 2.9 N/A Other income and expenses of CIP: Interest and dividend income of CIP 206.5 190.0 258.5 16.5 8.7 % (68.5 ) (26.5 )% Interest expense of CIP (133.9 ) (123.3 ) (168.3 ) (10.6 ) 8.6 % 45.0 (26.7 )% Other gains/(losses) of CIP, net 20.4 61.9 (97.7 ) (41.5 ) (67.0 )% 159.6 (163.4 )% Total other income and expenses 118.2 135.0 (12.0 ) (16.8 ) (12.4 )% 147.0 N/A 49 Table of Contents Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $2.7 million ( 7.6% ) to $32.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 (year ended December 31, 2013 : $35.5 million ). The decrease in equity in earnings is driven by decreases of $6.6 million in earnings from our investment in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. and net decreases of $2.6 million in our share of the market-driven valuation change in the underlying holdings of our private equity partnership investments, partially offset by increases of $3.3 million in our real estate partnership investments, $2.7 million in our share of earnings of our joint venture investments in China and $0.5 million in certain other partnerships. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $5.8 million (19.5%) to $35.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $29.7 million). The increase in equity in earnings is driven by net increases in our share of the market-driven valuation increases in the underlying holdings of $8.5 million in our private equity partnership investments and $0.7 million in our real estate partnership investments, offset by decreases of the same nature of $1.9 million in our investment in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. and $1.5 million in certain other partnerships. Interest and dividend income and interest expense Interest and dividend income increased by $3.1 million ( 31.0% ) to $13.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 (year ended December 31, 2013 : $10.0 million ) due to higher dividends received from seed money. Interest expense increased by $28.5 million ( 63.9% ) to $73.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 (year ended December 31, 2013 : $44.6 million ) primarily due to the changes in long-term financing arrangements made during 2013 which increased the overall borrowing costs versus the comparative period. Interest and dividend income increased by $0.2 million (2.0%) to $10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $9.8 million). Interest expense decreased by $7.7 million (14.7%) to $44.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $52.3 million) primarily due to the changes in long-term financing arrangements made during 2012 which lowered the overall borrowing costs versus the comparative period. Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $28.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to a net gain of $2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 . Included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended December 31, 2014 is a net gain of $12.5 million resulting from the appreciation of investments held for our deferred compensation plans, a net gain of $4.0 million from other trading investments and net realized gains from available for sale and other investments of $12.9 million. These gains were offset by losses of $1.1 million from trading seed money and $ 0.2 million in net foreign exchange losses (year ended December 31, 2013 : $0.6 million in net foreign exchange losses) on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, - Note 14 , "Other Gains and Losses, Net" for additional information. Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to a net gain of $8.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 . Included within other gains and losses in the year ended December 31, 2013 is a net gain of $38.5 million resulting from the appreciation of investments held for our deferred compensation plans and net realized gains from available for sale and other investments of $5.0 million. These gains were offset by a realized loss of $6.6 million on the liquidation of a co-investment and sale of other securities together with a loss of $31.9 million recorded for a payment to a managed investment trust which resulted in the subsequent termination of an outstanding support agreement. A net loss of $1.8 million was also recorded in 2013 related to the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S Dollar foreign exchange rate. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , we experienced $0.6 million in net foreign exchange lo sses (year ended December 31, 2012 : $0.3 million in net foreign exchange gains) on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. 50 Table of Contents Other income/(expense) of CSIP In the year ended December 31, 2014 , other income/(expense) of CSIP, net totaled $ 24.3 million in income (year ended December 31, 2013: $2.9 million) and consists of $10.7 million of interest and dividend income and other net gains of $13.6 million (year ended December 31, 2013: $0.9 million and $2.0 million respectively). The increase in other income/(expense) of CSIP during 2014 is primarily attributable to a full year of activity being consolidated in 2014, whereas CSIP products were initially consolidated in the third quarter of 2013. The addition of third-party capital into CSIP products during 2014 and market performance also contributed to the increase. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 1 , "Accounting Policies" and 19 , Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, for additional details. Non-operating income and expense of CIP Interest income of CIP results from interest generated by the collateral assets held by consolidated CLOs, which is used to satisfy the interest expenses of the notes issued by the consolidated CLOs and other CLO operating expense requirements, including the payment of the management and performance fees to the company as investment manager. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. In the year ended December 31, 2014 , interest and dividend income of CIP increased by $16.5 million ( 8.7% ) to $206.5 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $190.0 million ). Interest expense of CIP increased by $10.6 million ( 8.6% ) to $133.9 million (year ended December 31, 2013 : $123.3 million ). The increase in interest income and interest expense of CIP in the 2014 period is due primarily to the impact of consolidation of CLO notes issued after September 30, 2013, exceeding the impact of deconsolidation and paydowns of CLO notes. Included in other gains/(losses) of CIP, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of CIP. In the year ended December 31, 2014 , other gains and losses of CIP were a net gain of $20.4 million , as compared to a net gain of $61.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 . The net gain in the 2014 period is primarily associated with an increase in market value of private equity investments exceeding losses associated with the increase in market value of the long-term debt of CLOs and the decrease in market value of CLO investments. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , interest and dividend income of CIP decreased by $68.5 million (26.5%) to $190.0 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $258.5 million) due primarily to the impact of the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain CLOs. Interest expense of CIP decreased by $45.0 million (26.7%) to $123.3 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $168.3 million), also primarily due to the impact of the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain CLOs. In the year ended December 31, 2013 other gains and losses of CIP were a net gain of $61.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 . The net gain in the 2013 period is primarily associated with an increase in market value of CLO and private equity investments exceeding losses associated with the increase in market value of the long-term debt of CLOs. Net impact of CIP and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities As illustrated in the Summary of Income Statement Impact of CIP table at the beginning of this Results of Operations section, the consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in an increase to net income of $11.1 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. Invesco invests in only a portion of these products, and as a result this net gain is offset by amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $3.3 million , resulting in a net increase in net income attributable to common shareholders of $7.8 million , representing the changes in the market value of the company's holding in its consolidated CLOs, which is reclassified into other gains/(losses) from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation. The consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted in an increase to net income of $36.0 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. This net gain is offset by amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests of $44.7 million, resulting in a net decrease in net income attributable to common shareholders of $8.7 million. The consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted in a decrease to net income of $100.5 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. This net loss is offset by amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of $89.8 million, resulting in a net decrease in net income attributable to common shareholders of $10.7 million. 51 Table of Contents Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in CIP. The impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments and debt of CIP attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources attributable to the company's common shareholders. Additionally, CIP represent less than 1% of the company's AUM. Therefore, the net gains or losses of CIP are not indicative of the performance of the company's aggregate assets under management. Income Before Taxes Total income before taxes includes income before taxes of CIP. CIP are taxed at the investor level and not at the product entity level; therefore, there is no tax provision reflected in the net impact of CIP. Accordingly, the table included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 , "Taxation," illustrating the division of income/(losses) before taxes between U.S. and Foreign is formatted such that the income before taxes of CIP is separately stated. The commentary below discusses disparities between U.S. and Foreign income before taxes in the Taxation footnote and U.S. and Foreign operating revenues in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17 , "Geographic Information." Total U.S. income before taxes of $722.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes income before taxes of CIP of $63.0 million , which primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships. U.S. income before taxes from CIP increased $17.8 million ( 39.4% ) from 2013 due primarily to greater investment gains generated by these private equity partnerships. Excluding CIP, U.S. income before taxes in 2014 increased $106.5 million ( 19.3% ). Income before taxes in 2014 increased due to a larger increase in U.S. operating revenues (9.1%) than operating expenses and other income and expenses (6.0%). Total Foreign income before taxes of $672.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes losses before taxes of CIP of $51.9 million , which primarily consists of losses from consolidated CLOs. Foreign CIP pre-tax losses totaled $51.9 million in 2014 compared to pre-tax losses of $9.2 million in 2013 due primarily to greater losses on investments held by the Company's consolidated CLOs in 2014 . Excluding CIP, foreign income before taxes increased by $58.3 million ( 8.8% ). Foreign income before taxes in 2014 increased due to a larger increase in Foreign operating revenues (12.3%) than operating expenses (11.4%); slightly offset by a decrease in Foreign other income. Total U.S. income before taxes of $598.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 ( December 31, 2012 : $516.3 million ) includes income before taxes of CIP of $45.2 million ( December 31, 2012 : $59.7 million ). U.S. income before taxes of CIP primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships and for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was a decrease of $14.5 million ( 24.3% ) from 2012 due primarily to lower gains generated by these private equity partnerships. Excluding CIP, U.S. income before taxes in 2013 increase d $ 96.5 million ( 21.1% ). Income before taxes in 2013 had a small decrease, contrary to the 13.2% increase in U.S. operating revenues, due primarily to a legal settlement gain recognized in 2012 . Total Foreign income before taxes of $656.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 ( December 31, 2012 : $314.3 million ) includes losses before taxes of CIP of $9.2 million ( December 31, 2012 : income before taxes of CIP of $160.2 million ). Foreign income in 2013 decreased more significantly than the 16.2% increase in Foreign operating revenues during the period due to increased foreign expenses incurred in 2013 , such as the $15.3 million additional distribution fee recorded in the U.K., as discussed above, and expenses incurred in connection with the outsourcing of the European transfer agency. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to 28.0% (year ended December 31, 2013 : 26.8% ). The inclusion of income from non-controlling interests increased our rate period-over-period by 0.6% ( 0.3% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2014 and 0.9% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2013 ). 2014 included rate increases of 0.5% as result of tax legislation changes in New York and of 0.6% as a result of the FCA settlement. Also included in 2014 were rate decreases of 0.5% as a result of the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and of 0.3% as a result of the fund reimbursement expense. The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased to 26.8% (year ended December 31, 2012 : 31.5% ) primarily due to income in non-controlling interests in 2013 versus losses in 2012 . The inclusion of non-controlling interests decreased our effective tax rate by 0.9% in 2013 and increased our rate 3.1% in 2012 . The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income. 52 Table of Contents Income from Discontinued Operations On December 31, 2013, the company completed the sale of Atlantic Trust. The operating results and the gain associated with the sale are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore excluded from the continuing operations of Invesco. Comparative periods shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income have been adjusted to conform with this presentation. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 22 , "Discontinued Operations." Schedule of Non-GAAP Information We are presenting the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)). We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency into our business on an ongoing operations basis and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, diluted EPS). Each of these measures is discussed more fully below. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. The tax effect related to reconciling items that are presented net of tax have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates. The following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS). Notes to the reconciliations follow the tables.

(1) Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments The company has two joint venture investments in China. The Invesco Great Wall joint venture is one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with AUM of approximately $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 . The company has a 49% interest in Invesco Great Wall. The company also has a 50% joint venture with Huaneng Capital Services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in China through Huaneng Invesco WLR Investment Consulting Company Ltd. Enhancing our operations in China is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. Accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business. Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from our Chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the company's Consolidated Financial Statements, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business. It is also consistent with the presentation 54 Table of Contents of AUM and net flows (where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected) and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on AUM. The company also has a joint venture in India which is not included in the proportional consolidation totals above due to the fact that it is not yet deemed significant to the company's operations at this stage of the investment, and, as a consequence, it is not included in the full array of the company's business planning and review processes. (2) Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , "Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" for additional details. While the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of AUM and the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP. Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM) and the related computation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company managed funds. Further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes. (3) CIP See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 - Consolidated Investment Products for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of CIP. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S. GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of CIP in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income. CIP Revenue: Year ended December 31, $ in millions, except per share data 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Management fees earned from CIP, eliminated upon consolidation 26.7 27.0 38.6 46.8 45.3 Performance fees earned from CIP, eliminated upon consolidation 9.1 11.3 2.4 0.5 Other revenues recorded by CIP (0.6 ) (0.4 ) (0.3 ) CIP related adjustments in arriving at net revenues 35.2 37.9 41.0 47.3 45.0 (4) Acquisition/disposition related adjustments Acquisition/disposition related adjustments include transaction and integration expenses, costs related to legal settlements of pre-acquisition matters, intangible asset amortization, including amortization related to the write-off of related 55 Table of Contents management contract intangible assets, changes in estimates of contingent earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions, employee severance expenses associated with the cessation of activities related to a previous acquisition, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co., tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and all related tax effects. While finite-lived intangible assets are amortized under U.S. GAAP, there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In certain qualifying situations, these can be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period, as is the case in the U.S. These cash flows (in the form of reduced taxes payable) represent tax benefits that are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business. The company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future, and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under U.S. GAAP is not expected to be used either through a credit in the Consolidated Statements of Income or through settlement of tax obligations. In addition, the results of the discontinued operations of Atlantic Trust have been excluded in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders, which is the basis of calculating adjusted diluted EPS. Accordingly, the company's non-GAAP financial measures reflect only the continuing business of Invesco. Management believes this presentation assists in evaluating the ongoing business performance and aids comparability with peer companies that may not have similar discontinued operations. Transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and the post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company existing operations, including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings. Additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closed-end funds included in a prior acquisition. Management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our Consolidated Financial Statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges, tax cash flow benefits and other acquisition/disposition related adjustments, as noted above, in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related charges. See table below for a reconciliation of acquisition/disposition related items: $ in millions 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Acquisition/disposition related: Employee compensation expense 2.4 15.0 20.0 Transaction and integration expense 3.2 8.2 29.4 150.0 Intangible amortization expense 12.6 15.4 25.5 35.5 21.8 Change in contingent consideration estimates (2.3 ) (13.2 ) (3.8 ) Other acquisition-related item 2.0 Adjustments to operating income 12.6 23.0 31.4 66.7 188.0 Gain on sale of CLO management contracts (8.3 ) Taxation: Taxation on transaction and integration (1.3 ) (3.1 ) (11.2 ) (46.9 ) Taxation on amortization (1.6 ) (1.5 ) (2.6 ) (4.4 ) (2.9 ) Deferred taxation 21.8 21.3 20.1 21.1 15.2 Taxation on change in contingent consideration estimates 1.3 Taxation on gain on sale of CLO management contracts 2.5 Taxation on other acquisition-related items (0.8 ) (Income)/loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes 3.4 (64.5 ) (18.1 ) (9.9 ) (6.6 ) Adjustments to net income attributable to common shareholders 36.2 (23.8 ) 21.9 62.3 148.1 56 Table of Contents (5) Market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities Certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically the funds managed by the employee. Invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet. U.S. GAAP requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. The full value of the investment appreciation (depreciation) is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. This creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted EPS which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. During periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-GAAP measures exclude the mismatch created by differing U.S. GAAP treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments. Since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. The related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period. Additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company Consolidated Statements of Income on the record dates. This dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. The non-GAAP measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense. 57 Table of Contents (6) Other reconciling items Each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from U.S. GAAP to arrive at the company's non-GAAP financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above, due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item, or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from U.S. GAAP in a prior period. $ in millions 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Other non-GAAP adjustments: Investment management fees accrual adjustment (a) 4.3 Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses - European infrastructure initiative (b) 2.7 15.3 Adjustments to net revenues 7.0 15.3 Business optimization charges: (c) Employee compensation 7.2 Property, office and technology 33.1 Regulatory charge (d) 31.1 Legal fees for regulatory charge (d) 0.5 Fund reimbursement expense (e) 31.1 U.K. FSCS levy (f) (4.7 ) 3.0 0.4 15.3 European infrastructure initiative (b) 7.8 20.3 18.8 Capitalized software development write-off (g) 11.7 Termination of stadium naming rights (h) (10.4 ) Fund accounting reimbursement costs (i) (0.3 ) 8.9 Litigation settlement costs (j) 3.6 Adjustments to operating income 98.3 29.5 35.6 12.1 24.2 Foreign exchange hedge (k) (0.2 ) (0.6 ) 0.8 Payment to an investment trust (l) 31.9 Senior notes call premium (m) 23.5 Litigation settlement credit (j) (45.0 ) Taxation: Taxation on investment management fees accrual adjustment (a) (1.1 ) Taxation on European infrastructure initiative (b) (2.1 ) (7.6 ) (1.9 ) Taxation on business optimization charges (c) (8.7 ) Taxation on legal fees (d) (0.1 ) Taxation on fund reimbursement expense (e) (11.7 ) Taxation on U.K. FSCS levy (f) 1.0 (0.7 ) (0.1 ) (4.3 ) Taxation on capitalized software development write-off (g) (4.3 ) Taxation on termination of stadium naming rights (h) 4.0 Taxation on fund accounting reimbursement costs (i) 0.1 (2.9 ) Taxation on litigation settlement credit (j) 15.6 Taxation on foreign exchange hedge (k) 0.2 (0.2 ) Taxation on payment to an investment trust (l) (12.1 ) Taxation on senior notes call premium (m) (5.8 ) Adjustments to net income attributable to common shareholders 78.6 40.7 46.3 (15.2 ) 17.0 58 Table of Contents a. During the three months ended December 31, 2013, the company reduced a management fee revenue accrual by $4.3 million to reflect a multi-year true-up. Inclusion of this true-up in the company non-GAAP financial information would depress the derived metric of net revenue yield on AUM from continuing operations, an important metric calculated from a non-GAAP financial measure which is often contemplated by users of the company financial information to evaluate the company with industry peers. The true-up is not indicative of a trend in future net revenue yield on AUM; therefore, it is not included in management evaluation of the results of the business. On this basis, the amount is added back to management fees to arrive at net revenue. b. European infrastructure transformational initiative: The company has outsourced its European transfer agency and has made certain structural changes to product and distribution platforms. Expenses incurred related to the European infrastructure activities are excluded in arriving at the non-GAAP financial information. In connection with the initiative, operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense in the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. c. Business optimization: Operating expenses for 2014 include property related charges of $33.1 million associated with vacating leased properties as part of a business optimization initiative and severance costs of $7.2 million related to the initiative. d. Operating expenses for 2014 include a charge of $31.1 million in respect of the penalty under a settlement of an enforcement proceeding reached with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) pertaining to the company's compliance with certain FCA rules and regulations for the period from May 2008 to November 2012. This charge, together with settlement-related legal costs of $0.5 million, has been recorded in general and administrative expense. e. General and administrative expenses for 2014 also include an expense of $5.3 million related to a fund reimbursement settlement cost and $25.8 million in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. The latter charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees. f. Included within general and administrative expenses for 2014 is a credit of $4.7 million related to the partial refund of a $15.3 million levy in 2010 from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme. An additional $0.4 million charge was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 and $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 reflecting revised estimates of the levy. g. Property, office and technology expenses includes a charge of $11.7 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2013 related to the write-off of capitalized IT software development costs. h. Included within marketing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $10.4 million related to the termination of naming rights to the Denver Broncos stadium. i. Included within general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2010 is a charge of $8.9 million representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds. A $0.3 million credit was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflecting the final amount reimbursed. j. Included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $45.0 million related to the settlement of litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor. Included within general and administrative expenses are legal fees associated with the litigation of $3.6 million. k. Included within other gains and losses, net is the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar foreign exchange rate. These contracts provided coverage through March 25, 2014. The adjustment from U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP earnings removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-GAAP results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period. l. On December 31, 2013, at the time of creating a new trust company subsidiary to continue operating the company institutional trust activities immediately following the disposition of Atlantic Trust, the company made a $31.9 million payment to a managed investment trust, which resulted in the subsequent termination of an outstanding support agreement. This expense was recorded in other gains/(losses) in the company Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended December 31, 2013. 59 Table of Contents m. Other gains and losses, net included a charge of $23.5 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2012 related to the call premiums on the redemption of the $333.5 million principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due February 27, 2013 and the $197.1 million principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes due December 15, 2014. Balance Sheet Discussion A summary of the balance sheet impact of CIP is presented below. The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on accounts receivable and investments for the year ended December 31, 2014 were reductions of $3.8 million and $94.9 million , respectively. This indicates that the consolidation of CIP reduced accounts receivable and investments by these amounts, reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the underlying net interests in CIP held by the company. The majority of the company CIP are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, if the CLOs were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. As demonstrated by the balance sheet data that follows in this section and in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section, inclusion of the long-term debt of consolidated investment products within liquidity measures, such as debt-to-equity measures, causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case. 60 Table of Contents Summary of Balance Sheet Impact of CIP December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 $ in millions Impact of CIP Consolidated Total Impact of CIP Consolidated Total ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents 1,514.2 1,331.2 Unsettled fund receivables 732.4 932.4 Accounts receivable (3.8 ) 545.9 (3.4 ) 500.8 Investments (94.9 ) 885.4 (55.3 ) 839.7 Assets of CSIP 305.8 108.5 Assets of CIP: Cash and cash equivalents of CIP 404.0 404.0 583.6 583.6 Accounts receivable of CIP 161.3 161.3 58.3 58.3 Investments of CIP 5,762.8 5,762.8 4,734.7 4,734.7 Assets held for policyholders 1,697.9 1,416.0 Prepaid assets 132.1 101.4 Other assets 92.0 182.1 Property and equipment, net 402.6 350.8 Intangible assets, net 1,246.7 1,263.7 Goodwill 6,579.4 6,867.3 Total assets 6,229.4 20,462.5 5,317.9 19,270.5 LIABILITIES Accrued compensation and benefits 667.3 676.4 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 757.3 763.1 Liabilities of CIP: Debt of CIP 5,149.6 5,149.6 4,181.7 4,181.7 Other liabilities of CIP 280.9 280.9 461.8 461.8 Policyholder payables 1,697.9 1,416.0 Unsettled fund payables 730.1 882.0 Long-term debt 1,589.3 1,588.6 Deferred tax liabilities, net 304.8 323.6 Total liabilities 5,430.5 11,177.2 4,643.5 10,293.2 TEMPORARY EQUITY Redeemable noncontrolling interests in CSIP 165.5 PERMANENT EQUITY Equity attributable to common shareholders: Common shares 98.1 98.1 Additional paid-in-capital 6,133.6 6,100.8 Treasury shares (1,898.1 ) (1,700.4 ) Retained earnings 20.3 3,926.0 12.5 3,361.9 Retained earnings appropriated for investors in CIP 17.6 17.6 104.3 104.3 Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax (20.2 ) 48.8 (12.7 ) 427.9 Total equity attributable to common shareholders 17.7 8,326.0 104.1 8,392.6 Equity attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 781.2 793.8 570.3 584.7 Total permanent equity 798.9 9,119.8 674.4 8,977.3 Total liabilities, temporary and permanent equity 6,229.4 20,462.5 5,317.9 19,270.5 61 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents increased by $183.0 million from $1,331.2 million at December 31, 2013 to $1,514.2 million at December 31, 2014 . See Cash Flows in the following section within this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the periods. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , Accounting Policies - Cash and Cash Equivalents, regarding requirements to retain liquid resources in certain jurisdictions. Unsettled fund receivables and payables Unsettled fund receivables decreased by $200.0 million from $932.4 million at December 31, 2013 to $732.4 million at December 31, 2014 , due primarily to lower t ransaction activity between funds and investors in late December 2014 when compared to late December 2013 in our UITs, together with U.K. and cross-border funds. In the company's capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and UITs in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled sell trades of UITs. In our U.K. and cross-border operations, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. The presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting payables ( $730.1 million at December 31, 2014 down from $882.0 million at December 31, 2013 ) at trade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company. Investments As of December 31, 2014 we had $885.4 million in investments. Included in investments are $314.4 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $162.6 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. Seed investments increased by $80.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 , due primarily to funding of seed money investments combined with positive market activity, partially offset by seed money redemptions. Investments held to hedge deferred compensation awards decreased by $87.1 million during the year, primarily due to redemptions of investments in affiliated funds to hedge economically employee plan awards, partially offset by new purchases of investments and positive market activity. Included in investments are $332.1 million in equity method investments in our Chinese and Indian joint ventures and in certain of the company private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other co-investments ( December 31, 2013 : $308.2 million ). The increase of $23.9 million in equity method investments was primarily driven by an increase of $20.1 million in our partnership investments. Partnership investments increased due to capital calls in co-investments of $44.9 million (including $39.4 million into real estate funds) and $18.2 million in earnings and valuation adjustments. These increases in partnership investments were offset by distributions and capital returns of $41.5 million and a $1.5 million decrease due to foreign exchange movement during the period. The remaining change in equity method investments is due to a $3.8 million increase in our joint venture investments. Our joint venture investments increased resulting from an increase in funding of $2.0 million and current period earnings of $24.1 million . These increases were offset by $18.1 million in dividends earned and $4.2 million in foreign exchange rate movement. Assets of CSIP Assets of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products (CSIP) consist of cash, investments and other assets. At December 31, 2014 , CSIP assets include $288.5 million in investments, $11.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $5.9 million in accounts receivable and other assets ( December 31, 2013 : $93.2 million in investments, $12.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $2.6 million in accounts receivable and other assets). The increase in the balance of these accounts was the result of additional capital contributions to these funds together with increases in market value of investments. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 , "Accounting Policies," and Note 19 , "Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products," for additional information. Assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables One of our subsidiaries, Invesco Perpetual Life Limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The increase in the balance of these accounts from $1,416.0 million at December 31, 2013 , to $1,697.9 million at December 31, 2014 , was the result of an increase in the market values of these assets and liabilities and net flows into the funds, offset by negative foreign exchange movements. 62 Table of Contents Intangible assets, net Intangible assets reflect a net decrease of $17.0 million from $1,263.7 million at December 31, 2013 , to $1,246.7 million at December 31, 2014 . The decrease in intangible assets, net is due to amortization of $12.6 million and foreign exchange movements of $4.4 million . Goodwill Goodwill decreased from $6,867.3 million at December 31, 2013 , to $6,579.4 million at December 31, 2014 . The decrease is due to foreign exchange movements of $ 287.9 million . See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 , "Goodwill," for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods. The company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. See Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill for additional details of the company's goodwill impairment analysis process. Long-term debt Long-term debt increased from $1,588.6 million at December 31, 2013 , to $1,589.3 million at December 31, 2014 , an increase of $ 0.7 million due to amortization of the difference between the public offering price and the par value that will be paid on maturity. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the company issued senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600.0 million at 4.000% due January 30, 2024 and $400.0 million at 5.375% due November 30, 2043. Of the total net proceeds, $699.4 million was used to repay the amount outstanding on the credit facility with the remaining to be used for general corporate purposes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Material changes in the company's capital structure over the last three years include: 2014 : During 2014, we repurchased 7.4 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $269.6 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program. 2013 : During the fourth quarter of 2013, the company issued senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600.0 million at 4.000% due January 30, 2024 and $400.0 million at 5.375% due November 30, 2043. Of the total net proceeds, $699.4 million was used to repay the amount outstanding on the credit facility with the remaining to be used for general corporate purposes. During 2013, we repurchased 13.9 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $470.5 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program. Additionally, the company amended its $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility to extend the maturity to 2018. 2012: In April of 2012 the company repaid the $215.1 million 5.625% senior notes utilizing borrowing from the company's credit facility and existing cash on hand. In November, the company issued an initial aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million of 3.125% senior notes due in November 2022. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to repay the $333.5 million 5.375% note due February 2013 and $197.1 million 5.375% note due December of 2014. In December, the company exercised the make-whole call option of these two notes paying a premium of $23.0 million to retire the debt early. The remaining proceeds from the issuance were used for general corporate purposes. During 2012, we repurchased 11.1 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $265.0 million in cash under the company's board approved open market share repurchase program. Our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include: reinvestment in the business; moderate annual growth of dividends (as further discussed in the "Dividends" section below); share repurchase; and establishment of an approximate $1 billion cash buffer in excess of regulatory requirements. These priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating. As of the date of this Report, Invesco held credit ratings of A/Stable and A2/Stable from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") 63 Table of Contents and Moody's, respectively. Furthermore, S&P considers our risk management to be strong. S&P rates companies' enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of Fair, Adequate, Strong, and Excellent. Our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. See also Item 1A - "Risk Factors," for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings. Certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. Such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance, and review from regulators. These and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. All of our regulated EU subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under EU Directives, including those arising from the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) and the United Kingdom's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. These requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources, which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. At December 31, 2014 , the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $937.6 million ( December 31, 2013 : $632.3 million ). We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. As of December 31, 2014 , the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $416.0 million (December 31, 2013: $282.0 million). The total amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents was $1,109.4 million at December 31, 2014 ( December 31, 2013 : $740.5 million ). In addition, the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its UIT broker dealer entity. At December 31, 2014 , these cash deposits totaled $11.4 million ( December 31, 2013 : $11.3 million ). The consolidation of $5.6 billion and $5.3 billion of total assets and long-term debt of certain CLO products as of December 31, 2014 , respectively, did not impact the company liquidity and capital resources. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, if the CLOs were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company.

Selected balance sheet information is reflected in the table below: Excluding CIP (Non-GAAP) (1) Including CIP (U.S. GAAP) $ in millions December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Cash and cash equivalents 1,514.2 1,331.2 835.5 1,514.2 1,331.2 835.5 Investments of CIP 5,762.8 4,734.7 4,550.6 Total assets (1) 14,233.1 13,952.6 12,640.9 20,462.5 19,270.5 17,492.4 Long-term debt 1,589.3 1,588.6 1,186.0 1,589.3 1,588.6 1,186.0 Long-term debt of CIP 5,149.6 4,181.7 3,899.4 Long-term debt / Long-term debt plus CIP debt 1,589.3 1,588.6 1,186.0 6,738.9 5,770.3 5,085.4 Total liabilities (1) 5,746.7 5,649.7 4,448.6 11,177.2 10,293.2 8,443.4 Total permanent equity (1) 8,320.9 8,302.9 8,192.3 9,119.8 8,977.3 9,049.0 Debt/Equity % (1,2) 19.1 % 19.1 % 14.5 % 73.9 % 64.3 % 56.2 % ____________ 64 Table of Contents (1) The balance sheet line items excluding CIP are non-GAAP financial measures. To calculate total assets excluding CIP at December 31, 2014 , use U.S. GAAP total assets of $20,462.5 million ( 2013 : $19,270.5 million ; 2012 : $17,492.4 million ) and subtract total assets of CIP of $6,229.4 million ( 2013 : $5,317.9 million ; 2012 : $4,851.5 million ). To calculate total liabilities excluding CIP at December 31, 2014 , use U.S. GAAP total liabilities of $11,177.2 million ( 2013 : $10,293.2 million ; 2012 : $8,443.4 million ) and subtract total liabilities of CIP of $5,430.5 million ( 2013 : $4,643.5 million ; 2012 : $3,994.8 million ). To calculate total permanent equity excluding CIP at December 31, 2014 , use U.S. GAAP total permanent equity of $9,119.8 million ( 2013 : $8,977.3 million ; 2012 : $9,049.0 million ) and subtract total equity of CIP of $798.9 million ( 2013 : $674.4 million ; 2012 : $856.7 million ). See the "Balance Sheet Discussion" section for a fully expanded balance sheet illustrating the impact of consolidation of investment products for 2014 and 2013 . (2) The debt-to-equity ratio excluding CIP is a non-GAAP financial measure. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as long-term debt divided by total permanent equity for the balance sheet excluding CIP and long-term debt plus long-term debt of CIP divided by permanent equity for the balance sheet including CIP. Management believes that it is important to illustrate for users of our Consolidated Financial Statements that calculating a balance sheet measure, such as the debt-to-equity ratio, including the impact of CIP causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case. As disclosed above, the debt of CIP is not the company's debt, nor do the noteholders of the CIP debt have any recourse to the company. Cash Flows Discussion The ability to consistently generate free cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and ongoing operating expenses is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products. Cash flows of CIP (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products ) are reflected in Invesco's cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIP is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its CIP. Accordingly, the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from CIP. The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was an addition of $11.1 million . This indicates that the consolidation of CIP increased consolidated net income by $11.1 million . Also as illustrated in the table below, the sum of the operating, investing and financing cash flows of CIP offsets to a zero impact to the company's change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period. The cash flows of CIP do not form part of the company cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted. The discussion that follows the table focuses on the company cash flows. 65 Table of Contents Summary of Cash Flow Statement Impact of CIP December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 $ in millions Impact of CIP Invesco Ltd.

In general, after allowing for the change in cash held by CIP, our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income. During 2014 , cash provided by operating activities increased $420.2 million to $1,200.4 million from $780.2 million in 2013 . As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP to cash provided by operating activities was $124.3 million of cash provided during 2014 compared to $284.1 million of cash used during 2013 . Excluding the impact of CIP, cash generated by operations was $1,076.1 million in 2014 compared to $1,064.3 million in 2013 , an increase of $11.8 million . This increase is lower than the $156.7 million increase in operating income principally due to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Excluding the impact of CIP, the changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $77.6 million of cash in 2014 , as compared to generating $30.5 million in the same period in 2013 , reducing cash provided by operating activities by $108.1 million when comparing the two periods. This includes a $8.1 million increase in net purchases of trading investments, an $11.4 million decrease in cash held by CSIP investments, and $54.6 million of additional payroll payments related to annual staff bonus, related payroll taxes, payroll taxes on annual share award vestings, and annual retirement plan contributions. There were no significant non-cash items that impacted the comparison between the periods of operating income to net cash provided by operations. Net income during 2014 includes $13.6 million of gains from CSIP investments ( 2013 : $2.0 million ). These gains are adjusted out in arriving at cash provided by operations. During 2013 , cash provided by operations, excluding the impact of CIP, increased $192.2 million to $1,064.3 million from $872.1 million in 2012 . Cash provided by operations in 2013 benefited from higher net income from continuing operations. The increase was partially offset by the lower realization in 2013 of receivables balances into cash, when compared to 2012 . This includes the realization into cash in 2012 of a $45.0 million litigation related receivable. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,827.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 ( 2013 : net cash used $239.9 million ). As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP on investing activities, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, was $1,520.0 million used ( 2013 : $32.7 million used ). Excluding the impact of CIP cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $307.2 million ( 2013 : net cash used of $207.2 million ). For the year ended December 31, 2014 , excluding the impact of CIP, cash outflows include purchases of investments by CSIP of $683.4 million (2013: $116.5 million ) and available-for-sale investments and other investments of $329.2 million ( 2013 : $438.6 million ). These outflows were partially offset by collected proceeds of $493.6 million from sale of investments by CSIP ( 2013 : $66.9 million ), $284.2 million from sales and returns of capital of available-for-sale and other investments ( 2013 : $234.1 million ), and $60.8 million received during 2014 as part of the final consideration for the sale of the Atlantic Trust business on December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014 , the company had capital expenditures of $133.2 million ( 2013 : $88.2 million ). Our capital expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives, including enhancements to platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software, desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each year, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. These projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $239.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 ( 2012 : net cash used of $82.4 million ). As shown in the tables above, CIP, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, used $32.7 million ( 2012 : $77.3 million contributed ). Excluding CIP cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $207.2 million ( 2012 : net cash used of $159.7 million ). Net investment purchases and sales, increased by $220.1 million to $292.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $72.2 million in 2012 due to an increase in seed money and CSIP transactions during 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2012 net investments included $16.4 million due to the sale of CLO management contracts. Net cash inflows during the year included net cash proceeds of $137.0 million collected from the sale of Atlantic Trust completed on December 31, 2013. Cash inflows also include collected proceeds of $301.0 million from sales and returns of capital of investments (2012: $184.0 million ). 67 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $862.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 ( 2013 : cash used of $59.3 million ). As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP on financing activities provided cash of $1,395.7 million during the year ( 2013 : cash provided of $316.8 million ). Excluding the impact of CIP, financing activities used cash of $533.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 ( 2013 : cash used of $376.1 million ). Financing cash outflows during the year ended December 31, 2014 included $424.0 million of dividend payments for the dividends declared in January, April, July and November 2014 ( 2013 : dividends paid of $379.7 million ) and the purchase of shares through market transactions totaling $269.6 million ( 2013 : $470.5 million ). Financing cash inflows during 2013 included net cash proceeds of $981.5 million received upon the completion of the issuance of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600.0 million at 4.000% due January 30, 2024 and $400.0 million at 5.375% due November 30, 2043. The proceeds were used, in part, to repay the outstanding balance of $586.5 million on the credit facility. Other financing cash inflows in 2014 include net cash of $161.1 million invested into CSIP by third-party investors (2013: $3.9 million ), cash received from the exercise of options of $11.0 million ( 2013 : $17.9 million ) and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $24.0 million ( 2013 : $21.6 million ). Financing cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2012 included the repayment of the $215.1 million 5.625% senior notes utilizing borrowing from the company's credit facility and existing cash on hand. In addition, during 2012, the company issued an initial aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million of 3.125% senior notes due November 2022. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to repay the $333.5 million 5.375% note due February 2013 and $197.1 million 5.375% note due December of 2014. Dividends Invesco declares and pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. The 2014 quarterly dividend was $0.25 per Invesco Ltd. common share. On January 29, 2015 , the company declared a fourth quarter 2014 cash dividend, which will be paid on March 6, 2015 , to shareholders of record as of February 19, 2015 with an ex-dividend date of February 17, 2015 . The total dividend attributable to the 2014 fiscal year of $1.00 per share represented a 11.1% increase over the total dividend attributable to the 2013 fiscal year of $0.90 per share. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts. Share Repurchase Plan In October 2013, the board of directors authorized $1.5 billion for the share repurchase program with no stated expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2014 , the company repurchased 7.4 million shares in the market at a cost of $269.6 million (three months ended December 31, 2014 : 1.2 million shares at a cost of $50.0 million ; year ended December 31, 2013 : 13.9 million shares at a cost of $470.5 million ). Separately, an aggregate of 2.1 million shares were withheld on vesting events during the year ended December 31, 2014 to meet employees' withholding tax obligations ( December 31, 2013 : 2.4 million ). The fair value of these shares withheld at the respective withholding dates was $73.3 million ( December 31, 2013 : $64.9 million ). Approximately $1,226.8 million remained authorized under the company's share repurchase plan at December 31, 2014 ( December 31, 2013 : $1,496.5 million ). 68 Table of Contents Long-term debt Our long-term debt at December 31, 2014 was $ 1,589.3 million ( December 31, 2013 : $ 1,588.6 million ) and was comprised of the following: $ in millions December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Floating rate credit facility expiring December 17, 2018 Unsecured Senior Notes: $600 million 3.125% - due November 30, 2022 599.6 599.6 $600 million 4.000% - due January 30, 2024 596.2 595.8 $400 million 5.375% - due November 30, 2043 393.5 393.2 Long-term debt 1,589.3 1,588.6 For the year ended December 31, 2014 , the company's weighted average cost of debt was 4.01% (year ended December 31, 2013 : 2.49% ). The unsecured $1.25 billion credit agreement is scheduled to expire on December 17, 2018. Financial covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25 : 1.00 , (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00 : 1.00 . As of December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At December 31, 2014 , our leverage ratio was 0.98 :1.00 ( December 31, 2013 : 1.05:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 22.74 :1.00 ( December 31, 2013 : 35.49:1.00). The December 31, 2014 and 2013 coverage ratio calculations are as follows: Last four quarters ended $ millions December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Net income attributable to common shareholders 988.1 940.3 Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders arising from CIP (7.8 ) 8.7 Tax expense 388.7 373.3 Amortization/depreciation/impairment 89.4 100.1 Interest expense 73.1 44.6 Share-based compensation expense 138.0 133.1 Unrealized gains and losses from investments, net * (7.3 ) (17.4 ) EBITDA ** 1,662.2 1,582.7 Adjusted debt ** $1,627.5 $1,655.2 Leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA - maximum 3.25:1.00) 0.98 1.05 Interest coverage (EBITDA/Interest Expense - minimum 4.00:1.00) 22.74 35.49 ____________ * Adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our credit facility, may also include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures. ** EBITDA and Adjusted debt are non-GAAP financial measures; however management does not use these measures for anything other than these debt covenant calculations. The calculation of EBITDA above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to common shareholders) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to common shareholders is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to EBITDA. The calculation of Adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $1,589.3 million plus $38.2 million in letters of credit. The discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. The Executive Overview of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management. 69 Table of Contents Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation. The company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business: All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of December 31, 2014 , our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $1,514.2 million . See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21 , Related Parties, for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds. Certain subsidiaries of the company accept deposits and place deposits with other institutions on behalf of our customers. As of December 31, 2014 , our exposure to credit risk related to these transactions is $2.4 million . The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $1,589.3 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog. Effects of Inflation Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of AUM. Off Balance Sheet Commitments See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 , Commitments and Contingencies - Off Balance Sheet Commitments, for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments. Contractual Obligations We have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of December 31, 2014 : $ in millions Total (4,5,6) Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (1) 1,589.3 1,589.3 Estimated interest payments on long-term debt (1) 1,001.5 64.3 128.5 128.5 680.2 Operating leases (2) 528.3 71.6 132.7 117.8 206.2 Purchase obligations (3) 152.4 79.4 14.3 11.4 47.3 Total 3,271.5 215.3 275.5 257.7 2,523.0 70 Table of Contents ____________ (1) Long-term debt includes $1,589.3 million of fixed rate debt. Fixed interest payments are reflected in the table above in the periods they are due, and include any issuance discounts. The table above includes the company's debt; debt of CIP is excluded from the table above, as the company is not obligated for these amounts. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products," for additional information. (2) Operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and other assets. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 , Operating Leases for sublease information. (3) In the ordinary course of business, Invesco enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of Invesco. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent fixed-price contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2014 , the company's obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. In addition, the company is a party to certain variable-price contractual arrangements (e.g. contingent future payments based on AUM levels, number of accounts, transaction volume, etc.) for which the company is reimbursed by affiliated funds and as such are not included in the table above. Purchase obligations are recorded as liabilities in the company's Consolidated Financial Statements when services are provided. (4) The company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2014 , the company's undrawn capital and purchase commitments were $158.8 million . These are not included in the above table. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 , Commitments and Contingencies for additional details. (5) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 , the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $6.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 - Taxation for a discussion regarding income taxes. (6) In addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, we periodically make contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 we contributed $15.9 million and $15.3 million , respectively, to these plans. In 2015, we expect to contribute $15.2 million to our defined benefit pension plans and none to our postretirement medical plan. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 , Retirement Benefit Plans for detailed benefit pension and postretirement plan information. The company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , Accounting Policies." The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below; however, the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these Consolidated Financial Statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future. 71 Table of Contents Taxation We operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. Deferred tax assets, net of any associated valuation allowance, have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, the company considers the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, among other factors. The company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the Consolidated Financial Statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. If it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense. See also Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - in Note 15, "Taxation," for additional discussion of these items. Goodwill Our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2014 and 2013 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary; however, the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $6,579.4 million and $6,867.3 million at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , respectively. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company's AUM, or any other material negative change in AUM and related management fees. The October 1, 2014 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2013 annual impairment test. Fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including AUM growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. The 2014 annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions, including the company's updated forecasts for changes in AUM due to market gains and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. Market gains are based upon historical returns of the S&P 500 index, treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns, as applicable to the company's AUM mix on the testing date. The most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. The most significant changes in assumptions from 2013 related to a decrease in the equity risk premium and a decrease in beta coefficient (market participant average), which resulted in a discount rate of 11.1% for the October 1, 2014 analysis ( 2013 : 13.6%). The discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments. 72 Table of Contents Intangible Assets Where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible). In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense from continuing operations, which was $12.6 million , $15.4 million and $25.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including AUM growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the AUM growth rate and discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums. Changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. In 2014 and 2013 , annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates, the classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived remain appropriate, and no changes to the expected lives of the definite-lived intangible assets were required. Investments A significant portion of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments, or directly to earnings, in the case of trading assets. Since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. Fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. The accuracy of our other-than-temporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. Seed money investments are held in Invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods. These investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments. The value of investments may decline for various reasons. The market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company. Such declines require further investigation by management, which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment, including, but not limited to, the following factors: The probability that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition; The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; The intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; The decline in the security's value due to an increase in market interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates since acquisition; Determination that the security is not realizable; or An adverse change in estimated cash flows of a beneficial interest. Our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of available for sale seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment. As part of the review, we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one-, three-, and five-year historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets. We also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date, the trend of the losses, and percent declines in values of the seed money investments. Along with intent and ability to hold, all of these scenarios are considered as part of our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings. 73 Table of Contents We also assess our equity method and other investments for impairment. If circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, a more detailed impairment analysis is performed which includes assessing many of the factors listed above. CIP Assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) or voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are VIEs. Determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE also requires significant judgment, as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns (for investment products other than CLOs) involves estimation and probability assumptions. For CLOs, there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the CLOs economic results and to assess if the company's interests could be deemed significant. If current financial statements are not available for consolidated VIEs or VOEs, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. Significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by CIP and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the other gains and losses of CIP, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2014 , the company consolidated VIEs that held investments of $5,116.9 million ( December 31, 2013 : $4,277.7 million ) and VOE fund investments of $730.2 million ( December 31, 2013 : $512.2 million). As circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of VIE and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of VOEs. Estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain CIP; however, changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests. Contingencies Contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. We must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. The nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. We expense any related legal fees as they are incurred. Management's judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities, if applicable. Contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.
