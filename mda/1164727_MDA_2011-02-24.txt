Overview Newmont is one of the world largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and the Fortune 500, and was the first gold company included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold and gold/copper properties. We have significant assets and/or operations in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico. Our vision is to be the most valued and respected mining company through industry leading performance. In 2010, we have successfully executed on the key benchmarks that we set out at the beginning of the year. 41 Table of Contents Delivered strong operating performance. Consolidated gold production of approximately 6.5 million ounces (5.4 million ounces attributable to Newmont) at Costs applicable to sales of $485 per ounce; Consolidated copper production of approximately 600 million pounds (327 million pounds attributable to Newmont) at Costs applicable to sales of $0.80 per pound; Record Sales of $9,540, an increase of 24% over 2009; Gold operating margin (average realized price less consolidated Costs applicable to sales ) of $737 per ounce in 2010, an increase of 30% over 2009 compared to an increase of 25% in the average realized gold price for the same period; Record Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders of $4.63 per share, basic; Record Cash flow from continuing operations of $3,180, an increase of 9% over 2009; and Net increase of 1.7 million ounces of gold reserves to 93.5 million ounces at December 31, 2010. Advanced the development of our project pipeline. Akyem, Ghana In January 2010 we received the mining lease from the Ghanaian government. We continue to progress into the development stage with an emphasis on project engineering and obtaining all required land access and permits. In 2010, we selected and mobilized the project engineering procurement and construction contractor, and we are advancing the project towards a construction decision in the first half of 2011. If all permits are secured on the currently articulated schedule, we expect this project to commence production in late 2013 or early 2014. At December 31, 2010, we reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves at Akyem; Conga, Peru Feasibility studies on our preferred option were completed in late 2009 and we continue to progress into the development stage with an emphasis on project engineering and obtaining all required permits. In 2010, we selected and mobilized the project engineering procurement and construction contractor. In October 2010, the project Environmental Impact Assessment was approved by the Peruvian authorities. A construction decision is expected in the first half of 2011. If all permits are secured, production is expected to commence in late 2014 or early 2015. At December 31, 2010 we reported 6.1 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,660 million attributable pounds of copper reserves at Conga; and Hope Bay, Nunavut, Canada Hope Bay is an 80 kilometer district in the Canadian arctic and is one of the last known undeveloped greenstone belts in the world. The exploration success over the last few years continues to confirm the district significant long-term potential.

Implemented Business Excellence initiatives to further drive continuous improvement and business efficiencies throughout our organization. Continuing to improve our safety performance; Applying trained resources to identify and realize cost reductions, value creation and operational efficiencies; Maintaining our industry-leading environmental, social and community relations commitments; Remaining a leading member of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index; and Investing in people and innovation. 42 Table of Contents Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance The table below highlights key financial and operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Sales $ 9,540 $ 7,705 $ 6,124 Income from continuing operations $ 3,144 $ 2,109 $ 1,147 Net income $ 3,116 $ 2,093 $ 1,160 Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 2,277 $ 1,297 $ 831 Per common share, basic Income from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 4.69 $ 2.68 $ 1.80 Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 4.63 $ 2.66 $ 1.83 Adjusted net income (1) $ 1,893 $ 1,359 $ 792 Adjusted net income per share (1) $ 3.85 $ 2.79 $ 1.74 Gold ounces produced (thousands) Consolidated 6,451 6,521 6,153 Attributable to Newmont (2) 5,392 5,237 5,201 Copper pounds produced (millions) Consolidated 600 504 285 Attributable to Newmont 327 227 128 Gold ounces sold (thousands) Consolidated 6,296 6,534 6,150 Attributable to Newmont 5,274 5,217 5,089 Copper pounds sold (millions) Consolidated 539 507 290 Attributable to Newmont 292 226 130 Average price realized, net (3) Gold (per ounce) $ 1,222 $ 977 $ 874 Copper (per pound) $ 3.43 $ 2.60 $ 2.59 Costs applicable to sales (4) Gold (per ounce) $ 485 $ 411 $ 429 Copper (per pound) $ 0.80 $ 0.64 $ 1.38 (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 72. (2) Includes production from discontinued operations of 32 and 76 ounces in 2009 and 2008, respectively. (3) After treatment and refining charges. (4) Consolidated Costs applicable to sales excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . Consolidated Financial Performance Sales increased 24% in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher average realized gold and copper prices and higher consolidated copper pounds sold, partially offset by fewer consolidated gold ounces sold. The average realized gold price increased 25% to $1,222 per ounce in 2010 from $977 per ounce in 2009. The average realized copper price, including $120 favorable mark to market adjustments on provisionally priced copper sales and net of treatment and refining charges, increased 32% to $3.43 per pound in 2010 compared to $2.60 per pound in 2009. Copper pounds sold increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher production at Batu Hijau and a full year of ramp-up 43 Table of Contents production at Boddington. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher concentrates held in inventory at December 31, 2010 and lower production in North and South America, partially offset by higher production in Asia Pacific, primarily Boddington. Costs applicable to sales increased 16% in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a full year of Boddington production and higher waste mining and milling costs, partially offset by lower gold sales volumes, higher by-product credits and a build-up of inventories and stockpiles. In addition, the effective income and mining tax rate was lower in 2010 due to $440 in benefits resulting from income tax planning for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Liquidity Our financial position was as follows: At December 31, 2010 2009 Debt (including current portion) $ 4,441 $ 4,809 Newmont stockholders equity $ 13,345 $ 10,703 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,056 $ 3,215 Investments (including current portion) $ 1,681 $ 1,242 During 2010, our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Net cash provided from continuing operations of $3,180; Capital expenditures of $1,402; Income and mining taxes paid of $1,185; Proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau shares to noncontrolling interests of $229; Debt pre-payment of $368; Pension and other benefit contributions of $163; Acquisition of additional 17% Batu Hijau economic interest from noncontrolling interests for $110; Dividends paid to common shareholders of $246; and Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $462. Looking Forward We will continue to focus on operational and project excellence in 2011 to deliver on our plans and continue the advancement of our project pipeline, resulting in the following expectations for 2011: Attributable gold production of approximately 5.1 to 5.3 million ounces, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau as it moves into Phase 6 stripping, partially offset by higher production at Nevada and Ahafo; Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold of $560 to $590 due to lower production at Batu Hijau combined with higher costs for energy, labor and contracted services; Attributable copper production of approximately 190 to 220 million pounds at Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold of approximately $1.25 to $1.50; We expect to close the Fronteer acquisition for approximately C$2,300 in the second quarter; Consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $2,700 to $3,000 in 2011, with approximately 40% to be spent on major project initiatives, including further development of the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru, the Hope Bay project in Canada and the Nevada project portfolio. The remaining 60% is expected to be spent on several expansion and 44 Table of Contents optimization projects, routine replacements, new project development and other mine life extension efforts; Exploration expense of approximately $335 to $345; and Advanced projects, research and development expense of approximately $405 to $415. Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Our 2011 expectations, particularly with respect to production volumes and Costs applicable to sales per ounce or pound, may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year results due to variations in mine planning and sequencing, ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity input prices and foreign currency exchange rates; and Potential future investments in the Hope Bay project in Canada, the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru and the Long Canyon project in Nevada to be acquired from Fronteer will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. Accounting Developments For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the 45 Table of Contents estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Stockpiles Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at each stockpile average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper in the stockpile. Stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and processed further. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our stockpiles had a total carrying value of $1,786 and $1,387, respectively. The following is a summary of our ore stockpiles: At December 31, At December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 ($ in millions) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada $ 324 $ 269 $ 175 $ 150 Yanacocha 69 32 167 167 Boddington 192 46 348 189 Other Australia/New Zealand 145 121 308 282 Batu Hijau 142 133 172 140 Ahafo 121 72 307 252 Total/Weighted Average $ 993 $ 673 $ 220 $ 173 46 Table of Contents At December 31, At December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 ($ in millions) ($ per pound) Copper Boddington $ 56 $ 13 $ 0.95 $ 0.51 Batu Hijau 737 701 0.47 0.38 Total/Weighted Average $ 793 $ 714 $ 0.49 $ 0.38 Costs that are incurred in or benefit from the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles. We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ( NRV ), and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and actual production levels. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2010 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a long-term gold price of $1,100 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.90 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the stockpiles decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV. During 2008, we recorded a write-down of stockpiles to NRV of $2. Cost allocation to stockpiles and the NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Carrying Value of Ore on Leach Pads Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad. Estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2010 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation included a long-term gold price of $1,100 per ounce. If short-term and long-term metals prices 47 Table of Contents decrease, the value of the ore on leach pads decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to NRV. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our leach pads had a total carrying value of $588 and $518, respectively. The following is a summary of our ore on leach pads: At December 31, At December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 ($ in millions) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada $ 155 $ 176 $ 431 $ 362 La Herradura 6 5 526 450 Yanacocha 427 337 558 357 Total/Weighted Average $ 588 $ 518 $ 517 $ 360 Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future cash flows for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2010 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $1,100 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.00 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.90 per A$1.00. During 2008, we recorded an impairment of $120 to reduce the carrying value of property, plant and mine development as part of Write-down of property, plant and mine development . Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. 48 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. Changes in the fair market value of derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated income, except for the effective portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair market value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. The derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against future foreign currency expenditures or future diesel expenditures, where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that such future foreign currency or diesel expenditures are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated income immediately. Reclamation and Remediation Obligations Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine site in accordance with guidance for accounting for asset retirement obligations. Reclamation obligations for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Income and Mining Taxes We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above to Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. 49 Table of Contents Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If an estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income and mining tax expense . Consolidated Financial Results Gold Sales increased $1,306 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a $245 per ounce increase in the average realized price after treatment and refining charges, partially offset by 238,000 fewer ounces sold. Gold Sales increased $1,014 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a $103 per ounce increase in the average realized price after treatment and refining charges and 384,000 additional ounces sold. For a complete discussion regarding variations in gold volumes, see Results of Consolidated Operations below.

The following analysis reflects the changes in consolidated copper sales: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Consolidated copper sales: Gross before provisional pricing $ 1,842 $ 1,283 $ 878 Provisional pricing mark-to-market gain 120 173 (47 ) Gross after provisional pricing 1,962 1,456 831 Less: Treatment and refining charges (114 ) (137 ) (79 ) Net $ 1,848 $ 1,319 $ 752 Consolidated copper pounds sold (millions) 539 507 290 Average realized copper price (per pound): Gross before provisional pricing $ 3.42 $ 2.53 $ 3.03 Provisional pricing mark-to-market gain 0.22 0.33 (0.16 ) Gross after provisional pricing 3.64 2.86 2.87 Less: Treatment and refining charges (0.21 ) (0.26 ) (0.28 ) Net $ 3.43 $ 2.60 $ 2.59 The change in consolidated copper sales is due to: 2010 vs. 2009 vs. 2009 2008 Increase in consolidated pounds sold $ 88 $ 623 Increase in average realized copper price 418 2 Decrease (increase) in treatment and refining charges 23 (58 ) $ 529 $ 567 51 Table of Contents The following is a summary of consolidated gold and copper sales, net: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Gold North America: Nevada $ 2,111 $ 1,943 $ 1,929 La Herradura 217 113 83 2,328 2,056 2,012 South America: Yanacocha 1,778 2,013 1,613 Asia Pacific: Boddington 834 101 Batu Hijau 776 550 261 Kalgoorlie 463 329 264 Jundee 416 413 342 Tanami 311 280 321 Waihi 131 116 123 2,931 1,789 1,311 Africa: Ahafo 655 528 435 Corporate and other 1 7,692 6,386 5,372 Copper Asia Pacific: Batu Hijau 1,686 1,292 752 Boddington 162 27 1,848 1,319 752 $ 9,540 $ 7,705 $ 6,124 Costs applicable to sales for gold increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a full year of Boddington production and higher mining and milling costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher by-product credits and a build-up of inventories and stockpiles. The increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to higher sales volumes and higher royalty and workers participation costs, partially offset by higher by-product sales and lower diesel costs. Costs applicable to sales for copper increased in 2010 from 2009 due to higher production and waste mining costs at Batu Hijau and a full year of Boddington production. The decrease in 2009 from 2008 was due to lower diesel and mining costs, partially offset by higher labor costs and the start-up of Boddington production. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. Amortization expense increased in 2010 from 2009 due to a full year of Boddington production, additional equipment purchases and higher capitalized mine development. Amortization expense increased in 2009 from 2008 due to the start-up of Boddington, higher underground production at Nevada and Jundee, development of North Lantern in Nevada, a full year amortization of Hope Bay infrastructure and higher production at Batu Hijau. Amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease due to the use of the units-of-production amortization method for mineral interests and mine development. For a 52 Table of Contents complete discussion, see Results of Consolidated Operations , below. We expect Amortization expense to be approximately $1,025 to $1,035 in 2011. The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales and Amortization by operation: Costs Applicable to Sales Amortization Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Gold North America: Nevada $ 974 $ 1,019 $ 993 $ 271 $ 261 $ 246 La Herradura 73 42 38 19 11 8 1,047 1,061 1,031 290 272 254 South America: Yanacocha 630 642 637 162 168 170 Asia Pacific: Boddington 400 45 113 15 Batu Hijau 155 118 124 42 30 25 Kalgoorlie 211 210 231 15 15 16 Jundee 132 136 149 33 49 34 Tanami 173 174 207 43 47 39 Waihi 69 57 55 17 25 33 1,140 740 766 263 181 147 Africa: Ahafo 237 242 205 78 68 63 3,054 2,685 2,639 793 689 634 Copper Asia Pacific: Batu Hijau 337 307 399 90 78 80 Boddington 93 16 25 4 430 323 399 115 82 80 Other Hope Bay 13 12 1 Asia Pacific 2 3 3 Corporate and other 22 20 20 37 35 24 $ 3,484 $ 3,008 $ 3,038 $ 945 $ 806 $ 738 Exploration expense increased to $218 in 2010 from $187 in 2009 due to additional near mine expenditures in all regions, with the largest increase in Nevada at Leeville/Turf and Midas. Exploration expense decreased in 2009 from $213 in 2008 due to a reduced drilling program related to our focus on net cash flow generation and a more selective and strategic exploration program. We expect Exploration expense to be approximately $335 to $345 in 2011. During 2010, we added 8.2 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.5 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions of 8.2 million ounces were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Leeville (1.8 million ounces), Ahafo (1.5 million ounces), Twin Creeks (1.4 million ounces), Phoenix (0.8 million ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million ounces) and Tanami 53 Table of Contents (0.7 million ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in the United States, Australia and South America (1.8 million ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 0.5 million ounces at Akyem in Ghana, primarily due to new mining assumptions and higher cutoff grades. The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million ounces. During 2009, we added 6.4 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.8 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions of 6.4 million ounces were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Gold Quarry (2.9 million ounces), Boddington (1.3 million ounces), Tanami (0.5 million ounces) and Ahafo (0.5 million ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in Australia and South America (0.6 million ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 0.3 million ounces at Phoenix in Nevada, primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts. The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million ounces. During 2008, we added 5.2 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.7 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions from exploration of 4.4 million ounces were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Boddington (1.6 million ounces, 66.67% ownership), with most of the remaining additions coming from several open pit and underground sites in Nevada (totaling 1.2 million ounces) and from underground sites in Australia (0.7 million ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 1.1 million ounces, primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts at Phoenix in Nevada. The impact of the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was an increase of 1.9 million ounces. Advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and certain drilling costs. Advanced projects, research and development expense increased 60% in 2010 compared to 2009 due to additional spending at Hope Bay and increased spending to accelerate internal growth opportunities across our portfolio. Significant projects include the Hope Bay gold project in Nunavut, Canada, the Subika underground and Akyem gold projects in Ghana and the Conga copper and gold project in Peru. We expect Advanced projects, research and development expense to be approximately $405 to $415 in 2011, with a focus on the major projects above. Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Major projects: Hope Bay $ 74 $ 25 $ 39 Subika underground 11 2 Conga 8 4 4 Akyem 5 8 7 Boddington 25 3 Other projects: Technical and project services 49 24 23 Corporate 29 14 15 Other 40 33 75 $ 216 $ 135 $ 166 General and administrative expense increased to $178 in 2010 compared to $159 in 2009 due to higher benefit and compensation costs. General and administrative expense increased in 2009 compared to $144 in 2008 due to higher benefits, mainly pension and other post retirement costs. General and administrative expense as a percentage of Sales was 1.9% in 2010, compared to 2.1% and 2.4% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We expect General and administrative expense to be approximately $190 to $200 in 2011. 54 Table of Contents Write-down of property, plant and mine development totaled $6, $7 and $137 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 write-down primarily related to asset disposals in North America and Asia Pacific. The 2009 write-down primarily related to asset disposals in Asia Pacific and South America. The 2008 write-down primarily related to mineral interests and other assets in North America and Asia Pacific. In North America, the Fort a la Corne JV assets were impaired based on 2008 geologic results and potential project economics leading to our decision to cease funding our share of project development costs. Other expense, net was $261, $358 and $240 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in 2010 over 2009 is due to costs related to acquiring the remaining interest in Boddington, higher charges related to the Western Australian power plant, and a workforce reduction that impacted 3% of our global workforce in 2009, partially offset by higher community development costs at Batu Hijau in 2010. The increase in 2009 over 2008 is due to costs related to acquiring the remaining interest in Boddington in 2009, the workforce reduction that impacted 3% of our global workforce and an increase in expenses for the Western Australian power plant, partially offset by the recovery of provision for doubtful accounts expensed in 2008. Other income, net was $109, $88 and $123 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 over 2009 is primarily related to an increase in Canadian Oil Sands Trust distributions due to higher oil prices in 2010 and sales of non-core assets, partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses. The decrease in 2009 over 2008 is primarily related to a decrease in Canadian Oil Sands Trust distributions due to lower oil prices in 2009 and higher gains on sale of investments and exploration properties in 2008, partially offset by the other-than-temporary investment impairment in 2008. Interest expense, net was $279, $120 and $135 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $21, $111 and $47 in each year, respectively. Interest expense, net increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the reduction in capitalized interest as Boddington achieved commercial production in November 2009 and interest related to the 2019 and 2039 senior notes issued during September 2009, partially offset by lack of interest due to the prepayment in 2010 of the PTNNT project financing and Yanacocha senior notes and credit facility. Interest expense, net decreased in 2009 from 2008 due to higher capitalized interest related to the higher construction investments at Boddington, partially offset by additional interest on the senior notes issued in September 2009 and convertible senior notes issued in February 2009. We expect Interest expense, net to be approximately $235 to $245 in 2011. Income and mining tax expense was $856, $829 and $142 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rates were 21%, 28% and 11% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 and 2008 is primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of check the box elections made with respect to certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of the elections, the subsidiaries are treated as flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The restructurings in 2010 resulted in the recording of a deferred tax asset, calculated as the difference between fair market valuations of the subsidiaries compared to the underlying financial statement basis in the assets. The restructuring in 2008 resulted in a significant loss that allowed us to recover income taxes paid in prior years. Without the restructuring, the effective tax rate for 2010 and 2008 would have been 32% and 24%, respectively. Although the 2010 tax benefit from the restructuring was much larger than the amount in 2008 ($440 as opposed to $159), the impact to the overall effective tax rate was diluted due to the large pretax book income for that year. The factors that most significantly impacted our effective tax rates for the three periods are percentage depletion, changes in estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties and the impact of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. For a complete discussion, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the 55 Table of Contents effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 32% in 2011. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Batu Hijau $ 549 $ 445 $ 98 Yanacocha 292 354 232 Other (2 ) (3 ) (1 ) $ 839 $ 796 $ 329 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2010 from 2009 as a result of higher earnings at Batu Hijau and the required March 2010 divestiture of Batu Hijau, partially offset by lower earnings at Yanacocha and the additional 17% economic interest in Batu Hijau as a result of advancing funds to certain noncontrolling partners in exchange for their share of Batu Hijau dividends, net of withholding tax (for a complete discussion see Results of Consolidated Operations below). The 2009 increase over 2008 resulted from increased earnings at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha and divestiture of a portion of Batu Hijau in accordance with the provisions of the Contract of Work. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in our Batu Hijau ownership. Equity income (loss) of affiliates was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 AGR Matthey Joint Venture $ 3 $ 5 $ (2 ) Regis Resources Ltd. (3 ) Minera La Zanja S.R.L. 10 (4 ) Euronimba Ltd. (10 ) (17 ) $ 3 $ (16 ) $ (5 ) The AGR Matthey Joint Venture ( AGR ) was dissolved in 2010. Our interest in Regis Resources Ltd. ( Regis Resources ) was diluted in 2009 to a level where we no longer account for our interest in Regis Resources pursuant to the equity method. In 2008, Newmont purchased additional shares of European Gold Refineries ( EGR ) resulting in our consolidation of EGR. In 2009, we began accounting for our investments in Minera La Zanja S.R.L. (46.94%) and Euronimba Ltd. (43.5%) on the equity method. Income (loss) from discontinued operations was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Sales $ $ 32 $ 75 Income (loss) from operations: Kori Kollo $ $ 1 $ (9 ) Other 6 1 (3 ) Non-operating gain (loss) (40 ) (44 ) 1 Pre-tax income (loss) (40 ) (43 ) (2 ) Income tax benefit 12 27 15 Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ (28 ) $ (16 ) $ 13 56 Table of Contents Discontinued operations include Kori Kollo sold in July 2009 and various other operations sold to third parties. In December 2010, we recognized a $28 charge, net of tax benefits, for legal claims related to historic operations previously sold to third parties. In July 2009, we sold our interest in Kori Kollo in Bolivia. As part of the transaction, a reclamation trust fund was established with the proceeds to be made available exclusively for closure and reclamation cost funding when operations eventually cease. We recognized a $16 charge in 2009, net of tax benefits, related to the sale. Other comprehensive income, net of tax was $484 in 2010 and included non-cash adjustments for a $269 net gain in value of marketable securities, a $98 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $13 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments and a $130 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Other comprehensive income, net of tax was $882 in 2009 and included non-cash adjustments for a $418 net gain in value of marketable securities, a $264 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $14 net gain related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments and a $186 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Other comprehensive loss, net of tax was $1,212 in 2008 and included a $573 net loss in value of marketable securities, a $387 net loss on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $130 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments and a $122 net loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.

(3) Includes 32 and 76 thousand ounces from discontinued operations at Kori Kollo, Bolivia in 2009 and 2008, respectively. 57 Table of Contents 2010 compared to 2009 Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased slightly due to: lower production from South America due to mine sequencing resulting in increased waste mining, lower leach placement and lower mill ore grade; and lower production from North America due to completion of mining at Deep Post in 2009 and geotechnical issues at Gold Quarry; mostly offset by higher production from Asia Pacific due to a full year of Boddington production and higher ore grade and throughput at Batu Hijau; and higher production from Africa due to higher ore grade. Consolidated copper pounds produced increased 19% due to higher ore grade and throughput at Batu Hijau and a full year of Boddington production. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 18% due to lower production from South America, a full year of higher cost production at Boddington and higher diesel, royalty and waste mining costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold increased 25% due to higher waste mining at Batu Hijau and a full year of higher cost production at Boddington, partially offset by higher production at Batu Hijau. 2009 compared to 2008 Consolidated gold ounces produced increased 6% due to: higher production from Asia Pacific primarily as a result of higher ore grade and throughput at Batu Hijau and the start-up of Boddington; and higher production from South America as a result of higher grade and throughput at the Yanacocha mill; partially offset by lower production from North America due to lower grade and lower leach placement in Nevada. Consolidated copper pounds produced increased 77% due to higher ore grades and throughput at Batu Hijau and the start-up of Boddington. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold decreased 4% due to higher production, lower diesel costs and higher by-product credits partially offset by higher royalties and workers participation costs. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold decreased 54% due to higher copper production, lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau, lower diesel costs and a lower co-product allocation of costs to copper at Batu Hijau. We expect 2011 gold production of approximately 5.1 to 5.3 million ounces attributable to Newmont, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau as it moves into Phase 6 stripping, partially offset by higher production at Nevada and Ahafo. Consolidated Costs applicable to sales per ounce for 2011 are expected to be approximately $560 to $590 due to lower production at Batu Hijau combined with higher costs for energy, labor and contracted services. We expect 2011 copper production attributable to Newmont of approximately 190 to 220 million pounds at consolidated Costs applicable to sales per pound of approximately $1.25 to $1.50 due to lower production at Batu Hijau. 58 Table of Contents North America Operations Gold Ounces Produced Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Amortization 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Nevada 1,735 1,986 2,260 $ 565 $ 509 $ 447 $ 157 $ 130 $ 111 La Herradura (2) 174 113 95 420 372 397 110 95 86 Total/Weighted-Average 1,909 2,099 2,355 $ 551 $ 501 $ 445 $ 153 $ 128 $ 110 Attributable to Newmont 1,909 2,099 2,355 (1) Consolidated Costs applicable to sales excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . (2) Our proportionately consolidated 44%. 2010 compared to 2009 Nevada, USA. Gold ounces produced decreased 13% due to the completion of underground mining at Deep Post in 2009, lower Gold Quarry ore mined as a result of a geotechnical issue which occurred in December 2009 and lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin, partially offset by increased underground mining at Leeville. Total ore tons mined were 26% lower primarily due to the Gold Quarry slope failure and the completion of mining at North Lantern in April 2010. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 62% to 4.5 million tons. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 11% due to lower production, partially offset by higher by-product credits. Amortization per ounce increased 21% due to lower production and higher underground development costs. La Herradura, Mexico. Gold ounces produced increased 54% due to the commencement of commercial production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits in January 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 13% due to higher waste tons mined. Amortization per ounce increased 16% due to new equipment purchases. 2009 compared to 2008 Nevada, USA. Gold ounces produced decreased 12% due to lower mill ore grades from Leeville as well as the completion of mining at Deep Post and mine sequencing changes at Gold Quarry resulting in lower leach placement. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 40% to 11.9 million tons, primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry, partially offset by the start-up of North Lantern. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 14% due to lower production and higher underground mining costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs and higher by-product credits. Amortization per ounce increased 17% due to lower production, higher underground development costs and a full year of power plant operations. La Herradura, Mexico. Gold ounces produced increased 19% due to higher leach placement. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 6% due to higher production and lower fuel costs. Amortization per ounce increased 10% due to new equipment purchases. Gold production for North America in 2011 is expected to be approximately 2.0 to 2.1 million ounces at Costs applicable to sales per ounce of approximately $560 to $600. Production from Nevada operations have been impacted by the December 2009 geotechnical event at Gold Quarry, limiting access to ore originally scheduled to be mined in 2010 and 2011. During 2010, we mined through the impacted area and expect to reestablish access to ore in the first half of 2011. 59 Table of Contents South America Operations Gold Ounces Produced Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Amortization 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Yanacocha (51.35% owned) (2) 1,462 2,058 1,809 $ 431 $ 310 $ 346 $ 111 $ 81 $ 92 Attributable to Newmont (3) 771 1,057 929 (1) Consolidated Costs applicable to sales excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation .

Gold ounces produced decreased 29% due to mine sequencing resulting in increased waste mining, lower leach placement, transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua and lower grade and recovery resulting in lower mill production. Leach tons placed decreased from 136 million tons to 59 million tons. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 39% due to higher waste material mined, lower production, higher labor, diesel and maintenance costs, and higher workers participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices, partially offset by higher by-product credits. Amortization per ounce increased 37% due to lower production. 2009 compared to 2008 Yanacocha, Peru. Gold ounces produced increased 14% as higher ore grade and recovery resulted in higher mill production, partially offset by lower leach production due to longer recovery times. Ore placed on the leach pads increased to 136 million tons from 98 million tons at a consistent grade of 0.018 ounces per ton. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 10% due to lower waste material mined, higher production, lower diesel costs and higher by-product credits, partially offset by higher workers participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices. Amortization per ounce decreased 12% due to higher production. Gold production for South America in 2011 is expected to be approximately 715,000 to 775,000 ounces attributable to Newmont, due to lower leach production at Yanacocha. Costs applicable to sales per ounce are expected to increase in 2011 to approximately $500 to $550, primarily due to lower gold production and higher contracted services and supplies. 60 Table of Contents Asia Pacific Operations Gold Ounces Produced Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Amortization 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Gold Boddington 728 122 $ 590 $ 468 $ $ 166 $ 160 $ Batu Hijau (2)(3) 737 560 269 237 214 414 63 55 85 Other Kalgoorlie (4) 377 337 306 558 624 760 41 43 52 Jundee 335 411 378 393 331 395 99 120 91 Tanami 250 289 367 689 599 567 170 160 108 Waihi 108 113 144 647 481 390 156 215 234 1,070 1,150 1,195 546 499 541 101 117 103 Total/Weighted-Average 2,535 1,832 1,464 $ 474 $ 410 $ 515 $ 109 $ 100 $ 99 Attributable to Newmont (5) 2,167 1,517 1,316 Copper Pounds Produced Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Amortization 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) ($ per pound) ($ per pound) Copper Boddington 58 10 $ 1.86 $ 1.77 $ $ 0.51 $ 0.46 $ Batu Hijau (2)(3) 542 494 285 0.69 0.62 1.38 0.19 0.16 0.28 Total/Weighted-Average 600 504 285 $ 0.80 $ 0.64 $ 1.38 $ 0.21 $ 0.16 $ 0.28 Attributable to Newmont 327 227 128 (1) Consolidated Costs applicable to sales excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . (2) Consolidated gold ounces and copper pounds produced includes noncontrolling interests share. (3) Our weighted-average economic interest based on copper production was 49.55%, 43.89% and 45.00% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in our ownership of Batu Hijau. (4) Our proportionately consolidated 50%. (5) Includes 5 thousand ounces in 2010 from our non-consolidated interest in Duketon. Boddington, Australia. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper at Costs applicable to sales of $590 per ounce ($487 on a by-product basis; see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 72) and $1.86 per pound on a co-product basis. As Boddington continued to ramp-up in 2010, production was below original expectations due to lower than anticipated gold grade and mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales were higher than expected due to higher mining and mill maintenance costs. Amortization per ounce was higher than expected due to lower production. 2010 compared to 2009 Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Copper and gold production increased 10% and 32%, respectively, due to higher grade and mill throughput as a result of mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and processing softer ore, partially offset by lower recovery. Unseasonably dry weather permitted additional mining in the bottom of Phase 5 during the fourth quarter. Beginning in 2011, we expect to process primarily stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill feed commencing in late 2013. Costs applicable to sales increased 11% per pound and per ounce due to higher waste mining and milling 61 Table of Contents costs, including higher labor and diesel costs. Amortization increased 19% per pound and 15% per ounce due to higher equipment additions, partially offset by higher production. Other Australia/New Zealand. Gold production decreased 7% due to lower mill grade at Jundee and Waihi and lower mill grade and throughput at Tanami, partially offset by higher grade, throughput and recovery at Kalgoorlie. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% due to lower production and a weaker U.S. dollar. Changes in Australia and New Zealand exchange rates increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce by $33. Amortization per ounce decreased 14% due to lower mine development costs at Waihi and Jundee, partially offset by lower production. 2009 compared to 2008 Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Consolidated copper pounds and gold ounces produced increased 73% and 108%, respectively, due to higher mill throughput, grade and recovery due to processing higher grade Phase 5 ore compared to ore sourced primarily from lower grade and harder ore stockpiles in 2008. Costs applicable to sales decreased 55% per pound and 48% per ounce due to higher production. Costs applicable to sales per ounce also decreased due to a higher co-product allocation of costs to copper due to a higher realized copper price. Amortization decreased 43% per pound and 35% per ounce due to higher production. Other Australia/New Zealand. Gold ounces produced decreased 4% due to lower throughput as a result of unplanned mill maintenance and lower grade at Tanami and a temporary suspension of milling operations due to an electrical fire at Waihi, partially offset by higher throughput and grade at Jundee and higher throughput, grade and recovery at Kalgoorlie. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 8% due to lower diesel prices, partially offset by lower production, a stronger Australian dollar and higher royalties. Amortization per ounce increased 14% due to lower production, a higher mix of underground production at Jundee and a shortened mine life adjustment at Tanami. Gold production for Asia Pacific is expected to decrease in 2011 to approximately 1.9 to 2.0 million ounces attributable to Newmont at higher consolidated Costs applicable to sales per ounce of approximately $600 to $675 in 2011, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau. We expect copper production for the Asia Pacific region of approximately 190 to 220 million pounds attributable to Newmont at consolidated Costs applicable to sales per pound of approximately $1.25 to $1.50 in 2011.

Gold ounces produced increased due to higher grade ore mined at Apensu in 2010 and the commencement of production at Amoma in October 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased slightly due to higher labor, power, diesel and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production. Amortization per ounce increased 20% due to higher capitalized mine development and equipment additions. 2009 compared to 2008 Ahafo, Ghana. Gold ounces produced increased due to higher throughput, partially offset by lower mill recovery. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% due to higher labor, contracted 62 Table of Contents services, maintenance and power costs, partially offset by lower diesel prices. Amortization per ounce decreased slightly as higher production was offset by equipment additions. Gold production for the Africa operations is expected to be approximately 550,000 to 590,000 ounces in 2011 due to mining higher ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce of approximately $485 to $535 are expected for 2011, primarily as a result of higher energy prices and higher labor and royalty costs. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates In addition to our domestic operations in the United States, we have operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana and other foreign locations. Our operations sell their production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 36%, 24% and 27% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our Costs applicable to sales are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. Variations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce $10, net of hedging, in 2010 compared to 2009, and decreased Costs applicable to sales per ounce $6, net of hedging, in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to movements in the Australian dollar. We hedge a portion of our forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. At December 31, 2010, we have hedged 72%, 45% and 22% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, at an average rate of 0.82, 0.84 and 0.84, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill. 63 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Provided from Operations Net cash provided from continuing operations was $3,180, $2,914 and $1,397 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and was impacted by the following key factors: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Consolidated gold ounces sold (in thousands) 6,296 6,534 6,150 Average price received per ounce of gold, net (1) $ 1,222 $ 977 $ 874 Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold sold (2) $ 485 $ 411 $ 429 Consolidated copper pounds sold (in millions) 539 507 290 Average price received per pound of copper, net (1) $ 3.43 $ 2.60 $ 2.59 Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper sold (2) $ 0.80 $ 0.64 $ 1.38 (1) After treatment and refining charges. (2) Excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . Net cash provided from continuing operations was a record $3,180 in 2010, an increase of $266 from 2009 due to higher realized gold and copper prices of $1,569 and $418, respectively, and increased consolidated copper sales volume of $88; partially offset by decreased gold sales volume of $234, as discussed above in Consolidated Financial Results. The increase was also partially offset by higher costs applicable to sales of $476, primarily from a full year of Boddington operations, higher interest expense of $159, higher current income and mining tax expense of $408, and an additional $527 investment in working capital (trade receivables, inventories, stockpiles and ore on leach pads). Cash flow provided from operations during 2009 was $2,914, an increase of $1,517 from 2008 due to higher realized gold prices of $690 and increased gold and copper sales volume of $337 and $623, respectively, as discussed above in Consolidated Financial Results and a $400 lower investment in working capital. The increase was partially offset by lower distributions from the Canadian Oil Sands Trust of $84 and higher current income and mining tax expense of $370. We are currently planning to contribute $18 to our retirement benefit programs in 2011. For additional discussion see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2010, November 2009 and December 2009, Nusa Tenggara Partnership ( NTP ) completed the sale of 7%, 10% and 7% of shares in PTNNT to a third party buyer, respectively. These transactions reduced our direct ownership interest in PTNNT to 31.5%. Cash proceeds from the 2010 and 2009 sales were $229 and $638, respectively, with our 56.25% share being $129 and $359, respectively, and the remaining balances paid to our NTP partner. Acquisition of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests. On June 25, 2010, P.T. Pukuafu Indah ( PTPI ), an unrelated noncontrolling partner of PTNNT, completed the sale of approximately a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama ( PTIMI ). To enable the transaction to proceed, we released our rights to the dividends payable on this 2.2% interest and released our security interest in the associated shares. We further agreed to advance certain funds to PTIMI to enable it to purchase the interest in exchange for an assignment by PTIMI to us of the dividends 67 Table of Contents payable on the 2.2% interest (net of withholding tax), a pledge of the shares as security for the loan and certain voting rights and obligations. The funds that we advanced to PTIMI and which it paid to PTPI for the shares were used by PTPI to reduce its outstanding loan balance with us. Upon completion of this transaction, PTPI requested and was allowed to make additional draw-downs under our agreement with PTPI. Our economic interest in PTPI and PTIMI combined 20% interest in PTNNT remains at 17% and has not changed as a result of these transactions. On December 22, 2009, we entered into a transaction with PTPI whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for a pledge of the noncontrolling partner 20% share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax, certain voting rights and obligations and a commitment from PTPI to support the application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. As a result, our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17%. In connection with the above transaction, we advanced additional funds to PTPI during 2010. Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests. We paid dividends of $462, $394 and $389 to noncontrolling interests during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The dividends paid in 2010 and 2009 included $100 and $279, respectively, for our NTP partner share of the interest sold in Batu Hijau during those years. Dividends paid to common stockholders.

Additionally, Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, paid annual dividends of C$0.52, C$0.46 and C$0.43 during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. On February 23, 2011, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, payable March 30, 2011 to holders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2011. Total dividends paid to common stockholders were $246, $196 and $182 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Discontinued Operations Net operating cash provided from (used in) discontinued operations was $(13) in 2010, compared to $33 and $(104) in 2009 and 2008, respectively, as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Kori Kollo $ (13 ) $ 33 $ 7 Income taxes and other (111 ) $ (13 ) $ 33 $ (104 ) During 2008, we made tax payments of $153 related to the December 2007 royalty portfolio sale. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was $11 in 2008 and included accrued expense payments on the royalty portfolio sale of $11 and additions to property, plant and mine development of $5 at Kori Kollo partially offset by proceeds of $5 from the sale of other former mining assets. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations was $2 and $4 in 2009 and 2008, respectively, for repayment of debt at Kori Kollo. Corporate Revolving Credit Facility The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit sub-facility. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the lead bank prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving 68 Table of Contents credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the facility fees were 0.07% of the commitment. There was $153 and $452 outstanding under the letter of credit sub-facility at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, $nil was borrowed under the facility. Debt Covenants The Company senior notes, and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant debt facilities contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income and mining taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring us to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults. Shelf Registration Statement In September 2009, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 4-5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Debt (1) $ 5,288 $ 418 $ 1,510 $ 340 $ 3,020 Capital lease obligations (1) 194 41 144 9 Reclamation and remediation obligations (2) 1,654 61 185 118 1,290 Employee-related benefits (3) 601 89 116 90 306 Uncertain income tax liabilities and interest (4) 36 36 Operating leases 113 26 49 16 22 Minimum royalty payments 389 28 83 55 223 Purchase obligations (5) 958 197 245 110 406 Other (6) 387 85 282 12 8 $ 9,620 $ 945 $ 2,614 $ 750 $ 5,311 69 Table of Contents (1) Amounts represent principal ($4,441) and estimated interest payments ($1,041) assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation and remediation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefits include severance, workers participation, pension funding and other benefit plans. Pension plan funding beyond 2015 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. (4) We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments beyond 2011 due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. (5) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (6) Other includes accrued Boddington contingent consideration of $83 and other obligations which are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements including labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as disclosed in the above table) and $1,191 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We also have sales agreements to sell copper and gold concentrates at market prices as follows (in thousands of tons): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Batu Hijau 420 440 430 518 Boddington 226 254 243 254 231 672 Nevada 61 75 707 769 673 772 231 672 For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. Future Cash Flows We anticipate significant future capital expenditures (see Investing Activities, above), funding of exploration and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and noncontrolling interests will impact Net cash used in investing activities and Net cash used in financing activities and exceed Net cash provided by operations . Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. Although we currently carry a large cash balance, we may determine that it may be necessary or appropriate to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing 70 Table of Contents stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 3, 2011, we announced an agreement with Fronteer Gold, Inc. ( Fronteer ) to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Fronteer. Fronteer shareholders will receive C$14.00 in cash and one common share of Pilot Gold Inc., a Canadian Corporation, which will retain certain exploration assets of Fronteer, for each common share of Fronteer. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011 for approximately C$2,300. Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized prices of gold and copper. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided by operations to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian dollar. Accordingly, we have entered into derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of Costs applicable to sales in Asia Pacific. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided from operations to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Net cash provided from operations will also be impacted in 2011 as a result of planned contributions of $18 for our post-retirement benefit programs. Based on expected attributable production of between 5.1 and 5.3 million ounces of gold and between 190 and 220 million pounds of copper in 2011, we do not anticipate reasonably expected variations in our production profile alone to influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations in 2011. Environmental Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $904 and $698, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing mineral properties, of which $46 is classified as a current liability. For more information on the Company reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $144 and $161 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We spent $23, $20 and $39 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and have classified $18 as a current liability. Expenditures for 2010 related primarily to the Con mine in Canada which was acquired as part of the Miramar acquisition, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, which is a legacy Normandy site, the Dawn mill site and Resurrection, a mine site in Leadville, Colorado. Expenditures for 2009 related primarily to Grass Valley in California, the Mt. Leyshon property, the Dawn mill site in Washington State and the Con mine. Expenditures for 2008 related primarily to Resurrection as well as the Mt. Leyshon property. For more information on the Company obligations associated with former mining activities, see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 71 Table of Contents Included in capital expenditures were $118, $131 and $231 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of Costs applicable to sales . Forward-Looking Statements The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1, Business. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income Management of the Company uses Adjusted net income to evaluate the Company operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets, including marketable securities and goodwill. Management determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 2,277 $ 1,297 $ 831 Income tax planning and other, net (391 ) (159 ) Net gain on asset sales (39 ) (16 ) (47 ) PTNNT community contribution 13 Impairment of assets 4 8 182 Boddington contingent consideration 1 15 Boddington acquisition costs 44 Discontinued operations loss (income) 28 11 (15 ) Adjusted net income $ 1,893 $ 1,359 $ 792 Adjusted net income per share, basic $ 3.85 $ 2.79 $ 1.74 Adjusted net income per share, diluted $ 3.79 $ 2.79 $ 1.74 By-product costs applicable to sales Revenue and Costs applicable to sales for Boddington are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements for both gold and copper due to the significant portion of copper production (approximately 15-20% of total revenue based on the latest life-of-mine plan and metal price assumptions). The co-product method allocates costs applicable to sales to each metal based on specifically identifiable costs where applicable and on a relative proportion of revenue values for other 72 Table of Contents costs. Management also assesses the performance of the Boddington mine on a by-product basis due to the majority of revenues being derived from gold and to determine contingent consideration payments that may be paid to AngloGold for the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington. The by-product method deducts copper revenue from costs applicable to sales as shown in the following table: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Co-product costs applicable to sales gold $ 400 $ 45 Less copper margin: Sales copper 162 27 Costs applicable to sales copper (93 ) (16 ) 69 11 By-product costs applicable to sales gold $ 331 $ 34 Costs applicable to sales gold ($ per ounce) Co-product $ 590 $ 468 By-product $ 487 $ 352 Gold ounces sold (in thousands) 679 95
