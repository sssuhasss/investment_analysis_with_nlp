ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop differentiated food products and market these value-added products under unique brand names. We work continuously on product innovation to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our businesses are organized into three reportable segments. U.S. Retail reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, specialty stores and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our major product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, meals, refrigerated and frozen dough products, baking products, snacks, yogurt and organic foods. Our International segment is made up of retail businesses outside of the United States, including a retail business in Canada that largely mirrors our U.S. Retail product mix, and foodservice businesses outside of the United States and Canada. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment consists of products marketed throughout the United States and Canada to retail and wholesale bakeries, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, and convenience stores. Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. In the most recent fiscal year, our total return to stockholders, including stock price appreciation and dividends, was 7.2 percent, while the S&P 500 Index returned 8.8 percent; from fiscal 2001 to 2006, our total return to stockholders averaged 6.8 percent per year while the S&P 500 Index posted a 1.8 percent average annual return over the same period. Our long-term growth objectives are: low single-digit average annual growth in net sales; mid-single-digit average annual growth in total segment operating profit (see page 25 for our discussion of this measure not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)); and high single-digit average annual growth in earnings per share (EPS). 12 Table of Contents These measures, combined with an attractive dividend yield and improvement in return on capital, drive the management of our business. For the fiscal year ended May 28, 2006, our net sales grew 4 percent and total segment operating profit grew 5 percent, in line with our long-term goals. Diluted EPS decreased 6 percent in fiscal 2006; however, excluding the EPS effects of our convertible debentures in both fiscal years and the fiscal 2005 net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs, our diluted EPS grew 8 percent, in line with our long-term goal (see page 24 for our discussion of this measure not defined by GAAP). Our net cash provided by operations increased to nearly $1.8 billion in 2006, enabling us to: increase our annual dividend payments by 8 percent from fiscal 2005; continue to return cash to stockholders via share repurchases, which totaled $885 million in fiscal 2006; and repay $189 million of debt. We continued to reinvest in the long-term growth in our brands, increasing advertising by 8 percent from fiscal 2005, and we also continued to make significant capital investments to support future growth and productivity, as we spent $360 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2006. Finally, our return on average total capital improved by 60 basis points (see page 25 for our discussion of this measure not defined by GAAP). Results for fiscal 2006 were negatively impacted by increased fuel and commodity costs and higher advertising spending. Details of our financial results are provided in the Fiscal 2006 Consolidated Results of Operations section below. As we begin fiscal 2007, we have momentum in several of our key businesses. We must sustain that momentum and restore net sales growth in two operating units that did not grow in fiscal 2006 Big G cereals and Pillsbury USA. We plan to launch new products, achieve competitive levels of retailer merchandising activity and increase advertising in Big G cereals in fiscal 2007. In Pillsbury USA, we plan to launch new products and focus consumer marketing support to improve product mix. We expect our worldwide food business to achieve another year of good sales and operating profit growth. We also intend to deliver more growth from new products and accelerate our performance in fast-growing channels such as drug stores, dollar stores and club formats. Finally, we plan to expand our margins by focusing on realizing price increases, managing our input costs, and achieving productivity through supply chain and administrative cost-saving efforts. We expect our fiscal 2007 interest expense to be $40 million higher than in fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher interest rates. We also expect the impact of the adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation to reduce earnings by $0.11 to $0.12 per diluted share in fiscal 2007, and we expect our effective tax rate to increase 75 to 125 basis points over the fiscal 2006 effective rate of 34.5 percent. FISCAL 2006 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For fiscal 2006, we reported diluted EPS of $2.90, down 6 percent from $3.08 per share earned in fiscal 2005. Excluding the effects of our convertible debentures in both fiscal years and excluding the fiscal 2005 net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs, diluted EPS increased 8 percent from $2.75 in fiscal 2005 to $2.98 in fiscal 2006. Earnings after tax were $1,090 million in fiscal 2006, down 12 percent from $1,240 million in fiscal 2005, reflecting the net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs in fiscal 2005. Net sales for fiscal 2006 grew 4 percent to $11.6 billion, driven by 2 percentage points of unit volume growth, primarily in U.S. Retail and International, and 1 percentage point of growth from pricing and product mix across many of our businesses. Promotional spending and foreign currency exchange effects were flat compared to fiscal 2005. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Unit Volume Growth +2 pts Price/Product Mix/Foreign Currency Exchange +1 pt Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense Flat Net Sales Growth +4% Table does not add due to rounding. Cost of sales was up $132 million in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005, primarily due to unit volume increases, as manufacturing efficiencies largely offset cost increases due to inflation. Also, the year-over-year change in cost of sales was favorably impacted by the following costs incurred in fiscal 2005: $18 million in expense from accelerated depreciation associated with exit activities, as described below; and $5 million of product recall costs. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales decreased from 60.8 percent in fiscal 2005 to 59.9 percent in fiscal 2006. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased by $260 million in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005. SG&A as a percent of net sales increased from 21.5 percent in fiscal 2005 to 23.0 percent in fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A from fiscal 2005 was largely the result of a $97 million increase in domestic employee benefit costs, including incentives; an $86 million increase in customer freight expense, primarily due to increased fuel costs; a $46 million increase in consumer marketing spending; and $23 million of increases in our environmental reserves. Net interest expense for fiscal 2006 totaled $399 million, lower than interest expense for fiscal 2005 of $455 million, primarily as the result of debt pay down and the maturation of interest rate swaps. Interest expense includes preferred 13 Table of Contents distributions paid on subsidiary minority interests. We have in place an amount of interest rate swaps that convert $500 million of fixed-rate debt to floating rates. Taking into account the effect of our interest rate swaps, the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt and subsidiary minority interests was 6.4 percent at May 28, 2006, compared to 5.4 percent at May 29, 2005. In fiscal 2006, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $30 million, consisting of $13 million related to the closure of our Swedesboro, New Jersey frozen dough plant; $6 million primarily for severance costs associated with the restructuring of our frozen dough plant in Montreal, Quebec; $4 million of restructuring costs at our Allentown, Pennsylvania frozen waffle plant, primarily related to product and production realignment; $3 million associated with an asset impairment charge in one of our plants; and $4 million primarily associated with fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives. In fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $84 million, consisting of $44 million of charges associated with fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives; $30 million of charges related to relocating our frozen baked goods line from our Boston plant; $3 million of charges primarily associated with Bakeries and Foodservice severance; and $7 million of charges associated with restructuring actions prior to fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives were undertaken to further increase asset utilization and reduce manufacturing and sourcing costs, resulting in decisions regarding plant closures and production realignment. The actions included decisions to: close our flour milling plant in Vallejo, California; close our par-baked bread plant in Medley, Florida; relocate bread production from our Swedesboro, New Jersey plant; relocate a portion of our cereal production from Cincinnati, Ohio; close our snacks foods plant in Iowa City, Iowa; and close our dry mix production at Trenton, Ontario. The effective income tax rate was 34.5 percent for fiscal 2006, reflecting the benefit of $11 million of adjustments to deferred tax liabilities associated with our International segment brand intangibles. In fiscal 2005 our effective income tax rate was 36.6 percent, driven primarily by the tax impacts of our fiscal 2005 divestitures. Earnings after tax from joint ventures totaled $64 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $89 million in fiscal 2005. Earnings from joint ventures in fiscal 2005 included $28 million from our Snack Ventures Europe (SVE) joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., which was divested on February 28, 2005. In fiscal 2006, unit volume for Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), our joint venture with Nestl S.A., grew 6 percent and net sales were up 4 percent. In February 2006, CPW announced a restructuring of its manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom. Our after-tax earnings from joint ventures was reduced by $8 million for our share of the restructuring costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and severance, incurred in fiscal 2006. Our share of the remainder of CPW restructuring costs is expected to affect our after-tax earnings from joint ventures in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia declined 7 percent from fiscal 2005 due to an unseasonably cold winter and increased competitive pressure in Japan. 8th Continent, our joint venture with DuPont, achieved 14 percent net sales growth in fiscal 2006. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 30 million from fiscal 2005. This was due primarily to the repurchase of a significant portion of our contingently convertible debentures in October 2005 and the completion of a consent solicitation related to the remaining convertible debentures in December 2005, actions that ended the dilutive accounting effect of these debentures in our EPS calculations. In addition, we repurchased 19 million shares of our stock during fiscal 2006, partially offset by the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises. FISCAL 2005 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings per diluted share of $3.08 in fiscal 2005 were up 18 percent from $2.60 in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the gain from the redemption of our SVE interest and the reduction in interest expense. Earnings after tax increased to $1,240 million, up 18 percent from $1,055 million in fiscal 2004. Our cash flow in 2005 was strong, enabling us to increase our dividend payments, continue to make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity, and reduce our total debt (notes payable and long-term debt, including current portion) by $2.0 billion. Our net sales for fiscal 2005 were $11.2 billion, an increase of 2 percent for the year compared to sales in fiscal 2004. Excluding the effect of the 53rd week in 2004, net sales increased 3 percent (see page 26 for our discussion of this measure not defined by GAAP). Net sales growth was primarily driven by 2 percentage points of unit volume growth on a 52 vs. 52-week basis, primarily in U.S. Retail and International. Pricing and product mix across many of our businesses contributed 3 percentage points of growth, however increases in promotional spending, primarily in U.S. Retail, offset that effect. Foreign currency exchange effects contributed 1 percentage point of growth. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table. 14 Table of Contents Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2005 vs. 2004 Unit Volume Growth: 52 vs. 52-week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) +2 pts Absence of 53rd week 1 pt Price/Product Mix/Foreign Currency Exchange +4 pts Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense 3 pts Net Sales Growth +2% Cost of sales increased by $250 million to $6,834 million, primarily driven by unit volume increases and $170 million in commodity cost increases. SG&A costs decreased by $25 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, primarily driven by four factors: a $54 million decrease in consumer marketing expense; a $37 million increase in distribution costs; a $34 million decrease in merger-related costs for the planning and execution of the integration of Pillsbury; and a $32 million increase in unallocated corporate items. As detailed above in Fiscal 2006 Consolidated Results of Operations, restructuring and other exit costs were $84 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $26 million in 2004. On March 23, 2005, we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding 6 percent notes due in 2012. The tender offer resulted in the purchase of $500 million principal amount of the notes. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, we purchased an additional $260 million principal amount of the notes in the open market. The aggregate purchases resulted in debt repurchase costs of $137 million, consisting of $73 million of non-cash interest rate swap losses reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, $59 million of purchase premium and $5 million of noncash unamortized cost of issuance expense. On February 28, 2005, SVE was terminated and our 40.5 percent interest was redeemed. On April 4, 2005, we sold our Lloyd barbecue business to Hormel Foods Corporation. We received $799 million in cash proceeds from these dispositions and recorded $499 million in gains in fiscal 2005. Net interest expense decreased 10 percent from $508 million in fiscal 2004 to $455 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to a reduction of our debt levels. In fiscal 2005 our effective income tax rate increased to 36.6 percent, driven primarily by the tax impacts of our fiscal 2005 divestitures. The higher book tax expense related to the fiscal 2005 divestitures did not result in the payment of significant cash taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 35.0 percent in fiscal 2004. After-tax earnings from joint venture operations grew 20 percent to reach $89 million in fiscal 2005, compared with $74 million reported a year earlier. This increase was primarily due to unit volume gains by our continuing joint ventures. Average diluted shares outstanding were 409 million in fiscal 2005, down 1 percent from 413 million in fiscal 2004 as the repurchase of 17 million shares from Diageo was partially offset by stock option exercises. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each reportable segment for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004: Net Sales 2006 2005 2004 In Millions, Fiscal Year Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Percent of Net Sales U.S. Retail $ 8,024 69 % $ 7,779 69 % $ 7,763 70 % International 1,837 16 1,725 15 1,550 14 Bakeries and Foodservice 1,779 15 1,740 16 1,757 16 Total $ 11,640 100 % $ 11,244 100 % $ 11,070 100 % Segment Operating Profit 2006 2005 2004 In Millions, Fiscal Year Segment Operating Profit Percent of Segment Operating Profit Segment Operating Profit Percent of Segment Operating Profit Segment Operating Profit Percent of Segment Operating Profit U.S. Retail $ 1,779 84 % $ 1,719 85 % $ 1,809 88 % International 201 9 171 8 119 6 Bakeries and Foodservice 139 7 134 7 132 6 Total $ 2,119 100 % $ 2,024 100 % $ 2,060 100 % We review operating results to evaluate segment performance. Operating profit for the reportable segments excludes: unallocated corporate items of $123 million for fiscal 2006, $32 million for fiscal 2005, and $17 million for fiscal 2004 (including a foreign currency transaction gain of $2 million in fiscal 2006 and foreign currency transaction losses of $6 million and $2 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively); net interest; restructuring and other exit costs; gains on divestitures; debt repurchase costs; income taxes; and after-tax earnings from joint ventures as these items are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets, capital expenditures for long-lived assets, and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment. See Note Sixteen to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 51 and 52 in Item Eight of this report for a reconciliation of segment operating profits and net earnings. 15 Table of Contents U.S. Retail Segment Results For fiscal 2006, net sales for our U.S. Retail operations were $8.0 billion, up 3 percent from fiscal 2005. Net sales totaled $7.8 billion in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. The components of the changes in net sales are shown in the following table: Components of U.S Retail Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Fiscal 2005 vs. 2004 Unit Volume Growth: 52 vs. 52-week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) +2 pts +3 pts Absence of 53rd week N/A 2 pts Price/Product Mix Flat +2 pts Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense +1 pt 3 pts Change in Net Sales +3% Flat Unit volume increased 2 points in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005, led by strong growth in our Yoplait business and volume increases in our Meals, Baking Products and Snacks operating units. Favorable trade and coupon spending also contributed 1 point to the fiscal 2006 increase in net sales, as the rate of promotional activity decreased on a year over year basis, largely the result of narrowing price gaps between our products and competitors products in several heavily promoted categories. Unit volume grew 1 percent in fiscal 2005 versus fiscal 2004, or 3 percent on a comparable 52 week basis, with growth in all divisions except Big G cereals. All of our U.S. Retail divisions with the exception of Big G cereals and Pillsbury USA experienced net sales growth in fiscal 2006 as shown in the table below: U.S. Retail Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Fiscal 2005 vs. 2004 Yoplait +14 % +8 % Meals +7 Flat Baking Products +6 +4 Snacks +5 Flat Big G Cereals 1 6 Pillsbury USA 1 +2 Total U.S. Retail +3 % Flat For fiscal 2006, net sales for the Yoplait division grew 14 percent over fiscal 2005 primarily due to growth in established cup yogurt lines. The Meals division net sales grew by 7 percent during fiscal 2006 led by Progresso soup and Hamburger Helper . Baking Products net sales grew 6 percent over fiscal 2005 reflecting the introduction of Warm Delights microwaveable desserts and strong performance during the holiday baking season. Net sales for the Snacks division grew 5 percent led by our Nature Valley granola bars and Chex Mix product lines. Big G cereals net sales declined 1 percent as our merchandising activity lagged competitors levels, particularly in the first half of the year. Pillsbury USA net sales also declined 1 percent due to weakness in frozen breakfast items, frozen baked goods, and refrigerated cookies. For fiscal 2005, Yoplait division net sales increased 8 percent with continued growth from established cup yogurt lines. Meals division net sales were flat with growth in our Progresso , Hamburger Helper and Old El Paso businesses offset by declines in shelf-stable vegetables. Baking Products division net sales increased 4 percent behind growth in mass merchandising channels. Snacks division net sales were flat. Big G cereals net sales fell 6 percent with contributions from new products including reduced-sugar versions of Cinnamon Toast Crunch , Trix and Cocoa Puffs , more than offset by the loss of volume associated with merchandising activity. Net sales growth of 2 percent for Pillsbury USA reflected gains for refrigerated cookies and bread and Totino pizza and hot snacks. Consumer retail purchases of our products were up 4 percent for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 in ACNielsen measured outlets and Wal-Mart. In fiscal 2005, retail dollar sales for our major brands grew 3 percent overall. The table below provides our retail dollar sales growth for major products for the past two years: Retail Dollar Sales Growth Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Fiscal 2005 vs. 2004 Composite Retail Sales +4 % +3 % Granola Bars/Grain Snacks +15 % +2 % Refrigerated Yogurt +14 +9 Ready-to-serve Soup +12 +12 Hot Snacks +8 +14 Dessert Mixes +7 +6 Refrigerated Dough +3 +4 Frozen Vegetables +2 +5 Ready-to-eat Cereals Flat 1 Microwave Popcorn 1 +4 Dry Dinners 1 +2 Fruit Snacks 6 3 Channels include ACNielsen measured outlets and Wal-Mart. Operating profit of $1.78 billion in fiscal 2006 improved $60 million, or 3 percent, over fiscal 2005. Unit volume increases accounted for approximately $83 million of the improvement. Net pricing realization (defined as the impact of list and promoted price increases net of trade and other promotion costs) and product mix of $90 million exceeded manufacturing and distribution rate increases of $62 million. Increases in consumer marketing spending of $28 million accounted for a majority of the remainder of the change. Fiscal 2005 operating profit was $1.72 billion, down $90 million, or 5 percent, versus fiscal 2004. Unit volume growth contributed approximately $13 million. Cost of sales increased by $161 million, driven primarily by commodity 16 Table of Contents cost increases, and net pricing realization did not contribute to offset those increased costs. SG&A costs decreased by $54 million, primarily due to decreases in consumer marketing spending. International Segment Results For fiscal 2006, net sales for our International segment were $1.84 billion, up 6 percent. Net sales totaled $1.72 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to $1.55 billion in 2004. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of International Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Fiscal 2005 vs. 2004 Unit Volume Growth: 52 vs. 52-week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) +4 pts +6 pts Absence of 53rd week N/A 1 pt Price/Product Mix +2 pts +3 pts Foreign Currency Exchange +1 pt +6 pts Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense 1 pt 3 pts Change in Net Sales +6% +11% For fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005, unit volume grew 4 percent, driven by a 6 percent increase in the Asia/Pacific region. For fiscal 2005 versus fiscal 2004, unit volume grew 5 percent for the year and comparable 52-week volume was up 6 percent, driven by 12 percent growth in the Asia/Pacific region. Net sales growth for our International segment by geographic region is shown in the following table: International Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Fiscal 2005 vs. 2004 Canada +10 % +9 % Asia/Pacific +9 +14 Latin America/Other +9 +10 Europe +1 +12 Total International +6 % +11 % Operating profits for fiscal 2006 grew to $201 million, up 18 percent from the prior year, with foreign currency exchange effects contributing 2 percentage points of that growth. Improvement in unit volume contributed $24 million; net pricing realization of $46 million more than offset the effects of supply chain cost changes; and consumer marketing spending increased $24 million. Operating profits grew to $171 million in fiscal 2005, 44 percent above fiscal 2004 $119 million. Foreign currency exchange effects contributed 9 percentage points of that growth. The unit volume increase in fiscal 2005 contributed approximately $27 million; net price realization more than offset increases in cost of sales; and SG&A costs increased $29 million. Bakeries and Foodservice Segment Results For fiscal 2006, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 2 percent to $1.78 billion. Net sales decreased slightly to $1.74 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to $1.76 billion in fiscal 2004. The components of the change in net sales are shown in the following table: Components of Bakeries and Foodservice Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Fiscal 2005 vs. 2004 Unit Volume Growth: 52 vs. 52-week Basis (as if fiscal 2004 contained 52 weeks) Flat 3 pts Absence of 53rd week N/A 2 pts Price/Product Mix +3 pts +4 pts Trade and Coupon Promotion Expense 1 pt Flat Change in Net Sales +2% 1% Fiscal 2006 unit volume was flat as compared to fiscal 2005, with net price realization and product mix making up the primary increase in net sales growth for the fiscal year. In fiscal 2005, unit volume was down 5 percent compared with fiscal 2004, or down 3 percent on a comparable 52-week basis, reflecting softness in shipments to our foodservice distributors and bakery customers that was partially offset by growth in sales to convenience stores. The change in net sales by major customer category is set forth in the following table: Bakeries and Foodservice Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Fiscal 2005 vs. 2004 Convenience Stores/Vending +5 % +21 % Wholesale/In-store Bakery +5 3 Distributors/Restaurants Flat 3 Total Bakeries and Foodservice +2 % 1 % Operating profits for the segment were $139 million in fiscal 2006, up 4 percent from $134 million in fiscal 2005. Unit volume was flat, and pricing actions essentially covered manufacturing and distribution rate increases of $39 million. Fiscal 2005 operating profits were up slightly at $134 million versus $132 million in fiscal 2004. The unit volume decline reduced earnings by $22 million, but $70 million of net pricing realization more than offset manufacturing and distribution rate increases. Unallocated Corporate Items For fiscal 2006, unallocated corporate expenses were $123 million compared to $32 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 included: higher domestic employee benefit expense, including incentives, that increased by $61 million over 17 Table of Contents fiscal 2005; increases in environmental reserves of $23 million; and a $10 million write-down of the asset value of a low-income housing investment. Unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal 2005 included $18 million in costs (classified as cost of sales) associated with restructuring and other exit activities. Fiscal 2004 expense was $17 million, including merger-related costs of $34 million. Joint Ventures Net sales growth for CPW in fiscal 2006 was restrained by unfavorable foreign currency effects. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings decreased from $89 million in fiscal 2005 to $64 million in fiscal 2006. As noted above, this reflects the absence of SVE earnings and the inclusion of $8 million of restructuring costs for CPW in fiscal 2006. Joint Venture Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2006 vs. 2005 Fiscal 2005 vs. 2004 CPW +4 % +13 % H agen-Dazs 7 +6 8 th Continent +14 +37 Ongoing Joint Ventures +2 % +12 % Our interest in SVE was redeemed in February 2005, and therefore is excluded from the table above. See page 26 for our discussion of this measure not defined by GAAP. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $74 million in fiscal 2004 to $89 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to unit volume gains in our continuing ventures. IMPACT OF INFLATION It is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent fiscal years other than as noted above related to commodities and employee benefit costs. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed on pages 7 through 10 in Item Seven A of this report. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources and uses of cash in the past three fiscal years are shown in the following table. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $4.9 billion in cash. In fiscal 2006, cash flow from operations totaled nearly $1.8 billion. The increase in cash flows from operations from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of increases in accrued compensation and accrued income taxes. The increase in cash flows from operations from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of increases in accrued income taxes resulting from cash benefits from the utilization of capital losses for tax purposes. Cash Sources (Uses) In Millions, for Fiscal Year Ended May 28, 2006 May 29, 2005 May 30, 2004 Net cash provided by operations $ 1,771 $ 1,711 $ 1,461 Purchases of land, buildings and equipment (360 ) (434 ) (653 ) Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings and equipment 11 24 36 Investments in businesses and affiliates, net 52 84 (22 ) Change in marketable securities 1 32 122 Proceeds from disposition of businesses 799 Other investing activities, net 4 (9 ) 2 Payment of outstanding debt, net (189 ) (2,170 ) (695 ) Proceeds from minority interest investors 835 Common stock issued 157 195 192 Treasury stock purchases (885 ) (771 ) (24 ) Dividends paid (485 ) (461 ) (413 ) Other financing activities, net (3 ) (13 ) (3 ) Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 74 $ (178 ) $ 48 In fiscal 2006, capital investment for land, buildings and equipment decreased to $360 million from $434 million in fiscal 2005. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $425 million in fiscal 2007. Dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $485 million, or $1.34 per share, an 8 percent increase from fiscal 2005 dividends of $1.24 per share. Our Board of Directors announced a quarterly dividend increase from $0.31 per share to $0.33 per share effective with the dividend paid on August 1, 2005, a quarterly dividend increase to $0.34 per share effective with the dividend paid on February 1, 2006, and another quarterly dividend increase to $0.35 per share effective with the dividend payable on August 1, 2006. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase from time to time of shares of our common stock subject to a maximum of 170 million shares held in our treasury. 18 Table of Contents During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 19 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $892 million, of which $7 million settled after the end of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2005, we repurchased 17 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $771 million. A total of 146 million shares were held in treasury at May 28, 2006. We also used cash from operations to repay $189 million in outstanding debt in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, we repaid nearly $2.2 billion of debt, including the purchase of $760 million principal amount of our 6 percent notes due in 2012. Fiscal 2005 debt repurchase costs were $137 million, consisting of $73 million of noncash interest rate swap losses reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, $59 million of purchase premium and $5 million of noncash unamortized cost of issuance expense. Capital Structure In Millions May 28, 2006 May 29, 2005 Notes payable $ 1,503 $ 299 Current portion of long-term debt 2,131 1,638 Long-term debt 2,415 4,255 Total debt 6,049 6,192 Minority interests 1,136 1,133 Stockholders equity 5,772 5,676 Total Capital $ 12,957 $ 13,001 We have $2.1 billion of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months and classified as current, including $131 million that may mature in fiscal 2007 based on the put rights of those note holders. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. On October 28, 2005, we repurchased a significant portion of our zero coupon convertible debentures pursuant to put rights of the holders for an aggregate purchase price of $1.33 billion, including $77 million of accreted original issue discount. These debentures had an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $1.86 billion. We incurred no gain or loss from this repurchase. As of May 28, 2006, there were $371 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the debentures outstanding, or $268 million of accreted value. We used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to fund the purchase price of the debentures. We also have reclassified the remaining zero coupon convertible debentures to long-term debt based on the October 2008 put rights of the holders. On March 23, 2005, we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding 6 percent notes due in 2012. The tender offer resulted in the purchase of $500 million principal amount of the notes. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, we purchased an additional $260 million principal amount of the notes in the open market. The aggregate purchases resulted in the debt repurchase costs as discussed above. Our minority interests consist of interests in certain of our subsidiaries that are held by third parties. General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC), our subsidiary, holds the manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated with the production and retail sale of Big G ready-to-eat cereals, Progresso soups and Old El Paso products. In May 2002, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sold 150,000 Class A preferred membership interests in GMC to an unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $150 million, and in October 2004, another of our wholly owned subsidiaries sold 835,000 Series B-1 preferred membership interests in GMC in exchange for $835 million. All interests in GMC, other than the 150,000 Class A interests and 835,000 Series B-1 interests, but including all managing member interests, are held by our wholly owned subsidiaries. In fiscal 2003, General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital), a subsidiary formed for the purpose of purchasing and collecting our receivables, sold $150 million of its Series A preferred stock to an unrelated third-party investor. The Class A interests of GMC receive quarterly preferred distributions at a floating rate equal to (i) the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 90 basis points, divided by (ii) 0.965. This rate will be adjusted by agreement between the third-party investor holding the Class A interests and GMC every five years, beginning in June 2007. Under certain circumstances, GMC also may be required to be dissolved and liquidated, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, failure to deliver the preferred distributions, failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody or BBB by Standard & Poor s, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A interests as a result of a breach of GMC obligations to assist in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC would receive the amount of its then current capital account balance. The managing member may avoid liquidation in most circumstances by exercising an option to purchase the Class A interests. The Series B-1 interests of GMC are entitled to receive quarterly preferred distributions at a fixed rate of 4.5 percent per year, which is scheduled to be reset to a new fixed rate through a remarketing in October 2007. Beginning in October 2007, the managing member of GMC may elect to repurchase the Series B-1 interests for an amount equal to the holder then current capital account balance plus any applicable make-whole amount. GMC is not required to purchase the Series B-1 interests nor may these investors put these interests to us. The Series B-1 interests will be exchanged for shares of our perpetual preferred stock upon the occurrence of any of the following events: our senior unsecured debt rating falling below either Ba3 as rated by Moody or BB- as rated by Standard & Poor or Fitch, Inc., 19 Table of Contents our bankruptcy or liquidation, a default on any of our senior indebtedness resulting in an acceleration of indebtedness having an outstanding principal balance in excess of $50 million, failing to pay a dividend on our common stock in any fiscal quarter, or certain liquidating events. If GMC fails to make a required distribution to the holders of Series B-1 interests when due, we will be restricted from paying any dividend (other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock) or other distributions on shares of our common or preferred stock, and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common or preferred stock, until all such accrued and undistributed distributions are paid to the holders of the Series B-1 interests. For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of GMC and GM Capital are included in our consolidated financial statements. The third-party investors Class A and Series B-1 interests in GMC and the preferred stock of GM Capital are reflected as minority interests on our consolidated balance sheets, and the return to the third party investors is reflected in interest expense, net, in the consolidated statements of earnings. See Note Eight to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 43 and 44 in Item Eight for more information regarding our minority interests. At May 28, 2006, our cash and cash equivalents included $11 million in GMC and $21 million in GM Capital that are restricted from use for our general corporate purposes pursuant to the terms of our agreements with third-party minority interest investors. In October 2004, we entered into a forward purchase contract under which we are obligated to deliver between approximately 14 million and 17 million shares of our common stock in October 2007, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, in exchange for $750 million of cash or, in certain circumstances, securities of an affiliate of the forward counterparty. The following table, when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table above, shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments: Debt Structure In Millions May 28, 2006 May 29, 2005 Floating-rate $ 2,228 37 % $ 1,049 17 % Fixed-rate 3,821 63 % 5,143 83 % Total Debt $ 6,049 100 % $ 6,192 100 % Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We can issue commercial paper in the United States, Canada and Europe. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $2.95 billion of fee-paid committed credit lines and $335 million in uncommitted lines. On October 21, 2005, we entered into a new $1.1 billion 364-day credit facility expiring in October 2006 and a new $1.1 billion five-year credit facility expiring in October 2010. These new facilities replaced our $1.1 billion credit facility that would have expired in January 2006 and our $750 million credit facility that would have expired in April 2006. We also have a $750 million five-year credit facility that will expire in January 2009. Our credit facilities, certain of our long-term debt agreements and our minority interests contain restrictive covenants. At May 28, 2006, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. The following table details the fee-paid committed credit lines we had available as of May 28, 2006: Committed Credit Facilities Amount Credit facility maturing: October 2006 $ 1.10 billion January 2009 0.75 billion October 2010 1.10 billion Total Committed Credit Facilities $ 2.95 billion We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC covering the sale of debt securities, common stock, preference stock, depository shares, securities warrants, purchase contracts, purchase units and units. As of May 28, 2006, approximately $5.1 billion remained available under the shelf registration for future use. We believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities) to debt (defined as notes payable plus long-term debt, including current portion). Our fixed charge coverage in fiscal 2006 was 4.6 compared to 4.7 in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 was favorably impacted by the gain on our disposition of our 40.5 percent equity interest in SVE. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased to 29 percent in fiscal 2006 from 28 percent in fiscal 2005. Currently, Standard and Poor Corporation has ratings of BBB+ on our publicly held long-term debt and A-2 on our commercial paper. Moody Investors Services, Inc. has ratings of Baa2 for our long-term debt and P-2 for our commercial paper. Fitch Ratings, Inc. rates our long-term debt BBB+ and our commercial paper F-2. Dominion Bond Rating Service in Canada currently rates General Mills as A-low. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We also believe that growth in return on average capital is a key measure, and it is used for management performance ratings. Return on average capital increased from 10.0 percent in 2005 to 10.6 percent in 2006 due to earnings growth and disciplined use of cash. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS It is not our general business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue 20 Table of Contents guarantees to third parties. We have, however, issued guarantees and comfort letters of $171 million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates, primarily for CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases, which totaled $408 million at May 28, 2006. At May 28, 2006, we had invested in four variable interest entities (VIEs). We are the primary beneficiary (PB) of General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital), a subsidiary that we consolidate as set forth in Note Eight to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 43 and 44 in Item Eight of this report. We also have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in Geneva, Illinois. Even though we are the PB, we have not consolidated this entity because it is not material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity at May 28, 2006. This entity had property and equipment of $50 million and long-term debt of $50 million at May 28, 2006. We are not the PB of the remaining two VIEs. Our maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is limited to the $150 million minority interest in GM Capital, the contract manufacturer debt and our $6 million of equity investments in the two remaining VIEs. The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period. The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer-directed marketing commitments that support our brands. The net fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps was $159 million at May 28, 2006, based on market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations primarily consist of income taxes, accrued compensation and benefits, and miscellaneous liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items. We do not have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our defined-benefit retirement and other postretirement benefit plans. Further information on these plans, including our expected contributions for fiscal 2007, is set forth in Note Thirteen to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 47 through 50 in Item Eight of this report. In Millions, Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2007 2008-09 2010-11 2012 and Thereafter Long-term debt $ 4,546 $ 2,131 $ 971 $ 55 $ 1,389 Accrued interest 152 152 Operating leases 408 92 142 89 85 Purchase obligations 2,351 2,068 144 75 64 Total $ 7,457 $ 4,443 $ 1,257 $ 219 $ 1,538 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note One to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 35 through 37 in Item Eight of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies include our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities; goodwill and other intangible asset impairments; income taxes; and pension and other postretirement benefits. Trade and Consumer Promotion Activities We report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs. The consumer coupon costs recorded as a reduction of sales are based on the estimated redemption value of those coupons, as determined by historical patterns of coupon redemption and consideration of current market conditions such as competitive activity in those product categories. The trade promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays, discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices, and payments to gain distribution of new products. The cost of these activities is recognized as the related revenue is recorded, which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made based on the quantity of customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade and consumer promotion liability was $339 million as of May 28, 2006, and $283 million as of May 29, 2005. Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter. In comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter, the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days worth of incremental shipments (based on a five-day week), reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets. If, due to quarter-end promotions or other reasons, our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected. 21 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairments Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying amount of goodwill for a reporting unit with its fair value and if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment has occurred. Finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and other factors. We have completed our annual impairment testing and determined none of our goodwill or other intangible assets was impaired. Income Taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues. We accrue liabilities in current income taxes payable for potential assessments related to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items, except for the accounting for losses recorded as part of the Pillsbury transaction. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters, including the accounting for losses recorded as part of the Pillsbury transaction, will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We have defined-benefit retirement plans covering most U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom employees. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. The hourly plans include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. Our principal retirement plan covering domestic salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest in plan participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our U.S. and Canadian retirees. The salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis and made $95 million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2006. Actuarial Assumptions We recognize benefits provided during retirement over the plan participants active working life. Accordingly, we must use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, how we derive the market-related values of assets and the health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. The investment objective for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. The goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The pension and postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the pension and other postretirement plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to U.S. equities; 20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) were 16 percent, 9 percent, 11 percent, 12 percent and 12 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 year periods ended May 28, 2006. For fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we assumed a rate of return of 9.6 percent on our pension plan assets and our other postretirement plan assets. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2007 by approximately $18 million. 22 Table of Contents Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our pension and other postretirement obligations. Those same discount rates also are used to determine pension and other postretirement income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using high-quality corporate bond yields, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. The discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were 5.55 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, for the obligations as of May 29, 2005, and for our fiscal 2006 income and expense, and 6.65 percent for the obligations as of May 30, 2004, and for our fiscal 2005 income and expense. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2007 by approximately $24 million. Market-Related Value We base our determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care trend rates annually. Our review is based on data and information we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short term expectations. Our current health care cost trend rate assumption is 11 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 10 percent for retirees under age 65. These rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in 2013 for retirees over age 65 and 2014 for retirees under age 65. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. If the health care cost trend rate increased by 1 percentage point in each future year, the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of postretirement expense for fiscal 2007 would increase by $7 million, and the postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 28, 2006, would increase by $90 million. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2006, we recorded net pension and postretirement expense of $25 million compared to $6 million in fiscal 2005 and $5 million in fiscal 2004. As of May 28, 2006, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $464 million on our pension plans and $317 million on our postretirement plans, primarily as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. For our fiscal 2007 pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate, we have increased the discount rate to 6.55 percent for our pension liabilities and 6.5 percent for our other postretirement liabilities, based on interest rates and our credit spread as of May 28, 2006. The expected rate of return on plan assets remains 9.6 percent. Actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(Revised) Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which generally requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value and to recognize this cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The standard is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with several transition options regarding prospective versus retrospective application. We will adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior year results will not be restated, but fiscal 2007 results will be presented as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation from the beginning of fiscal 1997. We currently expect the impact of adopting the fair value method of valuing stock awards to be approximately $0.11 to $0.12 per diluted share for fiscal 2007. However, the actual impact on fiscal 2007 will be largely dependent 23 Table of Contents on the particular structure of stock-based awards granted during fiscal 2007 and various market factors that affect the fair value of awards. We are evaluating whether to allocate these costs to our operating segments. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required, thereby reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods following adoption. While those amounts cannot be estimated for future periods, the amount of operating cash flows generated in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was $41 million for fiscal 2006, $62 million for fiscal 2005 and $63 million for fiscal 2004. See Note One to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 35 through 37 in Item Eight of this report. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS No. 151 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We do not expect SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in financial statements, requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters and indicates how any tax reserves should be classified in a balance sheet. FIN 48 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We are evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on our results of operations and financial condition. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. Fiscal years prior to 2004 are presented in support of our discussion of these measures outside of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Diluted EPS excluding the effects of our convertible debentures and the net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs: This non-GAAP measure is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the Board of Directors rating of our performance for management and employee incentive compensation. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors as it eliminates the effects of infrequently occurring events, thereby improving the comparability of year-to-year results of operations.

Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. Operating profit for the reportable segments and total segment operating profit exclude unallocated corporate items; net interest; restructuring and other exit costs; gains on divestitures; debt repurchase costs; income taxes; and after-tax earnings from joint ventures as these items are centrally managed at the corporate level.
