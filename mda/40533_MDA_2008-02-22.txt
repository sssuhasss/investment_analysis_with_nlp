ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (For an overview of the company business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW General Dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; shipbuilding design and construction; and information systems, technologies and services. The company operates through four business groups Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. General Dynamics primary customers are the U.S. military, other U.S. government organizations, the armed forces of other nations, and a diverse base of corporate, government and individual buyers of business aircraft. The company operates in two primary markets: defense and business aviation. The majority of the company revenues derive from contracts with the U.S. military. 2007 Sales by Customer Base The nation engagement in the global war on terror, coupled with the need to modernize U.S. military forces, has driven steady Department of Defense funding increases since 2001. In particular, procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of the company revenues. These budget lines continue to enjoy sustained increases, demonstrating administration and congressional support. Defense Department funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6.8 percent from fiscal 2001 through 2008, while procurement and R&D spending has grown nearly 8 percent annually during that period. For fiscal year 2008, the Congress appropriated $480 billion for the Department of Defense, including approximately $175 billion for procurement and R&D. Budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding, and the company expects that this 2008 funding will be applied toward programs over the next few years. For fiscal year 2009, the President has requested that the Congress appropriate $515 billion for the Department of Defense, a 7.5 percent increase over the 2008 funding. This includes $184 billion for procurement and R&D, an increase of 5 percent over 2008, representing more than one-third of the total 2009 budget request. During this period of war, defense budgets have included the President budget submission, as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter. For fiscal year 2008, the administration requested approximately $189 billion in supplemental funding, including approximately $75 billion, or 40 percent, for additional investment spending. The Congress has appropriated $87 billion of that request and will consider the remaining $102 billion in 2008. If this second supplemental is approved, defense funding for fiscal year 2008 will total approximately $670 billion, a 116 percent increase since 2001. While these supplemental funding requests have increased total defense spending levels, some military service accounts are under pressure as the services move funds among accounts to cover current war needs. In addition, supplemental appropriations do not include the level of program detail typically provided in general defense appropriations. These two factors have made it increasingly difficult to forecast the timing and amount of the impact of supplemental funding on the company programs. Looking ahead, the company expects the defense budget top line to remain well funded for the near term, led by the need to continue to support the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the landscape will continue to evolve during this dynamic period, the company expects near-term defense funding to be driven primarily by the following: continued support for the warfighter from the administration and the Congress in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment; the number of troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with the increase in the overall size of the U.S. military; the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed during the war; and the need to modernize the country military infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare. Based on the recently approved and proposed defense budgets, the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs will likely continue to grow in 2008 and 2009. Defense Funding 2001 2009 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 19 Table of Contents Beyond the company U.S. defense market, governments around the world are increasingly funding weapons and equipment modernization programs, leading to expanding defense export opportunities. The company is committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by foreign demand for military hardware and information technologies. While the revenue upside can be significant, European and other foreign defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures. As General Dynamics broadens the customer base for its defense products around the world, the company expects growing international sales. The business-aviation market also continues to expand, and 2007 was another strong year. Despite the recent uncertainty in the U.S. macroeconomic environment, the Aerospace group North American and international order activity remains robust. Following seven consecutive quarters with a book-to-bill ratio exceeding one, the Aerospace record backlog extends through 2011 for large-cabin models. At this juncture, management has not observed any indications of backlog weakness such as cancellations, financing issues or requests to delay delivery. The company expects continued growth in the business-jet market, stemming from its strong products in the long-range and ultra-long-range markets, and robust sales of the company mid-size products. In particular, the market for the company business jets outside the United States has demonstrated powerful growth. In 2007, for the first time in the company history, Gulfstream received more than 50 percent of its aircraft orders from outside North America. Of note, the European and Asian markets comprised more than one-third of the group orders in 2007, and demand remains strong. General Dynamics management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices, disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements. The company solid performance over the past 10 years is measured in its sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow. General Dynamics record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has provided the company management the flexibility to execute its operational strategy, and enabled it to consistently deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchases. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW The following discussion of the company results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level. The disclosures focus on the material financial measures the company management uses to evaluate the performance of each of its four business groups, including sales, operating earnings and margins, and backlog. For the defense business groups, the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group results rather than types of products and services, which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers. For the Aerospace group, the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. In the defense business groups, the majority of the sales are generated by long-term government contracts. As discussed further in the critical accounting policies section, the company accounts for sales under these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. As a result, changes in sales are generally discussed in terms of volume. Volume indicates increases or decreases in sales due to changes in production or construction activity levels, changes in delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts. In the Aerospace group, sales contracts for new aircraft typically have two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft completion, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics. The company records revenues at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. Changes in sales in this group result from the amount of new aircraft deliveries (both green and completion), the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre-owned aircraft sold. Operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are generally discussed in terms of changes in sales volume, performance, or the mix of contracts and the phases of work within those contracts (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable, development/production). Performance 20 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract and/or the estimated costs required to complete the contract. The following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract. Operating earnings and margins in the Aerospace group are generally a function of the prices the company is able to charge for its various aircraft models, the operational efficiency of the group in the manufacture and completion of the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-size aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group earnings and margins include the number and type of pre-owned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group, which include selling expenses and research and development costs. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 27,240 $ 24,063 $ 3,177 13.2 % Operating earnings 3,113 2,625 488 18.6 % Operating margin 11.4 % 10.9 % General Dynamics generated strong results in 2007 compared with 2006, ending the year with the highest sales, operating earnings, net earnings, cash flow from operations, orders and backlog in the company history. The company produced solid sales growth in 2007 on the strength of rising sales in each of the company business groups. In particular, the Combat Systems and Aerospace groups generated the most substantial sales growth in 2007 due to strong worldwide demand for military vehicles and business-jet aircraft. Sales in the Information Systems and Technology group increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Anteon International Corporation in 2006, as organic growth in the group North American market was largely offset by a scheduled reduction in sales in the United Kingdom. Sales were up slightly in the Marine Systems group compared with 2006. The company operating earnings grew at a higher rate than sales in 2007, the result of significant operating leverage achieved in three of the company four business groups. The Aerospace group margins improved 120 basis points on the strength of improved pricing and ongoing productivity improvements. Margins in the Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups were up 40 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively, due to improving operational execution. Overall, the company operating margins increased 50 basis points for the second year in a row to 11.4 percent in 2007. The company continued focus on operations has generated four consecutive years of operating margin expansion and a total 260 basis-point improvement in margins over the past five years. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 24,063 $ 20,975 $ 3,088 14.7 % Operating earnings 2,625 2,179 446 20.5 % Operating margin 10.9 % 10.4 % The company sales and operating earnings increased significantly in 2006. Increased new aircraft deliveries in the Aerospace group, strong demand for combat vehicles and armament and munitions products in the Combat Systems group, and acquisitions in the Information Systems and Technology group were the most significant drivers of the increase in sales. Each of the company four business groups generated double-digit earnings growth in 2006. In particular, the Marine Systems group operating earnings grew over 50 percent due to significantly improved performance on its ship construction programs. The Aerospace group earnings also increased substantially on strong new aircraft volume and improved pricing on units delivered in 2006 compared with 2005 deliveries. The improved performance resulted in an overall increase in the company operating margins from 10.4 percent in 2005 to 10.9 percent in 2006. Cash Flow The company produced significant cash flows from operations in 2007, generating cash from operations in excess of net earnings for the ninth consecutive year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.1 billion in each of 2006 and 2005. In addition, the company generated over $300 in cash in both 2006 and 2005 from the sale of several non-core businesses. Over the three-year period, the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase its common stock, pay dividends and reduce its outstanding debt. The company net debt debt less cash and equivalents and short-term investments was a net surplus of $268 at the end of 2007 compared with net debt of $1.2 billion at the end of 2006. The company achieved this reduction after giving effect to $330 spent on acquisitions, over $500 of share repurchases, $430 of company-sponsored research and development, almost $475 of capital expenditures and $445 of dividends paid during the year. Other Financial Information General and administrative (G&A) expenses as a percentage of sales were 6.0 percent in 2007, and 6.2 percent in each of 2006 and 2005. G&A was $1.6 billion in 2007, $1.5 billion in 2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005. The company expects 2008 G&A as a percent of sales to approximate the 2007 rate. Net interest expense was $70 in 2007 compared with $101 in 2006 and $118 in 2005. Interest income generated by the company strong cash position has increased during each of the past three years while scheduled repayments of the company long-term debt have steadily reduced interest expense. The company expects net interest expense of approximately $10 to $15 in 2008 based on the company substantial balance of invested cash. General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 21 Table of Contents The company effective tax rate was 31.7 percent in 2007, 32.3 percent in 2006 and 30.0 percent in 2005. The company effective tax rate in 2007 was impacted favorably by the resolution of the company 2003 to 2004 federal income tax audit with the Internal Revenue Service. This settlement resulted in a benefit of $18, or approximately $0.04 per share, which reduced the company effective tax rate by 60 basis points. In 2005, the company favorably resolved its 1999 to 2002 federal income tax audit. This settlement resulted in a $66 benefit, or approximately $0.16 per share, which reduced the company 2005 tax rate by 320 basis points. The company anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 32.5 percent in 2008 excluding the potential resolution of tax matters related to prior years or other discrete events that may occur in the future. For additional discussion of tax matters, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2007, General Dynamics completed the sale of its coal mining operation and received proceeds of approximately $25. The company had previously recognized an after-tax loss of $37 in discontinued operations in 2006 in anticipation of the sale. In 2006, the company completed the sale of its aggregates operation. The company received approximately $315 in cash from the sale of this business and recognized an after-tax gain of $220 in discontinued operations. In 2005, General Dynamics completed the sale of several small businesses that were not core to the company. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of income taxes, and reported an after-tax loss of $8 in 2005 from the sale of these businesses. The company reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these divested businesses, and their operating results are included as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. For additional discussion of the company divestiture activities and the results of discontinued operations, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog General Dynamics total backlog was $46.8 billion at year end, up 7 percent from $43.7 billion at the end of 2006. Funded backlog increased 9 percent in 2007 to $37.2 billion compared with $34 billion at year-end 2006. The company generated total new orders of $29.5 billion in 2007, representing significant order activity across each of the company business groups during the year. The total backlog for the company defense businesses decreased 4 percent to $34.6 billion at year-end 2007, compared with $36 billion at the end of 2006. The defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog was $25.6 billion at the end of 2007. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. The unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders that do not meet these criteria. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, the company has included in the backlog only firm contracts it believes are likely to receive funding. The Aerospace group total backlog increased $4.6 billion or 59 percent in 2007, reaching a new high of $12.3 billion at year end. The group received a record number of orders during the year, resulting in funded backlog of $11.6 billion at the end of 2007, up 67 percent over 2006. The funded backlog represents orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer. The Aerospace unfunded backlog of $665 at year-end 2007 consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The company backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft. IDIQ contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed. These agreements, which set forth the majority of the contractual terms, including prices, are funded as delivery orders are placed. A significant portion of the company IDIQ value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole-source supplier to design, develop, produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies. Management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems. However, because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders, the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. Contract options in the company defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts, if the customer exercises the option. These options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft. The company recognizes options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. 22 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, the potential value associated with these IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $14.5 billion, up from $13.1 billion at the end of 2006. The company expects to realize this value over the next 15 years. This represents management estimate of the potential value the company will receive. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower. REVIEW OF OPERATING SEGMENTS AEROSPACE Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 4,828 $ 4,116 $ 712 17.3 % Operating earnings 810 644 166 25.8 % Operating margin 16.8 % 15.6 % Aircraft deliveries (in units) : Green 138 113 Completion 138 104 The Aerospace group continued its strong performance in 2007 as sales and operating earnings increased significantly over 2006. Growing global demand for business jets has led to successive years of significant order activity and resulting substantial growth in the group backlog. To meet this demand, the group has steadily increased its aircraft production rate and delivery schedule. As a result, new aircraft sales grew 22 percent in 2007, including a 22 percent increase in green aircraft deliveries and a 33 percent increase in completions. In addition, aircraft services volume increased by 20 percent over 2006, reflecting the growing global installed base of business-jet aircraft. Pre-owned aircraft activity declined significantly in 2007 as increasing numbers of customers chose to sell their own aircraft rather than trade them. Sales of pre-owned aircraft were $78 in 2007 compared with $217 in 2006. The Aerospace group operating earnings and margins increased substantially in 2007 compared with 2006. Operating earnings were up approximately $205 as a result of the increased new-aircraft and aircraft-services volume. Improved pricing on units delivered in 2007 compared with 2006 deliveries, combined with labor efficiencies and productivity improvements particularly in the completion process, contributed another $65 of earnings growth. Increased selling costs associated with the year substantial order activity, higher product-development spending and increased G&A costs reduced the group earnings growth by about $90. Reduced sales of pre-owned aircraft lowered the earnings growth by $14. The operating leverage achieved by the group, offset in part by a mix shift to include proportionately more lower-margin mid-size aircraft deliveries, resulted in a 150 basis-point increase in new-aircraft margins over 2006. Aircraft services margins were up 50 basis points over 2006. Overall, the Aerospace group produced a 120 basis-point increase in margins for the second consecutive year. The company expects to deliver 157 new aircraft in 2008, an increase of 14 percent over 2007. Based on this projected increase in deliveries, the company expects the Aerospace group sales will grow between 13 and 15 percent in 2008. Combining the improved pricing in the 2008 scheduled deliveries with increased spending on research and development, the company expects the group operating margins to be 20 to 40 basis points higher than those achieved in 2007. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 4,116 $ 3,433 $ 683 19.9 % Operating earnings 644 495 149 30.1 % Operating margin 15.6 % 14.4 % Aircraft Deliveries (in units): Green 113 89 Completion 104 84 The Aerospace group sales growth in 2006 was due largely to higher new aircraft deliveries. New aircraft sales increased 22 percent in 2006 over 2005. Green deliveries were up 27 percent while aircraft completions were up 24 percent. The group introduced the mid-size G150 aircraft in 2006, which added 14 green deliveries and eight completions. Aircraft services sales increased 15 percent in 2006, while pre-owned aircraft sales remained steady compared to 2005. Operating earnings in 2006 increased approximately $150 as a result of higher new aircraft volume. Pricing improvements on all aircraft models overcame a shift in the mix of deliveries in the second half of the year toward proportionately more mid-size aircraft deliveries to contribute an additional $25 of operating earnings. Improved margins on pre-owned aircraft sales increased operating earnings by $7 while higher product development spending and selling costs reduced the operating earnings growth by $33. Backlog The Aerospace group backlog was $12.3 billion at the end of 2007, an increase of 59 percent over 2006. The group funded backlog grew 67 percent in 2007 to $11.6 billion at year end. The group received a record level of orders for the fourth consecutive year, and after increasing General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 23 Table of Contents nearly 30 percent each year from 2004 through 2006, new orders grew over 60 percent in 2007. The group has achieved a book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by sales) greater than one for the past seven consecutive quarters. New Aircraft Book-to-Bill Ratio 2005 2007* * Represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries (in units) during the year.

The backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft. The group order profile in 2007 reflected continued strong activity in the North American market as well as rising demand around the world, which resulted in a shift to include over 50 percent of orders in the year from customers outside North America for the first time. The group backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries through 2011. COMBAT SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 7,797 $ 5,983 $ 1,814 30.3 % Operating earnings 916 677 239 35.3 % Operating margin 11.7 % 11.3 % Among the company four business groups, Combat Systems experienced the greatest growth in sales and operating earnings in 2007 and in the fourth quarter generated the highest quarterly sales and operating earnings of any segment in the company history. This strong performance resulted from continued growth across all of the group product lines, with particularly strong growth in the company military vehicle markets worldwide. As a result, each of the group businesses experienced double-digit sales and earnings increases in 2007. Over half of the growth resulted from increased volume in the group U.S. military vehicle business, including core programs as well as adjacent market opportunities. The ongoing U.S. presence in Iraq and Afghanistan and the military need to reset and repair vehicles damaged in military operations continued to generate strong demand for the group combat vehicles and related services. Sales increased 31 percent in this business in 2007 compared with 2006, driven by the following primary contributors: the company ongoing Abrams main battle tank modernization work; activity on the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program; the ramp-up of production of light armored vehicles (LAVs) for the U.S. Marine Corps; and the production of military vehicles under the mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle program. The group supports the M1 Abrams tank by providing upgrades, including the Abrams Integrated Management (AIM), the System Enhancement Package (SEP) and the Tank Urban Survivability Kit (TUSK). Stryker continued to be the group largest program in 2007, with volume up most significantly on contractor logistics support activity. MRAP emerged as a high-priority acquisition program for the Marine Corps and Army during 2007. The group munitions business also contributed significantly to the group sales and earnings in 2007. Sales were up almost 50 percent in this business in 2007 compared with 2006. The munitions business generated approximately 15 percent organic sales growth, with particularly strong volume in its large- and medium-caliber munitions supply contracts. The remainder of the increase in sales resulted from the acquisition of SNC Technologies Inc. (SNC TEC) from SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., in January 2007. SNC TEC is an ammunition systems integrator that supplies small-, medium- and large-caliber ammunition and related products to the Canadian Forces, U.S. and other national defense customers and law enforcement agencies around the world. Sales in the group weapons systems business grew 13 percent in 2007 due primarily to increased activity on a contract to produce systems that protect U.S. combat forces from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The group European military vehicle business experienced sales growth of almost 30 percent in 2007. Increased activity on various programs to produce military vehicles for non-U.S. governments was the most significant factor in the increased sales. In particular, volume was up in 2007 on the Pandur II wheeled vehicle contracts for Portugal and the Czech Republic and the Piranha wheeled armored vehicle programs for several European governments. In December 2007, the Czech Republic cancelled the company contract for 199 vehicles. The company is in discussions with the Czech Republic about a contract for a reduced quantity. While these 24 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents discussions may result in an overall reduction in the size of the Czech Pandur contract, the company does not believe the outcome of the negotiations will have a material effect on the group operating results. The Combat Systems group operating margins improved 40 basis points in 2007 compared with the margins achieved by the group in 2006. Margins increased due to a shift in contract mix and improved performance across a number of the group wheeled military vehicle programs. The improvement in the group margins was limited somewhat by the inclusion of lower-margin acquisitions in the munitions business, increased supplier costs on the group small-caliber munitions contract and costs recognized in connection with the company exit from the group European commercial trading business. The company expects 2008 sales growth in the Combat Systems group in the 9 to 10 percent range based on the group substantial backlog, with operating margins improving 30 to 50 basis points over the 2007 margins. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 5,983 $ 5,021 $ 962 19.2 % Operating earnings 677 576 101 17.5 % Operating margin 11.3 % 11.5 % The Combat Systems group sales and operating earnings increased substantially in 2006 over 2005. Sales in the group U.S. and European military vehicle businesses were up 17 percent due to higher production activity on the Stryker program and several European military vehicle contracts. Activity also increased on the Army Future Combat Systems (FCS) development program and various domestic and international LAV contracts. The group weapons systems and munitions businesses generated a 24 percent increase in sales in 2006 compared with 2005. High demand for protection systems for U.S. forces and increased volume on a contract to provide small-caliber ammunition to the Army contributed to the growth in these businesses in 2006. The group acquisition of Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation Scranton operation in 2006 contributed approximately 1 percent of the group total 2006 sales growth. Backlog The Combat Systems group ended 2007 with a total backlog of $12.9 billion, an increase of 8 percent over 2006. Funded backlog grew 7 percent to $10.8 billion. The group backlog consists primarily of long-term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through 2014. The group backlog at December 31, 2007, included over $2.8 billion for contracts related to the M1 Abrams main battle tank. This includes both the M1A2 SEP and the M1A1 AIM programs. Under the SEP program, the company retrofits M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics, command-and-control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank effectiveness. Under the AIM program, M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks are completely overhauled and returned to a like-new condition. At year end, the backlog included approximately $1.5 billion for the SEP program and close to $400 for AIM. During 2007, the company received awards totaling over $750 for the SEP program to upgrade and reset approximately 340 vehicles and for related program support. The group also received an order from the Army in 2007 worth over $300 under the Egyptian M1A1 Abrams tank co-production program to supply 125 tank kits for assembly in Egypt. In February 2008, the group received a multiyear contract from the Army to upgrade 435 Abrams tanks to the M1A2 SEP V2 configuration. The first increment of the contract, for 20 tanks, is valued at $39. The largest single contract in the group backlog at December 31, 2007, is the Army FCS program. The backlog at year end included approximately $1.5 billion for FCS. The company leads the system development of the manned ground vehicle element of the program, as well as the development of the autonomous navigation systems for FCS ground vehicles. The company current contract extends through 2012. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $1 billion for the Army Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program. The backlog includes the production of over 400 vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2009. In 2007, the group received orders under the Stryker program totaling $1.2 billion, including awards worth approximately $335 for the production of approximately 220 vehicles. The group also received total awards of over $500 in 2007 for Stryker contractor logistics support. The group backlog under the MRAP program totaled $570 at year end. The group is producing two separate vehicles under this program the Cougar, in connection with a joint venture, and the RG-31. During 2007, the group was awarded a total of $575 for approximately 1,190 Cougar vehicles and $350 for 620 RG-31 MRAP vehicles. The year-end backlog represents approximately 720 Cougar vehicles and 450 RG-31 vehicles. In the first quarter of 2008, the company received, and added to the backlog, orders valued at approximately $150 for an additional 183 Cougar vehicles and related logistics and spares. The company expects to complete its deliveries under this program in the first half of 2008. The Combat Systems group has several significant international, long-term combat vehicle production contracts in backlog. The group Leopard 2E program is a battle tank manufacturing contract for the Spanish army using a design licensed from a German company. The group backlog at year end included approximately $550 for the production of General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 25 Table of Contents 119 Leopard tanks, with deliveries scheduled through 2010. The group also produces Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles for the Spanish army. The backlog at the end of the year included approximately $650 for the production of 190 Pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2014. The group year-end backlog also included approximately $370 for a contract with the government of Portugal for 251 Pandur II vehicles, $360 for a contract with the government of Belgium for 138 Piranha wheeled armored vehicles and $675 under the original contract with the Czech Republic for approximately 135 Pandur II vehicles. The company is in negotiations with the customer regarding the Czech contract, which may result in a reduced number of vehicles to be delivered. In addition, the group was awarded a contract valued at approximately $85 in 2007 to provide 21 Piranha IIIC 8x8 amphibious armored personnel carriers to the Spanish marines for delivery between 2009 and 2013. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end also included approximately $2.3 billion in weapons systems, munitions, detection systems and composite-structures programs. The group received an order from the Army in 2007 worth approximately $150 for the production of Hydra-70 (2.75 inch) rockets. The total contract value to date is over $500. Additionally, the Army awarded the group a contract worth over $100 for the production of reactive armor for the Bradley Fighting vehicle. MARINE SYSTEMS Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 4,993 $ 4,940 $ 53 1.1 % Operating earnings 421 375 46 12.3 % Operating margin 8.4 % 7.6 % The Marine Systems group sales were up slightly in 2007 compared with 2006. Approximately 60 percent of the group sales in 2007 and 2006 were generated by three of the group mature ship-construction programs for the U.S. Navy the Virginia-class submarine, the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyer and the T-AKE combat-logistics ship. Combined sales from these core programs in 2007 were essentially unchanged compared with 2006. In 2007, the group delivered ships two through four of the current 10-ship T-AKE program to the Navy, driving volume up significantly, while activity on the Virginia-class and the DDG-51 destroyer programs declined during the year. The Virginia-class program volume was down slightly due to workload timing. The company expects to deliver the fourth and final ship of the cost-reimbursable Virginia Block I contract in the first quarter of 2008, and construction is in process on five of the six ships under the fixed-price Block II contract. Deliveries under Block II are scheduled through 2013. Volume on the destroyer program began to decline in 2007 as the group continued construction of the remaining six ships under contract. Deliveries are scheduled through 2011, including two in 2008. Beyond these large construction programs, volume was up across the group ship design, engineering, repair and overhaul, and early-stage construction programs in process for the Navy. These include the detail design of the DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer and the construction of the first Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). Volume on these two programs increased over 60 percent in 2007 compared with 2006. The company LCS was approximately 65 percent complete at year end. Additionally, activity was up over 10 percent on the group engineering, repair and overhaul contracts for the Navy in 2007, particularly in the group nuclear submarine support and logistics services business. Volume decreased in 2007 on the group SSGN submarine conversion program and commercial ship construction programs. The group completed its fourth and final SSGN submarine conversion in 2007. Marine Systems commercial shipbuilding activity was down in 2007 due to the completion of the group four-ship commercial tanker program in 2006. Construction of the first two of nine ships under the group product-carrier contract has just begun. Overall, combined sales for the SSGN program and the commercial shipbuilding contracts decreased over 50 percent in 2007. The Marine Systems group operating earnings and margins grew significantly in 2007 on steady sales. The group has generated operating efficiencies that led to improved performance on several of its key programs. Most notably, the Virginia-class submarine, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and the SSGN submarine conversion programs experienced significant performance improvements during the year. Additionally, the company and the Navy reached an agreement in 2007 to restructure the T-AKE contract. The agreement included a resolution of the company outstanding request for equitable adjustment (REA), which resulted in revised pricing on ships one through nine and the addition of five option ships. The Navy exercised the option for the 10 th ship in January 2008. Prior to the agreement, the company was recognizing revenue on the T-AKE program at a break-even level pending the resolution of the REA. After the contract restructuring, the estimate at completion for the program was revised and the company began recognizing profit on the contract in the second quarter of 2007. As a result of the improved performance on these programs, the group overall margins increased 80 basis points in 2007 compared with 2006. The company expects sales in the Marine Systems group to increase between 3 and 4 percent in 2008 with margins improving an additional 10 to 20 basis points over 2007. The company expects the group margins to benefit from continued performance improvements in its ship construction programs but to be constrained by a shift in mix away from the later-stage production contracts toward early-stage design and construction work. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 4,940 $ 4,695 $ 245 5.2 % Operating earnings 375 249 126 50.6 % Operating margin 7.6 % 5.3 % 26 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents The Marine Systems group sales increased in 2006 due primarily to a 20 percent increase in volume on ship design and construction contracts for the Navy. In particular, activity was up in 2006 on the T-AKE contract, the Virginia-class submarine program and the LCS program. The group also began the detail design of the DDG-1000 next-generation destroyer in 2006. Offsetting this growth was a scheduled decline in activity on the SSGN submarine conversion program and the completion of the group four-ship commercial tanker program in 2006. The group operating earnings improved substantially in 2006, and operating margins grew 230 basis points over 2005. Program losses in 2005 on the commercial tanker contract and in the group submarine maintenance and overhaul business adversely affected the group operating earnings and margins during that year. Operating earnings and margins in 2006 were favorably impacted by the absence of additional losses on these programs and by improved performance due to labor-hour efficiencies and cost savings on the DDG-51 destroyer construction program. Backlog The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts. The group total backlog at year-end 2007 was $12.1 billion compared with $14 billion at the end of 2006. The group funded backlog at December 31 was $7.6 billion, down from $9.4 billion at year-end 2006. The group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. The current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through 2013. The largest program in the Marine Systems group backlog is the Virginia-class submarine program. The group backlog at year end included $5.5 billion for seven Virginia-class submarines to be delivered through 2013. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, the company reports the entire backlog and sales associated with the program but shares the construction and the earnings equally with its teaming partner. In 2007, Marine Systems received a $270 contract to procure long-lead materials for the first ship of the next (Block III) contract. The Virginia-class program of record is scheduled to include 30 submarines, and the company expects to finalize negotiations of the Block III contract by the end of 2008. The group backlog at the end of 2007 also included $1.3 billion for the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 destroyer program. The backlog includes six DDG destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2011, including two in 2008. In parallel with the completion of the DDG-51 program, the Navy and industry are transitioning to construction of the next-generation guided-missile destroyer, the DDG-1000 Zumwalt Class. The group has one of two contracts for the detail design of the ship, and in 2007, the group received awards totaling approximately $700 from the Navy to complete the design effort and procure long-lead materials for the first ship. The group backlog at year-end 2007 included over $600 for DDG-1000. In February 2008, the Navy awarded the group a contract worth $1.4 billion for the construction of the first DDG-1000, with delivery scheduled in 2014. A significant portion of the group backlog is for the T-AKE combat-logistics ship program. The group backlog at December 31, 2007, included $1.1 billion for the construction of the remaining five ships under the original nine-ship program. In 2007, the Navy awarded the group a contract modification worth $100 to purchase long-lead materials for the 10 th ship, and in January 2008, the Navy exercised a $360 option for the 10 th ship and awarded a $100 modification for long-lead materials for the 11 th ship. Deliveries of these ships are scheduled through 2010. The group backlog at year end also included $1.1 billion for a contract with U.S. Shipping Partners, L.P., for the construction of nine Jones Act product-carrier tankers. The ships are scheduled for delivery between 2009 and 2013. In addition, the Marine Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $1.9 billion in engineering, repair and overhaul programs. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Results of Operations and Outlook Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 Variance Net sales $ 9,622 $ 9,024 $ 598 6.6 % Operating earnings 1,027 976 51 5.2 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.8 % Sales in the Information Systems and Technology group improved in 2007 compared with 2006, and operating earnings topped $1 billion for the first time. The group experienced 11 percent organic growth in its core North American Tactical and Strategic Mission Systems and IT and Mission Services businesses. The IT and Mission Services business also benefitted from the acquisition of Anteon International Corporation (Anteon) in June 2006. These increases were offset partially by a steady but expected decline in volume in the group United Kingdom business, reduced activity in the group Intelligence Mission Systems business and a decline in activity in the commercial wireless market. General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 27 Table of Contents The strong performance in the Tactical and Strategic Mission Systems business was due to higher activity on several command-and-control and communications programs for the U.S. military and increased volume on the group ground-based satellite communications programs. Notable drivers of the volume increase in 2007 included: Combat Operations Centers (COC), which are mobile command-and-control systems used in Iraq; Common Hardware/Software III (CHS-3), which provides commercial and ruggedized computers, network equipment and software to the U.S. armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide; and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), which enables on-the-move satellite connectivity for U.S. and allied forces. Volume was up in the IT and Mission Services business core defense market on the strength of such programs as Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control Equipment and Enhancements (ICE2) and Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS). ICE2 supports critical intelligence and command-and-control systems and networks for U.S. defense and intelligence operations worldwide and was the group largest program in 2007. NETCENTS provides network-centric IT, networking, communications products, systems solutions, and system hardware and software to federal agencies. Sales in the United Kingdom were down 33 percent as a result of the scheduled reduction in activity on the group BOWMAN communications program for the U.K. armed forces. In the group Intelligence Mission Systems business, sales decreased 9 percent in 2007. Approximately a quarter of the decline in sales was due to the loss of a classified program in 2007. Additionally, this business has experienced procurement delays due to a reallocation of defense funding to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The group operating margins were down by 10 basis points compared with 2006 due to the group shift to include more IT services content, including the acquisition of Anteon. The company expects sales growth in the Information Systems and Technology group in 2008 in the 5 to 6 percent range as solid organic growth in the group North American businesses overcomes a further decline in sales in the U.K. operations. The company expects the volume on BOWMAN to decline an additional $50 to $100 in 2008, at which point the program is expected to reach a steady-state volume of ongoing logistics support and sustainment activity for the foreseeable future. The company expects that the group expanding services base will put moderate pressure on margins in 2008, resulting in a slight compression in the group operating margins in the 10 to 20 basis-point range. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Variance Net sales $ 9,024 $ 7,826 $ 1,198 15.3 % Operating earnings 976 865 111 12.8 % Operating margin 10.8 % 11.1 % The Information Systems and Technology group sales and operating earnings increased due to business acquisitions in 2005 and 2006 and modest organic growth in the group North American business. The company acquired Anteon and FC Business Systems, Inc. (FCBS), in 2006 and three smaller acquisitions in the group Tactical and Strategic Mission Systems business in 2005. Overall, the group North American organic sales increased approximately 3 percent in 2006 due to higher activity on several key programs, including ICE2, NETCENTS, CHS-3, the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project and MUOS. Within the group United Kingdom business, sales on the BOWMAN program were down almost 20 percent in 2006 as the company began the transition from production and installation to maintenance and support activities. The group margins in 2006 were down as a result of the lower margins associated with the group expanded service profile. Backlog The Information Systems and Technology group backlog decreased slightly in 2007 to $9.6 billion compared with $10 billion at the end of 2006. At year end, the group funded backlog was $7.2 billion, down from $7.5 billion in 2006. Unlike the company other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards, and relatively few large-scale, long-term programs. The largest program in Information Systems and Technology backlog at year end is the Army Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) program. The group backlog at December 31, 2007, included $900 for WIN-T and its predecessor program, Joint Network Node (JNN). The Army restructured JNN and WIN-T into a single program in 2007. The company is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast, secure, mobile command-and-control capabilities. In 2007, the group received approximately $950 of awards for WIN-T to continue the design and development of the system and provide simulation and training. The group backlog also included approximately $430 for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP). Under the MHP program, the company provides integrated mission systems for 28 state-of-the-art helicopters that are intended to replace Canada aging fleet of marine helicopters. 28 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents Other significant portions of the group year-end backlog include approximately $375 for the U.K. BOWMAN program, $300 for the ICE2 program, $290 for the MUOS program and $210 for CHS-3. The company received $440 in orders on the ICE2 program and over $100 of orders on CHS-3 in 2007. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2007. The group was awarded a contract extension in 2007 worth approximately $100 to continue its support of the U.S. Joint Forces Command Joint Experimentation Program and Joint Futures Lab (JEXP), bringing the total contract value to approximately $375. Under this program, the group is providing engineering, technical and administrative services for joint force concept development. The Department of Homeland Security awarded the Information Systems and Technology group a task order under the Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions (EAGLE) program. Under the task order, which has a potential value of over $225 if all options are exercised, the group provides technology operations and maintenance services (TOMIS) for Citizen and Immigration Services at more than 280 locations nationwide. The group was awarded a contract worth approximately $90 by the Navy to provide modifications and support for fire control systems aboard U.S. and U.K. ballistic missile submarines and for the attack weapons control system aboard U.S. guided missile submarines. The contract has a total potential value of approximately $160 if all options are exercised. The U.K. Royal Air Force awarded the group a contract worth $95 for the tactical data link system of the Tactical Information Exchange Capability (TIEC) program. TIEC provides aircrews with enhanced situational awareness. The group received an initial order worth approximately $25 on a potential $300 contract to provide IT support services to the U.S. Senate. The group also received an initial order of $14 from the Army for support and engineering services on the Command Post of the Future (CPOF) program. The CPOF is an executive-level decision support system providing situational awareness and collaborative tools. This IDIQ program has a potential value of approximately $200. The group backlog does not include approximately $8.7 billion of potential contract value associated with IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The value of these arrangements may be realized over the next 15 years. In 2007, funding under IDIQ contracts contributed over $2.2 billion, or approximately 25 percent of the group IDIQ contract value, to the group funded backlog, most notably from ICE2, CHS-3, JEXP and WIN-T. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2007. The group was selected by the Department of Justice as the system integrator for the Integrated Wireless Network (IWN). IWN is a collaborative effort between the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and the Treasury intended to provide secure, seamless, interoperable and reliable nationwide wireless voice, data and multimedia communications among federal agents and law enforcement officers engaged in disaster response, law enforcement, protective services and homeland defense. IWN is an IDIQ program with a potential value of $10 billion over 15 years, if all options are exercised. In addition, the group received one of 29 General Services Administration (GSA) Alliant contracts to provide federal government agencies with infrastructure, application and IT management services. Alliant is an IDIQ program with a $50 billion ceiling among all awardees over a 10-year period. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options and a portion of the earnings from the company commercial pension plans. Corporate operating expenses totaled $61 in 2007, $47 in 2006 and $6 in 2005. The increase in Corporate operating expense in 2007 and 2006 resulted from the initial recognition of stock option expense in 2006 and an increase in that expense from 2006 to 2007. (See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company stock options.) The company expects 2008 stock option expense of approximately $75. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In the mid-1990s, General Dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment, generating strong cash flow to enable a series of acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses. These acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company customer base. Since 1995, the company has acquired 47 businesses for a total cost of over $16.5 billion. These actions have resulted in a larger, more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility. Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,925 $ 2,128 $ 2,056 Net cash used by investing activities (852 ) (2,316 ) (181 ) Net cash used by financing activities (786 ) (539 ) (520 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents 1,287 (727 ) 1,355 Cash and equivalents at beginning of period 1,604 2,331 976 Cash and equivalents at end of period 2,891 1,604 2,331 Short-term investments 168 Short- and long-term debt (2,791 ) (2,781 ) (3,287 ) Net surplus (debt) (a) $ 268 $ (1,177 ) $ (956 ) Debt-to-equity (b) 23.7 % 28.3 % 40.4 % Debt-to-capital (c) 19.2 % 22.1 % 28.8 % (a) Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and short-term investments.

General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 29 Table of Contents The following is a discussion of the company major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.1 billion in both 2006 and 2005. In each year, the two primary drivers of the company cash flow were net earnings and increasing levels of customer advances and deposits, particularly associated with successive years of record new-aircraft order activity in the Aerospace group. The cash flows from operations in 2007 resulted from the company strong net earnings, the significant deposits received at Gulfstream, and the collection of $270 of contract funds upon the resolution of the T-AKE REA in the Marine Systems group. This significant cash inflow was reduced by a $100 discretionary contribution to the company primary government pension plan. In 2006, net earnings generated the majority of the company operating cash flows, though approximately $150 of the net earnings related to a net gain on the sale of non-core businesses. The cash flow from these transactions is reported in investing activities. The other significant source of cash flow from operations was the substantial deposits received in connection with new business-jet orders. The 2005 cash flows from operations were driven by net earnings and an inflow of customer advances in the company European business. Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991. If, contrary to the company expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained, the company and The Boeing Company could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007. If this were the outcome, the company would owe approximately $1.4 billion pretax. The company after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $670. The company believes it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation, if required, while still retaining ample liquidity. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $852 in 2007, $2.3 billion in 2006 and $181 in 2005. The primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures. In each year, these uses of cash were partially reduced by proceeds from divestiture activities. Business Acquisitions. In 2007, the company completed four acquisitions for a total of $330. In 2006, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of $2.3 billion. In 2005, the company completed three acquisitions for a total of approximately $275. The company financed these acquisitions using commercial paper and/or cash on hand. (See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions.) Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $474 in 2007, $334 in 2006 and $262 in 2005. The increase in 2007 over 2006 resulted from facility improvements in the Aerospace and the Marine Systems groups. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $530 in 2008, less than 2 percent of sales. The company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2007. Sale of Assets. In 2007, the company sold its coal mining operation for approximately $25 in cash, net of taxes. In 2006, the company sold its aggregates business for approximately $315 in cash, net of taxes. In 2005, the company completed the sales of several small, non-core businesses. The company received approximately $300 in cash, net of taxes, from these divestiture activities. Available-for-Sale- Securities. As a result of the company strong cash position during 2007, the company expanded its investments in available-for-sale securities. Net purchases of these securities were $179 in 2007 and $12 in 2006 compared with net sales of $8 in 2005. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $786 in 2007, $539 in 2006 and $520 in 2005. The company typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises. Debt Proceeds, Net. There were no material debt repayments in 2007. In 2006, the company repaid $500 of its fixed-rate debt on the scheduled maturity date. There were no material debt repayments in 2005. The company had no commercial paper outstanding as of the end of each of the past three years. The company has approximately $2 billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon. These facilities are used to provide backup liquidity to the commercial paper program. In the second quarter of 2008, $500 of the company fixed-rate debt securities is scheduled to mature. In addition, $170 of the company senior notes and term debt matures in the second half of 2008. Dividends. The company board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share in March 2007, the 10 th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share in March 2006 and to $0.20 per share in March 2005. Share Repurchases. In 2007, the company repurchased 6.5 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market at an average price of $78 per share. In 2006, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market at an average price of $63 per share. In 2005, the company repurchased 6.7 million shares at an average price of $54 per share. In December 2007, the company board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares of the company outstanding common stock on the open market. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 9.6 million shares remained under this authority approximately 2 percent of the company total shares outstanding. 30 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents Non-GAAP Management Metrics General Dynamics management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. In 2007, for the ninth consecutive year, net cash provided by operating activities significantly exceeded net earnings. The company employed this cash to complete acquisitions, continue its trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase its outstanding shares. As a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, the company return on invested capital (ROIC) increased by 130 basis points during 2007 to 16.9 percent. The company ROIC has grown 450 basis points since 2003. Return on Invested Capital Management believes ROIC is a useful measure for investors, because it reflects the company ability to generate returns from the capital it has deployed in its operations. The company uses ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. Management defines ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC for 2003 through 2007 is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,080 $ 1,710 $ 1,448 $ 1,194 $ 954 After-tax interest expense 89 106 108 106 78 After-tax amortization expense 99 90 70 62 48 Net operating profit after taxes 2,268 1,906 1,626 1,362 1,080 Average debt and equity $ 13,430 $ 12,220 $ 10,948 $ 10,249 $ 8,691 Return on invested capital 16.9 % 15.6 % 14.9 % 13.3 % 12.4 % The company free cash flow from operations was $2.5 billion in 2007, $1.8 billion in each of 2006 and 2005, and $1.5 billion in each of 2004 and 2003. Management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays the company ability to generate cash from its core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends. The company uses free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of its earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 2,952 $ 2,156 $ 2,033 $ 1,760 $ 1,671 Capital expenditures (474 ) (334 ) (262 ) (253 ) (202 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,478 $ 1,822 $ 1,771 $ 1,507 $ 1,469 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 142 % 126 % 140 % 147 % 175 % Free cash flow from operations 119 % 107 % 122 % 126 % 154 % General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 31 Table of Contents Over the past five years, the company has generated free cash flow from operations well in excess of its earnings from continuing operations during the period, an average 122 percent conversion rate. With free cash flow from operations projected to approximate earnings from continuing operations in 2008, the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short- and long-term liquidity needs. Management believes the company has adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Off-balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2007, other than operating leases, the company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities; derivative instruments indexed to the company stock and classified in shareholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; or variable interests in entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the company.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of the company Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the company Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-term contracts and programs, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, pre-owned aircraft 32 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents inventory, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition Government Contracts. The company accounts for sales and earnings under long-term government contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, the company recognizes contract revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered, as applicable. The company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. The company follows the guidelines of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts . However, the company includes revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes (which has been superseded by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ), rather than the cumulative catch-up method. Under the reallocation method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term, while under the cumulative catch-up method such impact would be recognized immediately. If a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified. Anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts, including G&A expenses. The company uses the reallocation method, because management believes the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue, total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on the company long-term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods. Management believes these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches the company revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned. While the company has applied this method consistently for over 30 years, most contractors use the cumulative catch-up method. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently considering a Standard on the hierarchy of GAAP, which, as currently drafted, would eliminate the company ability to use this method of accounting. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion, and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications. Contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years, including future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the timing of product deliveries. These estimates are based on the company best judgment. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company contracts. The company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method. The company recognizes revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, management considers the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. The company recognizes revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance. Business Aircraft . The company accounts for contracts for business-jet aircraft in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1. These contracts usually provide for two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft (i.e., before exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors and optional avionics) and its completion. The company records revenue at two milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer. Goodwill. Since 1995, General Dynamics has acquired 47 businesses at a total cost of over $16.5 billion, including four in 2007. In connection with these acquisitions, the company has recognized $8.9 billion of goodwill. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of the company reporting units, and these estimates require the use of judgment. Management estimates the fair value of the General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report 33 Table of Contents company reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in the company backlog, the company performance and profitability under its contracts, its success in securing future business, and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows. This discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top-down analyses, including a market assessment of the company enterprise value. Beyond the annual impairment test, factors that may lead the company to perform a goodwill impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of the company reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The company has recorded no goodwill impairment to date and does not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future. Commitments and Contingencies. The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of its business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. The company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of the company government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the company estimated workers compensation, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Federal Government Contractors , the company has elected to defer these costs in contracts in process until they are paid, at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. This business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long-term defense programs. The company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under the company contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on management best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of the company remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. The company defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. The company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. The company determines the long-term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on the company best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, future pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. The following hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the company commercial pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on 2007: Increase 25 bps Decrease 25 bps Increase (decrease) to net pension income from: Change in discount rate $ 3 $ (4 ) Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets 3 (3 ) Increase (decrease) to post-retirement benefit cost from: Change in discount rate $ (1 ) $ 1 Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets (1 ) 1 As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, the company contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to the company government retirement plans. As permitted by AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Federal Government Contractors , the company has elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. As such, the company future earnings are not subject to the consequences of annual changes in the assumptions associated with these plans. Management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements . SFAS 157 defines fair value in the context of accounting and financial reporting and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. SFAS 157 also expands the required disclosures regarding fair value measurements. In January 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities to the first quarter of 2009. SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2008. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 34 General Dynamics 2007 Annual Report Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 . SFAS 159 allows companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective in the first quarter of 2008. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations . SFAS 141R changes the requirements for accounting for business combinations, including the determination of purchase price and assignment of purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities. SFAS 141R is effective for acquisitions that are completed in the first quarter of 2009 and beyond. The company is currently analyzing the expected impact of the adoption of this Statement on future acquisitions. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51 . SFAS 160 establishes new accounting for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective in the first quarter of 2009. The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
