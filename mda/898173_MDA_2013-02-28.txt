OVERVIEW We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ( DIY ) and professional service provider customer s. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good , better , and best alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products. Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. As of December 31, 201 2, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact O Reilly and the retail sector in general. We believe that the average consumer tendency has been to trade-down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum. We believe these ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products will result in our customers willingness to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers; however, we cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. 26 We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment. Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. Historically, the long-term trend in the total miles driven in the U.S. has steadily increased; however, according to the Department of Transportation, total miles driven in the U.S. have remained relatively flat since 2007 as the U.S. has experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions. We believe that as the U.S. economy recovers and the level of unemployment declines, annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand f or the industry. Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the U.S. vehicle population also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive afterm arket industry. As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ), the total number of registered vehicles has increase d 15 % ov er the past decade, from 209 million light vehicles in 2001 to 241 million light vehicles in 2011. A nnual new light vehicle registrations, have declined 24 % over the past decade, from 17 million registrations in 2001 to 13 million registrations in 2011; however, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (the SAAR ) of sales of light vehicles in the U.S. increased to 15 million as of December 31, 2012, indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed. As reported by the AAIA, vehicle scrappage rates have decreased 23% from 2001 to 2011, while the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased 21 % over th at decade , from 8.9 years in 2001 to 10.8 y ears in 2011 . We believe this decrease in vehicle scrappage rates and increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors , and the consumer willingness to invest in maintaining their higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures a nd generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. Based on this change in consumer sentiment surrounding the length of time older vehicles can be reliably driven at higher mileages, we believe consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy recovers maintaining the trend of an aging vehicle population. Unemployment - Unemployment rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. The annual U.S. unemployment rate over the past two years has remained at 30-year highs. We believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money, which can be an important factor in the consumer decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle and maintain their existing vehicle. While the deferral of vehicle purchases has led to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long-term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. As of December 31, 2012, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased sli ghtly to 7.8 % fr om 8.5% as of December 31, 2011. We believe that as the economy recovers, unemployment will return to more historic levels and we will see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work. Aided by these increased commuter miles, overall annual U.S. miles driven should begin to grow resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values of customer service and expense control. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below: Under the Company share repurchase program, as approved by the Board of Directors in January of 2011 , the Company may, from time to time , repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. The Company and its Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. The Company Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $ 500 million on each of June 1, 2012, August 10, 2012, and November 12, 2012, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $ 3.0 billion. The additional $ 500 million authorizati ons are effective for a 3-year period, and the most recent authorization expires on November 12, 2015. As of February 28, 2013, we had repurchased approximately 34.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $2.6 billion un der this program. On August 21, 2012, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 ( 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 ) at a price to the public of 99.627% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) as trustee. Interest on the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 27 At the close of business on December 31, 2012, the Company completed the purchase of the auto-parts-related assets of VIP Parts, Tires & Service ( VIP ). The asset purchase included 56 stores located throughout Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, as well as a distribution center located in Lewiston, Maine. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Years ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 49.9 51.0 51.4 Gross profit 50.1 49.0 48.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 34.3 34.1 35.0 Former CSK officer clawback - (0.1) - Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge - - 0.4 Operating income 15.8 15.0 13.2 Interest expense (0.7) (0.5) (0.7) Interest income 0.1 0.1 - Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs - (0.4) - Termination of interest rate swap agreements - (0.1) - Gain on settlement of note receivable - - 0.2 Other income, net - - 0.1 Income before income taxes 15.2 14.1 12.8 Provision for income taxes 5.7 5.3 5.0 Net income 9.5 % 8.8 % 7.8 % 2012 Compared to 2011 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased $ 393 million to $ 6.18 billion from $ 5.79 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7 %. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 3.8 % and 4.6 % for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2012, Compared to the Same Period in 2011 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 215 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2011, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 78 Sales in 2011 for stores that have closed (3) Sales for stores opened throughout 2012 96 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members 7 Total increase in sales $ 393 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Tea m Member s that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. 28 Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2012, was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decrease in DIY customer transaction counts. The improvement in average ticket values was a result of the continued growth of the more costly , hard part categories, as a percentage of our total sales. The growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider customer sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in DIY hard part sales, as consumers continue to maintain and repair their vehicles. The strong increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts, driven by our acquired markets, have been offset by pressured DIY transaction counts. DIY customer transaction counts continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures on disposable income, including sustained unemployment levels above historical averages. Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, which have been manufactured in recent years. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the repair is typically greater. We opened 180 net, new stores and acquired 56 stores during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 170 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states compared to 3,740 stores in 39 states at December 31, 2011. We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 190 net, new stores in 201 3 . Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 3.10 billion (or 50.1 % of sales) from $ 2.84 billion (or 49.0 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9 %. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increases in sales from new stores and the increases in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to distribution center ( DC ) efficiencies, acquisition cost improvements and improved inventory shrinkage, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of the total sales mix. DC efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs. In addition, during 2012 we increased our store-level inventories as a component of our focus on providing higher service levels. The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores were more efficient than routine restocking activity and, as a result, we realized a one-time benefit from capitalized distribution costs. This capitalization of costs benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points versus the prior year, however, we do not anticipate realizing this excess benefit in future periods. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs. The improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks. Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers, therefore, creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG& A ) for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 2.12 billion (or 34.3 % of sales) from $ 1.97 billion (or 34.1 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7 %. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The slight increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our focus on store staffing levels to continue to deliver industry-leading customer service while adjusting to the slower sales environment, as well as an overall deleverage on soft comparable store sales. Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, o perating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 977 million (or 15.8 % of sales) from $ 867 million (or 15.0 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13 %. Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, de creased to $ 36 million (or 0.6 % of sales), from $ 51 million (or 0.9 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 30 % . The decrease in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily due to one-time charges related to our financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), partially offset by increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as compared to the prior year. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 356 million ( 37.8 % effective tax rate) from $ 308 million ( 37.8 % effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15 % . The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $ 586 million (or 9.5 % of sales), from $ 508 million (or 8.8 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15 %. 29 Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 28 % to $ 4.75 on 123 million shares from $ 3.71 on 137 million shares for the same period one year ago. The impact of share repurchases during 2012 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately $ 0.26 . Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK for SEC purposes , of $ 3 million ($ 2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer. This clawback amount was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011. The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $ 22 million ($ 13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $ 4 million ($ 3 million, net of tax). The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in Other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 13 % to $ 977 million (or 15.8 % of sales) from $ 864 million (or 14.9 % of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 12 % to $ 586 million (or 9.5 % of sales) from $ 522 million (or 9.0 % of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 25 % to $ 4.75 from $ 3.81 for the same period one year ago.

We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, and the former CSK officer clawback, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 30 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased $ 391 million to $ 5.79 billion from $ 5.40 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7 %. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.6 % and 8.8 % for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2011, Compared to the Same Period in 2010 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 241 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2010, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 70 Sales in 2010 for stores that have closed (13) Sales for stores opened throughout 2011 82 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members 11 Total increase in sales $ 391 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts. The improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced, hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales, and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs, which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period. The growth in the hard part categories was driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in DIY sales to the hard part categories. During the year, DIY customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages, which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts. We opened 170 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 149 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, we operated 3,740 stores in 39 states compared to 3,570 stores in 38 states at December 31, 2010. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 2.84 billion (or 49.0 % of sales) from $ 2.62 billion (or 48.6 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8 %. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable product mix, improved acquisition costs, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution center efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of the total sales mix. The improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a high gross profit as a percentage of sales. Increasing hard part sales is the result of strong demand as consumers retain and maintain their vehicles beyond manufacturer warranty periods and our strong growth in sales to professional service providers in the acquired markets. The improved shrinkage wa s driven by our converted CSK stores, which are now managed using the O Reilly point-of-sale system ( POS ), installed in all CSK stores as they converted to the O Reilly distribution systems throughout 2009 and 2010. The O Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory, resulting in improved inventory shrinkage. Distribution center efficiencies we re the result of leverage on increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced distribution center Team Members in our newer DCs. Professional service provider sales in the acquired CSK markets grew at a faster rate than total DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in those markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy. Professional service provider sales typically carry a lower overall gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service providers, consequently creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. 31 Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 1.97 billion (or 34.1 % of sales) from $ 1.89 billion (or 35.0 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5 %. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales, improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits, partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business. Operating income: Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 867 million (or 15.0 % of sales) from $ 713 million (or 13.2 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 22 %. The increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above, as well as $ 3 million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and a forme r CSK of ficer that resulted in the reimbursement to CSK of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer (discussed in detail below see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements) versus a $21 million charge to operating income in the prior year, related to the previously announced legacy United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) investigation of CSK (discussed in detail below see Note 12 Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG&A from strong comparable store sales. Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 51 million (or 0.9 % of sales), from $ 23 million (or 0.4 % of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 118 %. The increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to one-time charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates, facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period. In addition, during 2010, we recognized a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $ 12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK (discussed in detail below). Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 308 million ( 37.8 % effective tax rate) from $ 270 million ( 39.2 % effective tax rate) for the same period in the prior year , representing an increase of 14 %. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the $ 21 million charge recorded in 2010 related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation, discussed in detail below, which was not deductible for tax purposes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased to $ 508 million (or 8.8 % of sales), from $ 419 million (or 7.8 % of sales) for the same period in the prior year , representing an increase of 21 %. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 26 % to $ 3.71 on 137 million shares from $ 2.95 on 142 million shares for the same period in the prior year . The impact of share repurchases during 2011 on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately $ 0.19 . Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK for SEC purposes , of $ 3 million ($ 2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer. This clawback amount was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011. The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $ 22 million ($ 13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $ 4 million ($ 3 million, net of tax). The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in Other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2010, included a nonrecurring, non-operating gain in Other income (expense) of $ 12 million ($ 7 million, net of tax) related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the CSK acquisition, as well as a charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation into CSK pre-acquisition historical accounting practices. We accrued $ 21 million during 2010 in anticipation of executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement ( NPA ) among the DOJ, CSK and O Reilly and paying a one-time monetary penalty of $ 21 million. During the third quarter of 2011, the NPA was executed and the previously recorded, one-time $ 21 million penalty was paid to the DOJ on behalf of CSK. The charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ 32 investigation was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 18 % to $ 864 million (or 14.9 % of sales) from $ 734 million (or 13.6 % of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 21 % to $ 522 million (or 9.0 % of sales) from $ 433 million (or 8.0 % of sales) for the same period in the prior year . Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased 25 % to $ 3.81 from $ 3.05 for the same period in the prior year .

We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, the former CSK officer clawback, the charges for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our Revolving Credit Facility . Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility . We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. 33 Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in millions): December 31, Percentage Liquidity and Related Ratios 2012 2011 Change Current assets $ 2,733 $ 2,608 4.8 % Quick assets (1) 429 565 (24.1) % Current liabilities 2,273 1,580 43.9 % Working capital (2) 460 1,028 (55.3) % Total debt 1,096 798 37.3 % Total equity 2,108 2,845 (25.9) % Current ratio (3) 1.20:1 1.65:1 (27.3) % Quick ratio (4) 0.20:1 0.39:1 (48.7) % Debt to equity (5) 0.52:1 0.28:1 85.7 % (1) Quick assets include cash, cash equivalents and receivables. (2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. (4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities. (5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by shareholders equity. Current liabilities increased 44%, t otal de bt increased 37% and total equity decreased 26% from 2011 to 2012. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing program and the additional vendor participation during the year. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 84.7% as of December 31, 2012, as compared to 64.4% one year prior. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of our unsecured $300 million 3.800% Senior Notes during 2012. The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paid-in-capital from the proceeds of stock option exercises, and related tax benefits, executed under our director and employee share-based compensation plans. The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, Liquidity 2012 2011 2010 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,251,555 $ 1,118,991 $ 703,687 Investing activities (317,407) (319,653) (351,277) Financing activities (1,047,572) (467,507) (349,624) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (113,424) $ 331,831 $ 2,786 Capital expenditures $ 300,719 $ 328,319 $ 365,419 Free cash flow (a) 950,836 790,672 338,268 (a) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period. Operating activities: The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges and the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011), decreases in net inventory investment and other assets and increases in income taxes payable (adjusted for the effect of non-cash change in deferred income taxes and the excess tax benefit from stock options exercised) and other current liabilities. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs. Our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 84.7% and 64.4% at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in other assets was primarily the result of the timing of payments from vendors for receivables due to the Company under various programs. The increase in income taxes payable, adjusted for the non-cash impacts discussed above, was primarily the result of the prepayment of income taxes during 2011. The increase in other current 34 liabilities was primarily the result of the payment, during 2011, for the one-time monetary penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation. Th e increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 compared to 2010 wa s primarily due to strong net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011 and deferred income taxes) and a significant decrease in net inventory investment, partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities (driven by the payment of the one-time penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation). Our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 64.4% and 44.3% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of $37 million during the year, despite the fact that we opened 170 new stores during the year. Investing activities: The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2012, partially offset by small acquisitions during the year. Total c apital expenditures were $ 301 million, $ 328 million, and $ 365 million in 2012, 2011, and 20 10, respectively . The decrease in capital expenditures during 2012, as compared to 2011, was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased stores opened. We were able to find real estate with attractive lease factors during 2012 and as a result, opened a larger number of leased locations during 2012 as compared to the year prior. Opening a new store in a leased location requires a smaller capital investment than opening an owned location. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures. During 2010, we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the CSK markets and the conversion of the CSK stores to the O Reilly POS, resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during 2011. We opened 180 , 170 , and 149 net, new stores in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively , and acquired 56 stores in 2012 . We plan to open 190 net, new stores in 2013. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $ 1.7 million to $ 1.9 million ; however, suc h costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site . Financing activities: The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2012, in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program and greater net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2011, partially offset by an increase in the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under the Company incentive programs and the related tax benefits during 2012. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2011 in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program, which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in 2011 as compared to net repayments under our facilities during 2010. The net borrowings in 2011 are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 and our 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 in January and September of 2011, respectively, partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous ABL Credit Facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. The net repayments under our facilities in 2010 were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured ABL Credit Facility. Credit facilities: On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $ 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility ) arranged by BA and Barclays Capital, which was scheduled to mature in January of 2016. During 2011, we amended the unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which decreased the facility to $ 660 million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The amendment also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September of 2016. In conjunction with the amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of $ 0.3 million, which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $ 200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $ 75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $ 200 million. We had stand-by letters of credit, primarily to satisfy workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $ 57 million and $ 60 million as of December 13, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. On July 11, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in July of 2013. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $ 356 million under the ABL Credit Facility, of 35 which $ 106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract. All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid, and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on January 14, 2011, and the ABL Credit Facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4.875 % Senior Notes due 2021, as further described below. In conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $ 22 million and a one-time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of $ 4 million, which are included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Senior Notes: 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021: On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875 % Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.297 % of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) as trustee. Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, which began on July 14, 2011, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021: On September 19, 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625 % Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.826 % of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year , which began on March 15, 2012, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 On August 21, 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.800 % Senior Notes due 2022 ( 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 ) at a price to the public of 99.627 % of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering, with the remainder intended to be used to repay borrowings outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries ( Subsidiary Guarantors ) that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our Revolving C redit F acility or certain of our other debt or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the subsidiary guarantor guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sales or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all of the property of, the subsidiary guarantor . Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31 , 201 2 . Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains covenants, including limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility , a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0 0 times through December 31, 2012; 2.25 times through December 31, 2014; 2.5 0 times through maturity; and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 3. 0 0 times through maturity. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option compensation expense ( EBITDAR ) to adjusted debt. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken against us, including but not limited to possible termination of credit extensions, immediate payment of outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and litigation from our lenders. We had a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.95 times and 4.86 times as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio of 1.83 times and 1.75 times as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio range of 2. 0 0 times to 2.25 times. 36 The table below outlines the calculations of the fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 GAAP net income $ 585,746 $ 507,673 Add: Interest expense 40,200 28,165 Rent expense 240,869 230,897 Provision for income taxes 355,775 308,100 Depreciation expense 176,705 164,579 Amortization expense 401 1,301 Non-cash share-based compensation 22,026 20,579 Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs - 21,626 Non-GAAP adjusted net income (EBITDAR) $ 1,421,722 $ 1,282,920 Interest expense $ 40,200 $ 28,165 Capitalized interest 6,064 4,666 Rent expense 240,869 230,897 Total fixed charges $ 287,133 $ 263,728 Fixed charge coverage ratio 4.95 4.86 GAAP debt $ 1,095,956 $ 797,574 Stand-by letters of credit 57,281 59,917 Discount on senior notes 4,366 3,683 Six-times rent expense 1,445,214 1,385,382 Non-GAAP adjusted debt $ 2,602,817 $ 2,246,556 Adjusted consolidated leverage ratio 1.83 1.75 The fixed charge coverage ratio and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio, adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR and free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Share repurchase program: Under our share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. We may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. During 2012, our Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the cumulative authorization amount to $ 3.0 billion. The most recent $ 500 million authorization is effective for a three-year period and expires November 12, 2015. Each prior $500 million authorization was effective for a three-year period beginning on the date of the additional authorization. The following table identifies shares of the Company common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Shares repurchased 16,201 15,877 Average price per share $ 89.20 $ 61.49 Total investment $ 1,445,044 $ 976,322 37 Subsequent to the end of the year and through the date of this filing, we repurchased an add itional 2.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of $ 90.09 for a total investment of $ 186 million. We have repurchased a total of 34.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 through and including February 28, 2013, at an average price of $ 76.37 for a total aggregate investment of $ 2.6 billio n. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 201 2 , included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 5 Leasing and Note 11 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments pri marily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility . Deferred income taxes , which is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory , are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 201 3 , which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments Due By Period Total Before 1 Year 1 to 2 Years 3 to 4 Years Years 5 and Over (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 1,546,063 $ 49,650 $ 99,300 $ 99,300 $ 1,297,813 Future minimum lease payments under capital leases (2) 336 234 102 - - Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 1,843,100 240,040 429,833 332,437 840,790 Other obligations 2,400 600 1,200 600 - Self-insurance reserves (3) 122,866 54,191 34,424 18,042 16,209 Construction commitments 89,305 89,305 - - - Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,604,070 $ 434,020 $ 564,859 $ 450,379 $ 2,154,812 (1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $660 million and matures in September of 2016 , bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.975 % to 1.6 00% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0. 000 % to 0.6 00% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services , subject to limited exceptions . Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.150% to 0.400% based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services , subject to limited exceptions . Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans is 0.200%, our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 1.200% and our facility fee is 0.175% . As of December 31, 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payment s. (3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities, however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 14 In come Taxes to the C onsolidated F inancial S tatements. These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 201 2 , we recorded a liability of $ 59 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities . OFF - BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off - balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the enti ty that is not recorded in our c onsolidated financial statements. W e have historically utilized various off - balance sheet financial instruments , including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into 38 any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $ 200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility . Th o s e letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $ 57 million and $ 60 million were outstanding at December 31, 201 2 and 20 11 , respectively. Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See Contractual Obligations and N ote 11 C ommitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating leases. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and DCs. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink changed 10 % from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1 % of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. Accounts Receivable We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10 % from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1 % of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 201 2 . Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when ever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of 39 the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter , or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 201 2 , nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10 % from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. Vendor C oncessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Warrant y Reserves W e offer warranties on certain merchandise we sel l with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our vendors. Certain vendors provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between vendor allowances received i n lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10 % from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $3 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. Self-Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value , using a credit-adjusted discount rate . These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self- insurance reserves were changed 10 % from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 11 million or 1.2 % of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. 40 Closed Property Reserves We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10 % from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1 % of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O Reilly is currently involved. We are curre ntly involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business . We resolv ed the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against CSK and certain of CSK former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we incur red legal fees and costs related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2012, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2012. Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. QUAR T ERL Y RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 201 2 and 201 1 . The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein. 41 Fiscal 2012 First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data) Comparable store sales 6.1 % 2.5 % 1.3 % 4.2 % Sales $ 1,529,392 $ 1,562,849 $ 1,601,558 $ 1,488,385 Gross profit 761,680 779,861 805,493 750,384 Operating income 247,501 243,603 263,318 222,971 Net income 147,492 146,120 159,332 132,802 Earnings per share basic $ 1.16 $ 1.17 $ 1.34 $ 1.16 Earnings per share assuming dilution $ 1.14 $ 1.15 $ 1.32 $ 1.14 Fiscal 2011 First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data) Comparable store sales 5.7 % 4.4 % 4.8 % 3.3 % Sales $ 1,382,738 $ 1,479,318 $ 1,535,453 $ 1,391,307 Gross profit 669,781 718,661 754,210 694,697 Former CSK officer clawback - - - (2,798) Operating income 196,437 222,368 241,050 206,911 Write-off of debt issuance costs (21,626) - - - Termination of interest rate swap agreements (4,237) - - - Net income 102,474 133,772 148,439 122,988 Earnings per share basic $ 0.73 $ 0.97 $ 1.12 $ 0.96 Earnings per share assuming dilution $ 0.72 $ 0.96 $ 1.10 $ 0.94 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February of 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2013-02, "Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" ( ASU 2013-02 ). Under ASU 2013-02, an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements. We plan to adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ended March 31, 2013; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore, is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
