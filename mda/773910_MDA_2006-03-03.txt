Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General Anadarko Petroleum Corporation primary line of business is the exploration, development, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company major areas of operations are located in the United States, Canada and Algeria. The Company is also active in Venezuela, Qatar and several other countries. The Company focus is on adding high-margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of exploring for and producing oil and gas. The primary factors that affect the Company results of operations include, among other things, commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, production volumes, the Company ability to find additional oil and gas reserves, as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations. During 2004, Anadarko implemented an asset realignment that resulted in the Company completing over $3 billion in pretax asset sales of certain non-core properties in the latter half of 2004 through a series of unrelated transactions. Combined, the divested properties represented about 11% of Anadarko year-end 2003 proved reserves and about 20% of 2004 oil and gas production. The Company used proceeds from these asset sales to reduce debt, repurchase Anadarko common stock and otherwise to have funds available for reinvestment in other strategic options. Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Selected Data 2005 2004 2003 millions except per share amounts Financial Results Revenues $ 7,100 $ 6,079 $ 5,113 Costs and expenses 3,085 3,186 2,914 Interest expense and other (income) expense 120 416 225 Income tax expense 1,424 871 729 Net income available to common stockholders $ 2,466 $ 1,601 $ 1,287 Earnings per share diluted $ 10.39 $ 6.36 $ 5.09 Operating Results Total proved reserves (MMBOE) 2,449 2,367 2,513 Worldwide proved reserve additions (MMBOE) 291 335 391 Proved reserve sales in place (MMBOE) 51 290 14 Annual sales volumes (MMBOE) 158 190 192 Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash flow from operating activities $ 4,146 $ 3,207 $ 3,043 Capital expenditures 3,437 3,090 2,792 Total debt 3,677 3,840 5,058 Stockholders equity $ 11,051 $ 9,285 $ 8,599 Debt to total capitalization ratio 25 % 29 % 37 % Financial Results Net Income Anadarko net income available to common stockholders for 2005 totaled $2.5 billion, or $10.39 per share (diluted), compared to net income available to common stockholders for 2004 of $1.6 billion, or $6.36 per share (diluted). Anadarko had net income available to common stockholders in 2003 of $1.3 billion or $5.09 per share (diluted). The increase in 2005 net income was primarily due to higher net realized commodity prices and lower expenses, partially offset by lower volumes associated with divestitures in late 2004. The increases in earnings per share were also due to lower average shares outstanding in 2005 as a result of stock 28 Table of Contents repurchases in late 2004 and throughout 2005. The increase in net income in 2004 was primarily due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by higher expenses. In 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and the related cumulative adjustment in the first quarter of 2003 increased net income $47 million or $0.18 per share (diluted). Revenues 2005 2004 2003 millions Gas sales $ 3,709 $ 3,298 $ 2,842 Oil and condensate sales 2,838 2,211 1,787 Natural gas liquids sales 457 460 365 Other sales 96 110 119 Total $ 7,100 $ 6,079 $ 5,113 Anadarko total revenues for 2005 increased 17% compared to 2004 and total revenues for 2004 increased 19% compared to 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher net commodity prices and higher sales volumes from core oil and gas properties, partially offset by lower volumes resulting from the divestiture of non-core properties in late 2004. The increase in revenues in 2004 was primarily due to significantly higher commodity prices, partially offset by slightly lower sales volumes. The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage the risk of a decrease in the market prices for its anticipated sales of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs. This activity is referred to as price risk management. The impact of price risk management and marketing activities decreased total gas, oil and condensate revenues $204 million during 2005 compared to a decrease of $442 million in 2004. For 2005, these activities resulted in $0.07 per Mcf lower natural gas prices and $3.01 per barrel lower oil prices compared to market prices. For 2004, these activities resulted in $0.24 per Mcf lower natural gas prices and $4.37 per barrel lower oil prices compared to market prices. In 2003, the impact of price risk management and marketing activities decreased total gas, oil and condensate revenues $274 million. For 2003, these activities resulted in $0.28 per Mcf lower natural gas prices and $1.42 per barrel lower oil prices compared to market prices.

This decrease was partially offset by higher volumes associated with successful drilling onshore in the United States, facility expansion in Alaska and higher volumes in Algeria. During 2004, Anadarko daily sales volumes decreased slightly compared to 2003 primarily due to the 29 Table of Contents divestitures in late 2004, partially offset by higher volumes in Algeria due to the expansion of production facilities and the timing of cargo liftings. Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future.

Natural Gas Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2005 2004 2003 United States (Bcf) 414 499 503 MMcf/d 1,136 1,363 1,379 Price per Mcf $ 7.16 $ 5.18 $ 4.34 Canada (Bcf) 102 138 140 MMcf/d 278 378 383 Price per Mcf $ 7.29 $ 5.17 $ 4.71 Total (Bcf) 516 637 643 MMcf/d 1,414 1,741 1,762 Price per Mcf $ 7.19 $ 5.18 $ 4.42 Anadarko daily natural gas sales volumes in 2005 were down 19% compared to 2004 primarily due to the impact of divestitures in the United States and Canada in late 2004, partially offset by higher volumes associated with successful drilling onshore in the United States. The Company daily natural gas sales volumes for 2004 were down slightly compared to 2003 primarily due to slightly lower sales volumes in the United States due to the impact of divestitures in late 2004 and natural production declines in areas that were targeted for divestiture, partially offset by higher volumes associated with successful drilling onshore in the United States. Production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand. The Company average natural gas price in 2005 increased 39% compared to 2004. The increase in prices in 2005 is attributed to continued strong demand in North America and an active hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico impacting supply and infrastructure. The higher prices include the impact of price risk management activities on 22% of natural gas sales volumes during 2005 that reduced the Company exposure to low prices and limited participation in higher prices. The Company average natural gas price in 2004 increased 17% compared to 2003. Continued strong demand in North America contributed to higher natural gas prices. The higher prices in 2004 include the impact of price risk management activities on 36% of natural gas sales volumes during 2004. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had only 1% of its anticipated natural gas wellhead sales volumes for 2006 subject to derivative instruments associated with price risk management. See Energy Price Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10-K. 30 Table of Contents Crude Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2005 2004 2003 United States (MMBbls) 24 32 34 MBbls/d 68 88 93 Price per barrel $ 44.35 $ 31.65 $ 26.14 Canada (MMBbls) 3 5 6 MBbls/d 7 14 17 Price per barrel $ 49.48 $ 37.37 $ 27.42 Algeria (MMBbls) 24 22 19 MBbls/d 65 61 52 Price per barrel $ 54.38 $ 34.78 $ 28.43 Other International (MMBbls) 8 8 8 MBbls/d 22 22 22 Price per barrel $ 39.37 $ 27.91 $ 23.15 Total (MMBbls) 59 67 67 MBbls/d 162 185 184 Price per barrel $ 47.92 $ 32.66 $ 26.55 Anadarko daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2005 decreased 12% compared to 2004 due to the impact of divestitures in the United States and Canada in late 2004. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes in the United States associated with expansion of production facilities in Alaska and successful drilling in the western states and higher volumes in Algeria. Anadarko daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2004 were essentially flat with 2003. Higher sales volumes in Algeria and production startup in mid-2004 at the Marco Polo deepwater platform were mostly offset by lower sales volumes in the United States and Canada, due to the impact of divestitures in late 2004 and natural production declines in areas that were targeted for divestitures. Production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand. Anadarko average crude oil price in 2005 increased 47% compared to 2004. The higher crude oil prices in 2005 were attributed to continued political unrest in the Middle East, increased worldwide demand and the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico on oil production and infrastructure. The higher prices in 2005 include the impact of price risk management activities on 28% of crude oil and condensate sales volumes that reduced the Company exposure to low prices and limited participation in higher prices. The Company average crude oil price in 2004 increased 23% compared to 2003. The higher crude oil prices in 2004 were attributed to continuing political unrest in the Middle East and increased worldwide demand. The higher prices include the impact of price risk management activities on 36% of crude oil and condensate sales volumes during 2004. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had less than 1% of its anticipated oil and condensate volumes for 2006 subject to derivative instruments associated with price risk management. Natural Gas Liquids Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2005 2004 2003 Total (MMBbls) 13 17 17 MBbls/d 36 45 47 Price per barrel $ 34.53 $ 27.76 $ 21.18 Anadarko daily NGLs sales volumes in 2005 were down 20% compared to 2004, primarily due to the impact of divestitures in the United States in late 2004. The Company 2004 daily NGLs sales volumes were down slightly compared to 2003, primarily due to a decrease in volumes of natural gas processed. During 2005, average NGLs prices increased 24% compared to 2004. The 2004 average NGLs prices increased 31% compared to 2003. NGLs production is dependent on natural gas and NGLs prices as well as the economics of processing the natural gas to extract NGLs. 31 Table of Contents Costs and Expenses 2005 2004 2003 millions Direct operating $ 544 $ 682 $ 630 Transportation and cost of product 302 250 198 General and administrative 442 423 392 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,343 1,447 1,297 Other taxes 376 312 294 Impairments related to oil and gas properties 78 72 103 Total $ 3,085 $ 3,186 $ 2,914 During 2005, Anadarko costs and expenses decreased 3% compared to 2004 due to the following factors: Direct operating expense was down $126 million primarily due to the impact of properties divested in late 2004 and down $12 million due to 2004 severance and other costs related to divestitures and reorganization efforts. Transportation and cost of product expense increased 21% primarily due to higher transportation expenses and NGLs transportation, fractionation and processing costs. The $28 million increase in transportation cost was primarily due to a change in the Company marketing strategy whereby the Company is transporting a higher percentage of its natural gas volumes to higher priced markets. The $12 million increase in NGLs transportation and fractionation cost was primarily due to a change in the Company marketing strategy whereby the Company is fractionating its raw NGLs stream into the individual products in order to obtain higher sales proceeds for NGLs. Cost of product was up about $12 million primarily due to higher NGLs processing costs as a result of increased natural gas prices. These cost increases are offset by higher natural gas, NGLs and other sales revenues. General and administrative (G&A) expense increased 4% primarily due to an increase of $51 million in compensation, pension and other postretirement benefits expenses attributed primarily to the rising cost of attracting and retaining a highly qualified workforce, including the Company decision to provide a more performance-based compensation program to a broader base of employees. This increase also reflects the continued upward pressure on benefits expenses, including the impact of lower discount rates on estimated pension and other postretirement benefits expenses. Consulting, audit, rent and other miscellaneous expenses combined increased by $14 million. These increases were partially offset by a $28 million decrease in legal expenses and a decrease of $19 million due to 2004 severance and other costs related to divestitures and reorganization efforts. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense decreased 7%. DD&A expense includes decreases of $242 million related to lower production volumes and $11 million related to lower asset retirement obligation accretion expense, both primarily due to the impact of 2004 divested properties. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $149 million primarily due to higher costs associated with finding and developing oil and gas reserves (including the transfer of excluded costs to the DD&A pool). Other taxes increased 21% primarily due to higher net realized commodity prices, partially offset by the impact of properties divested in 2004. Impairments of oil and gas properties in 2005 include $35 million related to unsuccessful exploration activities in Tunisia, $30 million related to exploration activities at various international locations and $13 million related to the disposition of properties in Oman. During 2004, Anadarko costs and expenses increased 9% compared to 2003 due to the following factors: Direct operating expense, which was up 8% in 2004, includes $12 million in severance and other costs related to 2004 divestiture and reorganization efforts. Excluding these costs, direct operating expenses increased 6% primarily due to higher enhanced oil recovery activity in the western states, production beginning in mid-2004 at the Marco Polo platform, the acquisition of producing properties in mid-2003 and a general increase in service and gathering costs, partially offset by a decrease associated with property divestitures in late 2004. 32 Table of Contents Transportation and cost of product expense increased 26%. The increase includes a $60 million increase in transportation expense due to higher transportation rates and marketing volumes. This increase was partially offset by a lower cost of product as a result of a decrease in gas volumes processed into NGLs. G&A expense increased 8%. In 2004, G&A expense included $19 million in severance and other costs related to 2004 divestitures and reorganization efforts. In 2003, G&A expense included $40 million in restructuring costs related to a cost reduction plan implemented in July and $32 million in benefits and salaries expenses related to executive transitions. Excluding these costs, G&A expense increased 26% in 2004 primarily due to legal settlements of $37 million and an increase of $30 million in employee bonus plan expense primarily due to the Company exceeding internal performance goals. DD&A expense increased 12%. DD&A expense increases include about $145 million primarily due to higher costs associated with finding and developing oil and gas reserves (including the transfer of excluded costs to the DD&A pool) and $11 million due to higher depreciation of general properties and asset retirement obligation accretion expense, partially offset by a decrease of $6 million related to slightly lower production volumes. Other taxes increased 6% primarily due to higher commodity prices in 2004. Impairments of oil and gas properties in 2004 were due to a $62 million ceiling test impairment for Qatar as a result of lower future production estimates and unsuccessful exploration activities and $10 million related to other international activities. Interest Expense and Other (Income) Expense 2005 2004 2003 millions Interest Expense Gross interest expense $ 270 $ 334 $ 366 Premium and related expenses for early retirement of debt 104 8 Capitalized interest (69 ) (86 ) (121 ) Net interest expense 201 352 253 Other (Income) Expense Operating lease settlement 63 Firm transportation keep-whole contract valuation (56 ) (1 ) (9 ) Interest income (27 ) (16 ) (3 ) Foreign currency exchange (gains) losses 2 (19 ) Other 2 16 3 Total Other (Income) Expense (81 ) 64 (28 ) Total $ 120 $ 416 $ 225 Interest Expense Anadarko gross interest expense decreased 19% during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to lower average outstanding debt. Interest expense for 2004 included $104 million of premiums and related expenses for the early retirement of debt in 2004. Gross interest expense in 2004 decreased 9% compared to 2003 due to lower average outstanding debt. Debt has decreased $1.4 billion since December 31, 2003. See Capital Resources and Liquidity. In 2005, capitalized interest decreased by 20% compared to 2004. In 2004, capitalized interest decreased by 29% compared to 2003. The 2005 and 2004 decreases were primarily due to lower capitalized costs that qualify for interest capitalization. For additional information about the Company policies regarding costs excluded and capitalized interest see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Costs Excluded and Capitalized Interest. Other (Income) Expense For 2005, the Company had other income of $81 million compared to other expense of $64 million for 2004. The favorable change of $145 million was primarily due to a $63 million loss in 2004 related to an operating lease settlement for the Corpus Christi West Plant Refinery, a favorable change of $55 million related to the effect of higher market values for firm transportation subject to the keep-whole agreement, a $14 million favorable change in other, primarily related to environmental remediation expense in 2004, and an increase in interest income of $11 million. 33 Table of Contents For 2004, the Company had other expense of $64 million compared to other income of $28 million for 2003. The unfavorable change of $92 million was primarily due to a $63 million loss in 2004 related to the operating lease settlement, a $21 million unfavorable change primarily due to a decrease in Canadian foreign currency exchange gains and an $8 million unfavorable change related to the effect of lower market values for firm transportation subject to the keep-whole agreement.

Income Tax Expense 2005 2004 2003 millions except percentages Income tax expense $ 1,424 $ 871 $ 729 Effective tax rate 37 % 35 % 37 % For 2005, income taxes increased 63% compared to 2004 primarily due to higher income before income taxes. For 2004, income taxes increased 19% compared to 2003 primarily due to higher income before income taxes, partially offset by the effect of the reduction in the Alberta provincial tax rate during 2004 and other items. The variances from the 35% statutory rate and the variances between years are caused by income taxes related to foreign activities, state income taxes, cross border financing, Canadian income tax rate reduction, excess U.S. foreign tax credits generated in the current year and other items. Current tax expense related to the estimated taxable gains from the 2004 divestitures was recorded during 2004 with a corresponding reduction to deferred tax expense. As a result, total income tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2004 were not impacted by the divestitures. Operating Results Proved Reserves Anadarko focuses on growth and profitability. Reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves, among other factors. Reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties. 2005 2004 2003 MMBOE Proved Reserves Beginning of year 2,367 2,513 2,328 Reserve additions and revisions 291 335 391 Sales in place (51 ) (290 ) (14 ) Production (158 ) (191 ) (192 ) End of year 2,449 2,367 2,513 Proved Developed Reserves Beginning of year 1,517 1,727 1,568 End of year 1,524 1,517 1,727 The Company proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2005 were 7.9 Tcf compared to 7.5 Tcf at year-end 2004 and 7.7 Tcf at year-end 2003. Anadarko proved crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves at year-end 2005 were 1.1 billion barrels compared to 1.1 billion barrels at year-end 2004 and 1.2 billion barrels at year-end 2003. Crude oil, condensate and NGLs comprised about half of the Company proved reserves at year-end 2005, 2004 and 2003. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Company engineers, are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. The available data reviewed include, among other things, seismic data, structure and isopach maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, reservoir pressures, individual well and field performance data, individual well and field projections, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs and product prices. Revisions are 34 Table of Contents necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. Reserve Additions and Revisions During 2005, the Company added 291 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (extensions, discoveries, improved recovery and purchases in place) and revisions. Additions During 2005, Anadarko added 314 MMBOE of proved reserves. Of this amount, 309 MMBOE were added as a result of successful drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and fields in the north Louisiana Vernon, east Texas Bossier, west Texas Haley and Canadian Wild River areas and successful improved recovery operations in Wyoming. During 2004, Anadarko added 389 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of successful drilling in its core onshore North American properties and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, successful improved recovery operations in Wyoming and minor producing property acquisitions. During 2003, Anadarko added 396 MMBOE of proved reserves through successful drilling in its core North American properties, successful improved recovery operations in Wyoming and producing property acquisitions. The Company expects the majority of future reserve additions to come from extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in North America and the deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as through improved recovery operations, purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas. The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future. Revisions Total revisions in 2005 were (23) MMBOE or 1% of the beginning of year reserve base. Performance revisions of (36) MMBOE included the impact of government imposed limits on production in Venezuela, as well as a reduction of NGLs reserves in Algeria resulting from a change in project scope, which improved the value of the project but decreased the ultimate reserves recovery. North America, which represents 84% of the Company proved reserves, had a (1) MMBOE or negative 0.1% performance revision from the year-end 2004 proved reserves. A (6) MMBOE revision in Canada was almost entirely offset by a 5 MMBOE revision in the United States. Price revisions of 14 MMBOE were primarily due to the impact of higher year-end prices, partially offset by the impact of recalculating the equity barrels under the service contract in Venezuela as a result of higher prices. Total revisions for 2004 and 2003 were (54) MMBOE and (5) MMBOE, respectively. Revisions in 2004 related primarily to performance revisions of the Company reserves at Marco Polo and other properties, partially offset by positive revisions in other areas. An analysis of Anadarko proved reserve revisions split between performance and price revisions and shown as a percentage of the previous year-end proved reserves is presented in the following graph. During the 10-year period 1996 2005, Anadarko annual reserve revisions, up or down, have been below 5% of the previous year-end proved reserve base for both types of revisions. The Company believes this is an indicator of the validity of the Company processes for estimating reserves. In the aggregate, over the past decade, the average reserve revision has been a negative 0.7% and the average performance-related reserve revision has been a negative 0.6%.

In 2004, Anadarko sold properties located in the United States and Canada representing 226 MMBOE and 64 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. In 2003, Anadarko sold properties in the United States and Canada representing 8 MMBOE and 6 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. Proved Undeveloped Reserves To improve investor confidence and provide transparency regarding the Company reserves, Anadarko reports the status of its proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) annually. The Company annually reviews all PUDs, with a particular focus on those PUDs that have been booked for three or more years, to ensure that there is an appropriate plan for development. Generally, onshore United States PUDs are converted to proved developed reserves within two years. Certain projects, such as improved oil recovery, arctic development, deepwater development and many international programs, often take longer, sometimes beyond five years. Over 50% of the Company PUDs booked prior to 2002 are in Algeria and are being developed according to an Algerian government approved plan. The remaining PUDs booked prior to 2002 are primarily associated with Alaska and ongoing programs in the onshore United States for improved recovery.

The Company history of production growth relative to proved reserve growth is shown below. This data demonstrates the Company ability to convert proved reserves to production in a timely manner. The decrease in proved reserves in 2004 and production in 2005 is primarily related to properties sold in 2004. Reserves Converted to Production Proved Reserves (MMBOE) Produced (MBOE/d) 1995 526 109 1996 601 104 1997 708 120 1998 935 129 1999 991 135 2000 2,061 306 2001 2,305 546 2002 2,328 539 2003 2,513 525 2004 2,367 520 2005 2,449 434 CAGR 17 15 37 Table of Contents Future Net Cash Flows At December 31, 2005, the present value (discounted at 10%) of future net cash flows from Anadarko proved reserves was $29.3 billion (stated in accordance with the regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This present value was calculated based on prices at year-end held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. The increase of $10.6 billion or 57% in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to higher natural gas and oil prices at year-end 2005 and successful exploration and development drilling in North America. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarko proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. Marketing Strategies Overview The Company marketing department manages sales of its natural gas, crude oil and NGLs. In marketing its production, the Company attempts to maximize realized prices while managing credit exposure. The Company sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale. The Company also purchases natural gas, crude oil and NGLs volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near Anadarko production. These purchases allow the Company to aggregate larger volumes, attract larger, more creditworthy customers and facilitate its efforts to maximize prices received for the Company production. The Company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of gas, oil, condensate and NGLs. However, the Company does not engage in market-making practices nor does it trade in any non-energy-related commodities. The Company trading risk position, typically, is a net short position that is offset by the Company natural long position as a producer. See Energy Price Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10-K. Since 2002, all segments of the energy market have experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition, liquidity and credit. This has been reflected in rating agency credit downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies. Anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third-party purchasers; however, in certain situations the Company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases. Natural Gas Natural gas continues to supply a significant portion of North America energy needs and the Company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue. The tightening of the natural gas supply and demand fundamentals has resulted in extremely volatile natural gas prices, which is expected to continue. Anadarko markets its equity natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets. Anadarko Energy Services Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, is a marketing company offering supply assurance, competitive pricing, risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs. The Company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. The Company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility. Included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative instruments. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 7%, 12% and 35%, respectively, of the Company gas production was sold under long-term contracts to Duke Energy Corporation (Duke). These sales represent 4%, 6% and 22% of total revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The contracts that represented most of the 2004 and 2003 volumes expired during 2004. The Company integrated the marketing of the natural gas previously sold to Duke into its current marketing operations and now sells it to various purchasers at market prices. Volumes sold to Duke under the long-term contracts were at market prices. A company Anadarko acquired in 2000 was a party to several long-term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within its gathering, processing and marketing business segment, which was sold in 1999 to Duke. Most of these agreements were transferred to Duke in the disposition. One agreement 38 Table of Contents was retained, but is managed and operated by Duke. Anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the Company natural gas. As part of the disposition, Anadarko pays Duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates, while Duke pays Anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates (keep-whole agreement). The term of the keep-whole agreement extends through February 2009. The Company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to potential decreases in future transportation market values. While derivatives are intended to reduce the Company exposure to declines in the market value of firm transportation, they also limit the potential to benefit from increases in the market value of firm transportation. In January 2006, Anadarko and Duke entered into an agreement to terminate the keep-whole agreement prospectively, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent. The agreement also provides that Duke will transfer to Anadarko a portfolio of certain gas transportation agreements subject to the keep-whole agreement on several U.S. and Canadian pipelines, effective April 1, 2006. The Company believes the agreement will not have a material effect on its future consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Crude Oil, Condensate and NGLs Anadarko crude oil, condensate and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Canada, Algeria and other international areas. Most of the Company U.S. crude oil and NGLs production is sold under 30-day evergreen contracts with prices based on market indices and adjusted for location, quality and transportation. Most of the Company Canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater. Oil from Algeria and other international areas is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products like jet and diesel fuel. The Company also purchases and sells third-party produced crude oil, condensate and NGLs in the Company domestic and international market areas. Included in this strategy is the use of leased NGLs storage facilities and various derivative instruments. Gas Gathering Systems and Processing Anadarko investment in gas gathering operations allows the Company to better manage its gas production, improve ultimate recovery of reserves, enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities. The Company has invested about $206 million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last 5 years. The vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from Anadarko-operated wells. The Company processes gas at various third-party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction of NGLs in efficient plants with flexible commitments. Anadarko also processes gas and has interests in two Company-operated plants. Anadarko strategy to aggregate gas through Company-owned and third-party gathering systems allows Anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the Company has significant production. Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview Anadarko primary source of cash during 2005 was cash flow from operating activities. The Company used cash flow primarily to fund its capital spending program, repurchase Anadarko common stock and pay dividends. In addition, the Company used $170 million of cash from the 2004 divestitures to retire debt in 2005. The Company funded its capital investment programs in 2004 and 2003 primarily through cash flow from operating activities. In 2004, the Company completed over $3 billion in various pretax asset sales. The Company used proceeds from these asset sales to reduce debt, repurchase Anadarko common stock and otherwise to have funds available for reinvestment in other strategic options. Cash Flow from Operating Activities Anadarko cash flow from operating activities in 2005 was $4.1 billion compared to $3.2 billion in 2004 and $3.0 billion in 2003. The increase in 2005 cash flow, attributed to higher net realized commodity prices, was partially offset by lower sales volumes resulting from the 2004 divestitures. The increase in 2004 cash flow compared to 2003 was attributed to the significant increase in commodity prices, partially offset by higher costs and expenses. Fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Company short-term changes in cash flow from operating activities. Anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk. Sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short-term, but have not been as volatile as commodity 39 Table of Contents prices in prior years. Anadarko long-term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations. Capital Expenditures The following table shows the Company capital expenditures by category. 2005 2004 2003 millions Development $ 2,278 $ 2,348 $ 1,846 Exploration 722 513 713 Property acquisitions Development proved 45 3 203 Exploration unproved 269 155 124 Total oil and gas costs incurred* 3,314 3,019 2,886 Less: Asset retirement costs (37 ) (52 ) (187 ) Plus: Asset retirement expenditures 29 26 20 Total oil and gas capital expenditures* 3,306 2,993 2,719 Gathering and other 131 97 73 Total $ 3,437 $ 3,090 $ 2,792 * Oil and gas costs incurred represent capitalized costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent actual cash outlays excluding corporate acquisitions. Anadarko capital spending increased 11% in 2005 and 2004 compared to the previous periods. The increase in 2005 includes higher exploration costs in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, both periods were impacted by rising service and material costs. The variances in the mix of oil and gas spending reflect the Company available opportunities based on the near-term ranking of projects by net asset value potential. The acquisitions in 2005 and 2004 primarily relate to exploratory nonproducing leases. The acquisitions in 2003 primarily relate to the acquisition of producing properties and exploratory nonproducing leases. Anadarko participated in a total of 836 gross wells in 2005 compared to 1,069 gross wells in 2004 and 1,069 gross wells in 2003. The following table provides additional detail of the Company drilling activity in 2005 and 2004.

Net: working interest ownership. The Company 2005 exploration and development drilling program is discussed in Oil and Gas Properties and Activities under Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 40 Table of Contents Common Stock Repurchase Program During 2005, a $2 billion stock buyback program announced in 2004 was completed and an additional $1 billion stock buyback program was authorized in November. Shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During 2005 and 2004, Anadarko purchased 10.8 million and 20.3 million shares of common stock for $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, under these programs. The Company expects to purchase additional shares under the current program as anticipated excess cash flow is realized; however, the repurchase program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. At December 31, 2005, $754 million remained available for stock repurchases under the program authorized in 2005. Debt At year-end 2005, Anadarko total debt was $3.7 billion compared to total debt of $3.8 billion at year-end 2004 and $5.1 billion at year-end 2003. During 2005 and 2004, Anadarko repurchased $0.2 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, aggregate principal amounts of its outstanding debt. The Company used net proceeds from asset divestitures to fund the debt reductions. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity and interest rates, see Note 6 Debt and Interest Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Dividends In 2005, Anadarko paid $170 million in dividends to its common stockholders (18 cents per share per quarter). In 2004, Anadarko paid $139 million in dividends to its common stockholders (14 cents per share per quarter). In 2003, Anadarko paid $109 million in dividends to its common stockholders (10 cents per share in the first, second and third quarters and 14 cents per share in the fourth quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in 1986. The amount of future dividends for Anadarko common stock will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The covenants in the Company credit agreement provide for a maximum capitalization ratio of 60% debt, exclusive of the effect of any noncash writedowns. As of December 31, 2005, Anadarko capitalization ratio was 25% debt; therefore, retained earnings were not restricted as to the payment of dividends. In each of the years 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company also paid $5 million in preferred stock dividends. In 2006 preferred stock dividends are expected to be $5 million. Outlook The Company goals include continuing to find high-margin oil and gas reserves at competitive prices and keeping operating costs at efficient levels. The Company 2006 capital expenditure budget is expected to be approximately $4 billion. The Company has allocated about 70% of the budget to development activities, 20% to exploration activities and the remaining 10% for capitalized interest, overhead and other items. A significant portion of capital spending in 2006 is expected to focus on unconventional tight gas plays onshore North America, primarily in north Louisiana, west Texas, east Texas and Alberta, Canada. In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, facilities will be installed to link several Anadarko-operated natural gas discoveries with the Independence Hub. In the central Gulf of Mexico, the Company expects to bring several high-volume wells on-line at the Marco Polo hub facility and participate in exploration or delineation wells in the foldbelt area. Outside North America, the international program includes continued development of Block 208 discoveries in Algeria and exploration activity in Algeria, Qatar, Indonesia, Tunisia and West Africa, as well as activities within other potential new venture areas. Anadarko strategy with respect to its capital program is to maintain a steady level of activity despite the volatile nature of commodity prices. This is accomplished by setting capital activity at levels that are self-funding. When prices exceed targeted levels, as is currently the case, costs tend to increase as well. The cash generated in excess of the amount needed to fund the steady level of capital activity is: systematically returned to shareholders through stock repurchases; used to build additional balance sheet strength through debt reductions; or otherwise made available for reinvestment in other strategic options. Alternatively, when prices are below the Company targeted levels, Anadarko could draw upon its strengthened debt capacity to fund a steady level of activity. The Company 2006 capital spending noted above was determined at an investment level that is less than cash flow using estimated full year 2006 NYMEX prices; therefore, cash flow in 2006 is expected to be higher than capital spending. If capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow, funds are supplemented as needed by short-term borrowings under commercial paper, money market loans or credit agreement borrowings. To facilitate such borrowings, the Company has in place a $750 million committed credit agreement, which is supplemented by 41 Table of Contents various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then-quoted rates. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility. It is the Company policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back-stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities. The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short-term borrowings by issuing long-term debt in the public or private debt markets. To facilitate such financings, the Company may file shelf registration statements in advance with the SEC. The Company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including property sales and additional borrowings, to secure funds when needed. In February 2006, the Company Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one split of the common stock. The stock split will require that shareholders authorize the issuance of additional shares for this purpose at the Company May 11, 2006 annual meeting. If approved, Anadarko transfer agent will deliver to each holder of record at the close of business on May 12, 2006, one additional share for every share of common stock held on May 26, 2006. Anadarko common stock should begin trading on a post-split basis on May 29, 2006. Based on year-end 2005 shares outstanding, Anadarko would have approximately 460 million shares of common stock outstanding following the proposed stock split. At this time, Anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, the Executives and Directors Benefits Trust, the exercise of stock options, the issuance of restricted stock, performance unit agreements or the Company proposed stock split. Obligations and Commitments Following is a summary of the Company future payments on obligations as of December 31, 2005: Obligations by Period 2-3 4-5 Later 1 Year Years Years Years Total millions Total debt $ 123 $ 547 $ 52 $ 3,074 $ 3,796 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 296 1,163 539 1,998 Other 69 133 79 48 329 Marketing activities 78 134 86 153 451 Oil and gas activities 184 108 73 365 Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include $2 billion related to drilling rig commitments that qualify as operating leases. During 2005, Anadarko entered into various agreements to secure the necessary drilling rigs to execute its drilling strategy over the next several years. A review of the Company worldwide deepwater drilling inventory, along with the tightening deepwater and onshore rig market, led Anadarko to secure the drilling rigs it needs to execute its strategy. Nearly two-thirds of the proposed contracted rig time is intended to delineate and develop discoveries, with the remainder for high potential exploration. The Company believes these rig-contracting efforts offer compelling economics and facilitate its drilling strategy. In addition to addressing the cost side of the equation, the Company also hedged a portion of its forecasted crude oil sales for the time period covered by the rig commitments to help manage the risk of potential declines in market-based rig rates. The Company also has $329 million in commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements for a production platform and equipment, buildings, facilities and aircraft. During 2004, Anadarko and a group of energy companies (Atwater Valley Producers Group) executed agreements with a third party to design, construct, install and own Independence Hub, a semi-submersible platform in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The platform structure, expected to be mechanically complete in late 2006, will be operated by Anadarko. First production from Anadarko discoveries to be processed on the facility is expected in the second half of 2007. The agreements require a monthly demand charge of about $2 million for five years beginning at the time of mechanical completion, a processing fee based upon production throughput and a transportation fee based upon pipeline throughput. Since the Company obligation related to the agreements begins at the time of mechanical completion, the table above does not include any amounts related to these agreements. The agreements do not contain any purchase options, purchase obligations or value guarantees. For additional information see Note 19 Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 42 Table of Contents Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various transportation and storage agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas. The above table includes transportation and storage commitments of $451 million, comprised of $370 million in the United States and $81 million in Canada. LNG Facility Natural Gas Delivery Commitments In 2005, the Company entered into precedent agreements with a third party in order to secure delivery of natural gas from a LNG facility Anadarko is constructing in Nova Scotia, Canada, called Bear Head, to prospective markets in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. The third party has agreed to expand the capacity of its pipeline so it can accommodate the projected natural gas volumes from Bear Head. The precedent agreements signed by the parties establish the conditions on which the third party will proceed with design, regulatory approvals and construction of the expansion facilities, and be obligated to transport a specified volume of gas. As a condition to entering into the precedent agreements, Anadarko executed firm service agreements for transportation on the Canadian and United States portions of the pipeline. Upon satisfaction of the obligations under the precedent agreements, the initial term of the transportation agreements is 20 years. Based upon the terms, Anadarko projects that annual demand charges due under the firm transportation service agreements may be in the range of $123 million to $182 million per year for the first five years from commencement of full service, potentially escalating by up to 5% in year six and 10% in year seven, exclusive of fuel and surcharges. No later than the eighth year from commencement of full service, rates under the agreements are to be redetermined based on then current conditions. The precedent agreements contain certain termination rights. The Company potential reimbursement obligation under the precedent agreements increases over time as the third party incurs pre-service costs. According to the original schedule provided by the third party, this reimbursement obligation is expected to increase from about $8 million at December 31, 2005 to $100 million at December 31, 2006, up to a maximum of $215 million in May 2007. Due to the number of factors that need to materialize in order to reasonably project the cumulative obligation and the existence of termination rights, the table above does not include any amounts related to these agreements. Oil and Gas Activities As is common in the oil and gas industry, Anadarko has various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities, which extend beyond the 2006 budget. The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $365 million, comprised of $198 million in the United States, $45 million in Canada, $15 million in Algeria and $107 million in other international locations. The Company also routinely enters into short-term commitments, which are included in the Company 2006 capital budget of $4 billion; therefore, these commitments are not included in the preceding table. Marketing and Trading Contracts The following tables provide additional information as of December 31, 2005 regarding the Company marketing and trading portfolio of physical delivery and financially settled derivative instruments and the firm transportation keep-whole agreement and related financial derivative instruments. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives is calculated. Firm Marketing Transportation and Trading Keep-whole Total millions Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2004 assets (liabilities) $ 16 $ (54 ) $ (38 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during 2005 1 6 7 Fair value of new contracts when entered into during 2005 Other changes in fair value (12 ) 56 44 Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2005 assets (liabilities) $ 5 $ 8 $ 13 43 Table of Contents Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2005 Maturity Maturity less than Maturity Maturity in excess Assets (Liabilities) 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years of 5 Years Total millions Marketing and Trading Prices actively quoted $ $ 3 $ 1 $ 1 $ 5 Prices based on models and other valuation methods Firm Transportation Keep-whole Prices actively quoted $ 30 $ $ $ $ 30 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (22 ) (22 ) Total Prices actively quoted $ 30 $ 3 $ 1 $ 1 $ 35 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (22 ) (22 ) Both exchange and over-the -counter traded derivative instruments are subject to margin deposit requirements. Margin deposits are required of the Company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits. Given the Company hedge position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements. During 2005, the Company margin deposit requirements have ranged from zero to $10 million. The Company had margin deposits of $9 million outstanding at December 31, 2005. Other In 2005, the Company made contributions of $116 million to its funded pension plans, $5 million to its unfunded pension plans and $7 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Contributions to the funded plans increase the plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used for current benefit payments. In 2006, the Company expects to contribute about $61 million to its funded pension plans, $10 million to its unfunded pension plans and $7 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Future contributions to funded pension plans will be affected by actuarial assumptions, market performance and individual year funding decisions. The Company is unable to accurately predict what contribution levels will be required beyond 2006 for the pension plans; however, they are expected to be at levels lower than those made in 2005. The Company expects future payments for other postretirement benefit plans to continue at slightly increasing levels above those made in 2005. During 2004, proceeds from the sale of future royalty revenues were accounted for as deferred revenues and classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. These deferred revenues will be amortized to other sales on a unit-of -revenue basis over the 11-year term of the related agreement. The third party relies solely on the royalty payments to recover their investment and, as such, has the risk of the royalties not being sufficient to recover their investment over the term of the agreement. Anadarko is also subject to various environmental remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2005, the Company balance sheet included a $46 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which were incurred by companies that Anadarko has acquired. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on contracts, obligations and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 6 Debt and Interest Expense, Note 7 Financial Instruments, Note 8 Sale of Future Hard Minerals Royalty Revenues, Note 9 Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 20 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans and Note 21 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 44 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Financial Statements and Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, Management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Management reviews its estimates, including those related to litigation, environmental liabilities, income taxes, fair values and determination of proved reserves. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these policies and estimates with the Company Audit Committee. Proved Reserves Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) (2i), (2ii), (2iii), (3) and (4), are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Company engineers, are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the DD&A rate calculation and the financial statements. Under the terms of Anadarko risk service contract with the national oil company of Venezuela, Anadarko earns a fee that is translated into barrels of oil based on current prices (economic interest method). This means that higher oil prices reduce the Company reported production volumes and reserves from that project and lower oil prices increase reported production volumes and reserves. Production volume and reserve changes due to the prices used to determine the Company economic interest have no impact on the value of the project. Properties and Equipment The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the SEC. Under this method of accounting, the costs of unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. The application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Costs Excluded Properties and equipment include costs that are excluded from costs being depreciated or amortized. Oil and gas costs excluded represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which the Company owns a direct interest. These unproved property costs include nonproducing leasehold, geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs. Anadarko excludes these costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate for that country. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. Costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties. 45 Table of Contents Significant properties, primarily comprised of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks, Alaska, the Land Grant and other international areas, are individually evaluated each quarter by the Company exploration and engineering staff. Nonproducing leases and geological and geophysical costs are transferred to the DD&A pool based on the progress of the Company exploration program. Exploration drilling costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties, which is generally based on drilling results. The Company has a 10- to 12-year exploration and evaluation program for the Land Grant acreage. Costs are transferred to the DD&A pool as they are evaluated. The Land Grant mineral interests (both working and royalty interests) are owned by the Company in perpetuity. Insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the United States and Canada. Nonproducing leases, along with related geological and geophysical costs, are transferred to the DD&A pool over a three- to five-year period based on the lease term. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties. Other costs excluded from depreciation represent major construction projects that are in progress. Derivative Instruments Current accounting rules require that all derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchase and sale exception, be recorded at fair value. Quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value. If quotations are not available, management best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or on valuation techniques. The Company derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over-the -counter market. The fair values of the derivative instruments are based on quoted market prices, option pricing models and other internally developed valuation models. Option fair values are based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model and verified against the applicable counterparty fair values. The fair value of the short-term portion of the firm transportation keep-whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis differentials. Basis differentials are the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the NYMEX gas futures contract price. Management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to a lack of liquidity. Accordingly, the fair value of the long-term portion is estimated based on an internally developed model that utilizes historical natural gas basis differentials. Derivative accounting rules require that fair value changes of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be reported in current period earnings, rather than in the period the derivatives are settled and/or the hedged transaction is settled. This can result in significant volatility in earnings. The Company prefers to utilize hedge accounting for those derivative instruments that are used to manage price risk associated with its forecasted oil and gas production, foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rates. However, some of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Derivative accounting rules are complex and subject to interpretation in their application. Interpretative guidance continues to evolve and, as a result, it is possible the Company accounting policy for derivative instruments could be modified in the future. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of various taxing jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for all significant temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential tax contingencies and, if required, establishes accruals for such contingencies. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by Company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although Company management believes its tax accruals are adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters. 46 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Developments New Accounting Principles SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, requires the recognition of expense for the fair value of share-based payments. The statement is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2006. The Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for share-based payments effective January 1, 2003, using the modified prospective method described in SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees. Anadarko expects to continue to use this acceptable option pricing model upon the required adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will have a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position. Certain amounts attributable to the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation in the financial statements that have been previously reported in the statement of cash flow as operating activities other items net will be reported as financing activities since they relate to the issuance of common stock. These amounts were $53 million, $36 million and $1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other Developments Anadarko operations in Venezuela have been governed by an Operating Service Agreement (OSA) that was entered into in November 1993 between the Company and an affiliate of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the national oil company of Venezuela. Anadarko and its partner in the OSA, Petrobras Energia Venezuela (Petrobras), have conducted their OSA operations via a Venezuelan joint venture in which Petrobras acts as operator. In 2005, the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy and Petroleum announced that all OSAs concluded by PDVSA between 1992 and 1997 will be subject to renegotiation. The Company and Petrobras signed a Transitory Agreement with PDVSA in September 2005. Under this agreement, the parties are currently negotiating the conversion of the OSA to a company in which Anadarko, Petrobras and PDVSA will each have an interest. PDVSA is expected to have a majority participation interest in this company. The Company cannot predict at this time the outcome of these negotiations. Related to these developments, PDVSA has limited the fees paid to the Company by applying a cap to the revenues with respect to the oil production from the OSA. The Company revenues for 2005 were reduced by $48 million to reflect the cumulative estimated impact of the reduced fees through December 2005. The Company recorded revenues from Venezuela of $193 million in 2005. In January 2006, the Company paid approximately $6 million of Venezuela tax related to an assessment by SENIAT, the Venezuela national tax authority, which included an increase in corporate income tax rates (67.7% for 2001 and 50% for 2002-2004). For the year ended December 31, 2005, approximately 2% of the Company income before income taxes, total assets and proved reserves were associated with operations located in Venezuela. The Company is unable to determine the impact of the current situation in Venezuela on future operating results or proved reserves. 47 Table of Contents
