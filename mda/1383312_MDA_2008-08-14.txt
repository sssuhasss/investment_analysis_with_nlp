SEPARATION OF BROADRIDGE FROM ADP The spin-off of Broadridge by ADP became effective on March 30, 2007 through a distribution of 100% of the common stock of the Company to the holders of record of ADP common stock (the Distribution ). The Distribution was effected pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement by which ADP contributed to the Company the subsidiaries that operated its brokerage services business. ADP distributed all of the shares of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. as a dividend on ADP common stock on March 30, 2007 to all stockholders of record as of March 23, 2007. In connection with the spin-off, we made a cash payment to ADP on March 30, 2007 of $690.0 million which was financed through borrowings under $1,190.0 million of credit facilities that were entered into on March 29, 2007. The payment is reflected as a dividend to ADP in Stockholders Equity. A significant portion of the expenses to effect the separation were incurred by ADP, such as investment banking fees, related outside legal and accounting fees, office move costs, costs to separate information systems, and temporary consulting costs. Broadridge incurred separation costs that have a future benefit to the Company, including stock compensation expense relating to the Distribution and other items such as relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to the Company, and the temporary labor costs incurred to develop ongoing processes for operating on a stand-alone basis. FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS Historical ADP Cost Allocations Compared to Broadridge as a Stand-alone Entity Our historical Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These Financial Statements present the consolidated and combined financial position and results of operations of the former brokerage services business of ADP. The Combined Financial Statements for periods before the Distribution include allocated costs for facilities, functions and services used by the brokerage services business at shared ADP sites and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized ADP organizations and directly charged to the brokerage services business based on usage. Our management believes these allocation methods are reasonable. As an independent public company, we are responsible for these services and bear all of these expenses directly. The historical allocation of ADP expenses to us may be significantly less than the actual costs we will incur as an independent company. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 and for the period from the date of the Distribution to June 30, 2007, the Company incurred approximately $26.6 million and $8.0 million, respectively, in public company related expenses. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations were recorded on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by the Company were included in the Company Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings since their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. The Company acquired one business in the Securities Processing Solutions segment in fiscal year 2008 for $6.1 million. This acquisition resulted in approximately $3.6 million of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired, 33 Table of Contents which totaled approximately $2.5 million, consist of acquired technology that is being amortized over a five-year life. This acquisition was not material to the Company operations, financial position, or cash flows. The Company acquired one business in the Investor Communication Solutions segment in fiscal year 2006 for $3.0 million. This acquisition resulted in approximately $0.9 million of goodwill. This acquisition was not material to the Company operations, financial position, or cash flows. In fiscal year 2006, a purchase price adjustment of $15.4 million was received from the seller based on the resolution of certain provisions of the purchase agreement for the fiscal year 2005 acquisition of the U.S. Clearing and Dealer Services divisions of Bank of America Corporation, the business that became our subsidiary Ridge Clearing. BORROWINGS On March 29, 2007, the Company entered into a $1,190.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, consisting of a $440.0 million five-year term loan facility, a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. On March 29, 2007, the Company borrowed $440.0 million under the five-year term loan facility and $250.0 million under the one-year revolving credit facility. The proceeds received in connection with the $690.0 million of borrowings were paid to ADP on March 30, 2007 as a dividend. These credit facilities are subject to covenants, including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At June 30, 2008 and 2007, the Company was not aware of any instances of non-compliance with the financial covenants of this credit facility. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, the Company repaid $170.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively, of the five-year term loan facility. The one-year revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on May 29, 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and cash. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Broadridge. Please refer to Note 11 Borrowings to our Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These Financial Statements present the consolidated position of the Company as a separate, stand- alone entity subsequent to the Distribution, presented along with the historical operations of the brokerage services business on a combined basis which were operated as part of ADP before the Distribution. These Financial Statements include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts included in Retained earnings reflect the Company Net earnings subsequent to the Distribution. The Company combined results of operations, and cash flows for periods before the Distribution, may not be indicative of its future performance and do not necessarily reflect what its results of operations and cash flows would have been had the Company operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented, including changes in its operations and capitalization as a result of the separation from ADP. In particular, interest expense and corporate overhead costs are higher in the periods after the Distribution than they were before the Distribution. In addition, the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings for the period before the Distribution include a trademark royalty fee charged by ADP to the Company based on revenues for licensing fees associated with the use of the ADP trademark. After the Distribution, such royalties are no longer charged to the Company. In presenting the Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. In management opinion, the Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. 34 Table of Contents The Financial Statements for periods before the Distribution include costs for facilities, functions and services used by the Company at shared ADP sites, and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized ADP organizations and directly charged to the Company based on usage. The expenses allocated to the Company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if the Company had been a separate, independent entity and had otherwise managed these functions. Following the separation from ADP, the Company performs these functions using internal resources or purchased services, certain of which were provided by ADP during a transitional period pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. See Note 17, Transactions With Former Parent to the Financial Statements for a detailed description of the Company transactions with ADP subsequent to the Distribution. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Financial Statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Goodwill . We review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, ( FASB ) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. When determining fair value, we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We had $484.3 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2008. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill. Income Taxes . We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2008, we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $27.9 million of which $4.7 million expires in years 2009 through 2014, and $ 23.2 million which has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, we have estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of a U.S. subsidiary which is not included in our consolidated tax return of approximately $27.6 million as of June 30, 2008 and will expire in 2023 through 2028. We have recorded valuation allowances of $29.8 million and $21.9 million at June 30, 2008 35 Table of Contents and 2007, respectively, because we do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating and capital loss carryforwards, and foreign tax credits of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. Share-based Payments . SFAS No. 123R , Share-Based Payment, requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. Before July 1, 2005, ADP, our former parent company, followed Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ( APB No. 25 ), and related interpretations. Under APB No. 25, stock-based compensation expense was not recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan, as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and with respect to the employee stock purchase plan, the discount did not exceed fifteen percent. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2008 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.7 million change in total pretax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2008 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2008 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.0 million change in the total pretax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2008 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2008 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pretax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2008 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2008 stock option grants would result in approximately a $(0.8) million change in the total pretax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2008 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of Analysis of Consolidated and Combined Operations and Analysis of Reportable Segments refers to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The Analysis of Consolidated and Combined Operations should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated and Combined Results of Operations. 36 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED OPERATIONS Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The table below presents Consolidated and Combined Statement of Earnings data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Years Ended June 30, 2008 2007 Change ($) (%) ($ in millions, except for per share amounts) Net revenues $ 2,207.5 $ 2,137.9 $ 69.6 3.3 Cost of net revenues 1,606.4 1,588.1 18.3 1.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 244.3 216.7 27.6 12.7 Other expenses, net 30.9 12.3 18.6 151.2 Total expenses 1,881.6 1,817.1 64.5 3.5 Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 325.9 320.8 5.1 1.6 Margin 14.8 % 15.0 % (0.2 ) pts Provision for income taxes 133.7 123.7 10.0 8.1 Effective tax rate 41.0 % 38.6 % 2.4 pts Net earnings from continuing operations $ 192.2 $ 197.1 $ (4.9 ) (2.5 ) Basic EPS from continuing operations $ 1.38 $ 1.42 $ (0.04 ) (2.8 ) Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 1.36 $ 1.42 $ (0.06 ) (4.2 ) Total Net Revenues .

The increase reflects favorable foreign currency exchange rates and growth in our business segments driven by both internal and new business growth. The total increase in Net revenues was partially offset by the two previously announced client losses that impacted gains in all three of our business segments. Investor Communication Solutions segment Net revenues increased $21.0 million, or 1.4%. The increase was driven by higher internal growth resulting from gains in processing fees and higher sales, partially offset by lower distribution fees and the loss of the previously announced large client. Distribution revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 were $807.8 million, a decrease of $13.1 million, or (1.6%), compared to $820.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, driven primarily by the impact of our new notice and access proxy solution, higher suppressions and the previously announced loss of a large client; partially offset by higher rates generated by the U.S. Postal Services postage rate change. Securities Processing Solutions segment Net revenues increased by $4.5 million, or 0.9%. The increase reflects higher internal growth driven by higher trade volume from existing clients during the first six months ended December 31, 2007 and new business. The increase in Net revenues was partially offset by the previously announced loss of a large client. Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment Net revenues increased by $2.0 million, or 2.1%, driven by new business and internal growth from existing clients, partially offset by the previously announced loss of a large client. Total Net revenues were also favorably impacted by $26.6 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and a $15.5 million increase in Other segment Net revenues. The increase in Other segment Net 37 Table of Contents revenues reflects $8.0 million related to the change in methodology for charging the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment for services provided by the Company other segments, $6.7 million in one-time non-recurring termination fees, and the elimination of intercompany Interest expense from securities operations. Total Expenses . Total expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 were $1,881.6 million, an increase of $64.5 million, or 3.5%, compared to $1,817.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

Cost of net revenues in our Investor Communication Solutions segment decreased by $7.6 million, or 0.6%, driven by a decrease in distribution costs attributable to the impact of our new notice and access proxy solution, higher suppressions, and the loss of the previously announced large client; partially offset by higher rates generated by the U.S. Postal Services postage rate change. Distribution Cost of net revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 were $711.7 million, a decrease of $20.1 million, or (2.7)%, compared to $731.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

Cost of net revenues in our Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment decreased $3.0 million, or 3.7%, reflecting the change in methodology for charging of services provided by the Company other segments. Other segment Cost of net revenues increased $7.0 million, reflecting $8.0 million related to the change in methodology for charging the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment for services provided by the Company other segments, partially offset by non-recurring charges in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also increased total Cost of net revenues by $12.6 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 were $244.3 million, an increase of $27.6 million, or 12.7%, compared to $216.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increase primarily reflects $26.6 million in incremental public company expenses, $7.5 million of selling expenses driven by higher closed sales, and $13.4 million in stock compensation expense, of which $7.2 million represents the expense related to the special stock option grants to corporate officers. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by the elimination of royalty fees of $27.3 million which are no longer paid to ADP. Other expenses, net increased $18.6 million, reflecting $20.7 million related to interest expense on borrowings, partially offset by $1.9 million in lower interest expense on notes payable to ADP affiliated parties.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2008 was 41.0%, compared to 38.6% for fiscal year 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a one-time adjustment related to our spin-off from ADP. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations . Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 were $192.2 million, a decrease of $4.9 million, or 2.5%, compared to $197.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The lower Net earnings from 38 Table of Contents continuing operations reflects increased Net revenues, offset by increased expenses, and a higher effective tax rate, as described above. Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 2.8% and 4.2%, to $1.38 and $1.36, respectively for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The table below presents consolidated and combined statement of operations data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Years Ended June 30, 2007 2006 Change ($) (%) ($ in millions, except for per share amounts) Net revenues $ 2,137.9 $ 1,933.3 $ 204.6 10.6 Cost of net revenues 1,588.1 1,433.0 155.1 10.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 216.7 195.9 20.8 10.6 Other expenses, net 12.3 1.7 10.6 NM * Total expenses 1,817.1 1,630.6 186.5 11.4 Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 320.8 302.7 18.1 6.0 Margin 15.0 % 15.7 % (0.7 )pts Provision for income taxes 123.7 122.2 1.5 1.2 Effective tax rate 38.6 % 40.4 % (1.8 )pts Net earnings from continuing operations $ 197.1 $ 180.5 $ 16.6 9.2 Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.42 $ 1.30 $ 0.12 9.2 * Not Meaningful Total Net Revenues .

Excluding one-time transition costs of $14.0 million, fiscal year 2007 margin was equal to fiscal year 2006. Provision for Income Taxes . Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was 38.6%, compared to 40.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to a favorable mix of income among tax jurisdictions, a lower effective U.S. state income tax rate, and the impact of a decrease in the amount of operating losses for which there was no tax benefit for fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations . Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 were $197.1 million, an increase of $16.6 million, or 9.2%, compared to $180.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The higher Net earnings from continuing operations reflects increased Net revenues, partially offset by increased Total expenses, and a lower effective tax rate, as described above. Basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 9.2%, to $1.42 for fiscal year 2007. ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Investor Communication Solutions, Securities Processing Solutions, and Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions are the Company reportable segments. The primary components of Other are the elimination of inter-segment revenues and profits and certain unallocated expenses. Foreign exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and fiscal year 2008 budgeted foreign exchange rates. The prior fiscal years reportable segment Net revenues have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal year 2008 budgeted foreign exchange rates. This adjustment represents a reconciling difference to Net revenues and Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items of an unusual or non-recurring nature in consolidation rather than reflect such items in segment profit. The Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment is charged for services provided by other segments and it records these costs as operating expenses. Before January 2007, the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment 40 Table of Contents was billed for these services on a mark-up basis with the other segments recording revenue for the amount of these billings. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, and 2006, the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment was billed $2.0 million, and $4.5 million, respectively, for services provided by the Investor Communication Solutions segment and $6.0 million and $12.4 million, respectively, for services provided by the Securities Processing Solutions segment. Beginning in January 2007, the Company changed its methodology for charging the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment for services provided by the Company other segments. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 and from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007, the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment was charged $3.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively, from the Investor Communication Solutions segment and $4.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, from the Securities Processing Solutions segment based on the cost of providing such services. The other segments record these services as cost transfers in Cost of net revenues.

Of the 1.4%, increase in net fee revenues contributed 2.2 percentage points and was partially offset by a decrease in net distribution revenues of (0.8) percentage points. The increase in net fee revenues was driven by internal growth of 2.7% resulting from gains in processing fees due to the impact of our 41 Table of Contents new notice and access proxy solution, higher suppressions, and higher activity in interim communication services, and transaction reporting and fulfillment. Net revenues from new sales increased by 0.9%, driven by transaction reporting and fulfillment; offset by the previously announced loss of a large client (anniversary date of loss was the third quarter of fiscal year 2008), resulting in (0.5)% reduction in net new business. Net distribution revenues were $807.8 million, a decrease of $13.1 million, or (1.6)%, driven primarily by the impact of our new notice and access proxy solution, higher suppressions, and the previously announced loss of a large client; partially offset by higher rates generated by the U.S. Postal Services postage rate change. Position growth, which is a measure of how many holders own a security compared to the prior fiscal year and a key factor in the number of pieces processed, was a positive 1.8% for annual equity proxies and a positive 9.3% for mutual fund interims.

The 11.0% Net revenue increase was primarily driven by internal growth including event-driven activity. Fiscal year 2007 Net revenues from our proxy and interim communications services grew primarily due to higher event-driven activity related to equity mergers/contest and mutual fund proxies and interim communications. Our fulfillment services and transaction reporting services revenues increased due to higher volumes processed from our existing client base and acquisitions. Other communication services growth is attributable to event-driven activity related to corporate actions distributions driven by internal growth. Net distribution revenues were $820.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, an increase of 12.4%, compared to $730.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. The increase in distribution Net revenues was driven by higher volumes and to a lesser extent, higher rates due to an increase in the U.S. Postal Services postage rates. Our number of pieces processed increased 11.4% from 1,047.0 million pieces for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 to 1,166.8 million pieces for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2008 and 2007, Cash and cash equivalents were $198.3 million and $88.6 million, respectively. Stockholders Equity was $745.8 million and $531.1 million at June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At June 30, 2008, working capital was $553.8 million compared to $531.4 million at June 30, 2007. On March 29, 2007, the Company entered into a $1,190.0 million credit facility, consisting of a $440.0 million five-year term loan, a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. On March 29, 2007, the Company drew down fully on the $440.0 million five-year term loan facility and the $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. The proceeds received in connection with the $690.0 million of borrowings were paid to ADP on March 30, 2007 as a dividend. During the fiscal years 2008 and 2007, the Company repaid $170.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively, of the five-year term loan facility. The one-year revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on May 29, 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and cash. The terms of the Senior Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of May 29, 2007, by and between Broadridge and U.S. Bank National Association. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Broadridge. Interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6.125%. Based upon current and anticipated levels of operation, we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations, combined with borrowings available under the credit facility, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our current and anticipated cash operating requirements, capital expenditures, and working capital needs. Please 45 Table of Contents refer to Note 12, Regulatory Requirements to our Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the discussion of cash flows used in financing activities in the following section for further discussion of our financing activities. Cash Flows The cash flows from operating and financing activities for our Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment differ from that of our other businesses. Broker-dealer and customer margin activities and transactions require the Company to obtain financing from both internal and external sources. Additionally, regulations associated with the broker-dealer industry require cash or securities to be segregated for the exclusive benefit of customers in certain circumstances based on regulatory calculations driven by customers balances. As a result, management analyzes cash flows provided from operating and financing activities of the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment separately from all other businesses. Within operating activities, increases in Securities clearing receivables and Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes and securities deposited with clearing organizations are a use of cash, this can be funded by an increase in Securities clearing payables (reflected within operating activities) or Short-term borrowings (reflected within financing activities). As a result, management analyzes cash flows provided from securities clearing activities separately from all other businesses. Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities were as follows: Years Ended June 30, 2008 2007 Change ($) (%) (in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities, excluding the securities clearing activities $ 336.0 $ 289.2 $ 46.8 16.2 Decrease (increase) in Cash and securities segregated for regulatory purposes and securities deposited with clearing organizations 32.7 (26.1 ) 58.8 NM * (Increase) in Securities clearing receivables (128.7 ) (404.4 ) 275.7 68.2 Increase in Securities clearing payables 242.0 301.8 (59.8 ) (19.8 ) Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities for the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions Segment 146.0 (128.7 ) 274.7 NM * Net cash flows provided by operating activities, as reported $ 482.0 $ 160.5 $ 321.5 NM * * Not Meaningful Net cash flows provided by operating activities, excluding net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities, were $336.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, an increase of $46.8 million, compared to $289.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher collections of trade accounts receivable net of higher payments for income taxes. Net cash flows provided by operating activities for our securities clearing activities at our Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment were $146.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to cash flows used in our securities clearing activities of $128.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increase in net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities was primarily due to increased margin balances of $111.2 million compared to the increase in margin balances of $296.5 million in fiscal year 2007, which required $185.3 million less cash outflow in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007. The remaining increase in net cash flows provided by securities clearing activities was due to the sale of $32.7 million of marketable securities in fiscal year 2008 compared to a purchase of $26.1 million of marketable securities in fiscal year 2007, which resulted in a fiscal year-over-year change of $58.8 million. 46 Table of Contents Net cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 were $52.6 million, an increase of $14.7 million, compared to $37.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increase reflects higher cash usage for capital expenditures of $9.6 million and $6.1 million in cash paid to acquire a new business by our Securities Processing Solutions segment during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $320.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, an increase of $236.4 million, compared to $84.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increase in net cash flows used in financing activities reflects $170.0 million in Payments on Long-term debt and $33.6 million in Dividends paid, partially offset by Proceeds from exercise of stock options of $20.0 million. Income Taxes Before the Distribution, the Company taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, except for U.S. federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company taxable income is included in the income tax returns of ADP or an ADP affiliate. Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company files its own U.S. federal, state and foreign returns. The provision for income taxes is computed as if the Company filed on a combined stand-alone or separate tax return basis, as applicable. The provision for income taxes does not reflect the Company inclusion in the tax returns of ADP or an ADP affiliate. Certain income taxes of the Company were paid by ADP or an ADP affiliate on behalf of the Company. The payment of income taxes by ADP or an ADP affiliate on behalf of the Company is recorded within ADP Net Investment on the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. The Company, headquartered in the U.S., is routinely examined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) as part of the IRS U.S. federal income tax audit of ADP and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. The tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the Company was a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group through March 30, 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidation, the Company is included in any IRS examination of ADP for periods up to and including March 30, 2007. ADP and the Company are currently under IRS audit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998 through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 which is expected to be substantially completed in fiscal year 2009. In addition, the IRS is conducting an examination of fiscal years 2003 through 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP, the U.S. federal income tax payable of the Company for the period ended March 30, 2007, will be assumed by ADP. In addition, any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the IRS attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, will be tax liabilities assumed by ADP. Correspondingly, any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, which are settled favorably with the IRS by ADP will remain with ADP. Accordingly, the Company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to U.S. federal income taxes for the tax period ended March 30, 2007. The tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP also extends to the Company U.S. state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets. Thus, for any foreign or U.S. state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier attributable to the Company business operations, depending on the tax jurisdiction, ADP will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the Company for tax payments the Company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company including the Notes thereto, as of June 30, 2008. Similarly, to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable to the Company business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, ADP will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the Company for the refund received by the Company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement. 47 Table of Contents The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the combined financial condition of the Company or on the Company Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period. Defined Benefit Pension Plans Before the spin-off from ADP on March 30, 2007, certain employees of the Company were covered by ADP domestic defined benefit plans. In addition, certain employees of the Company were part of ADP Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan ( ADP SORP ). The ADP SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which ADP will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers years of service and compensation. Liabilities and assets related to these plans remain with ADP. Domestic pension expense allocated to the Company for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 was $3.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively. ADP SORP expense allocated to the Company for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 was $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The Company Board of Directors approved a Broadridge sponsored Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan ( Broadridge SORP ). The Broadridge SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers years of service and compensation. The amount charged to expense for the Broadridge SORP was $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively. Broadridge management believes the ADP SORP expense allocation and the Broadridge SORP are not material to the Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of June 30, 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years (in millions) Long-term debt(1) $ 447.9 $ $ $ 200.0 $ 247.9 Operating lease and software licenses(2) 148.8 40.3 83.8 24.7 Purchase obligations(3) 376.5 93.1 283.4 Total $ 973.2 $ 133.4 $ 367.2 $ 224.7 $ 247.9 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of Long-term debt and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2008, we had $447.9 million of outstanding debt consisting of $200.0 million of a term loan facility and $247.9 million in Senior Notes. See Notes 11, Borrowings and 12, Regulatory Requirements to our Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our Borrowings and related matters. Excludes future cash payments related to interest expense as the term loan facility is variable rate and the interest payments will ultimately be determined by the rates in effect during each period. (2) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements It is not the Company business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at June 30, 2008 and 2007. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company products and services.
