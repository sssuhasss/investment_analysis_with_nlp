Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and ingot prices; production and shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt]) Overview Our Business Alcoa is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Alcoa innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. 50 Table of Contents Alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Aluminum (primary and fabricated) and alumina represent approximately 80% of Alcoa revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the U.S. and Europe generated 51% and 26%, respectively, of Alcoa sales in 2013. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in, among others, Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. Management Review of 2013 and Outlook for the Future In 2013, growth in global aluminum demand reached 7%, which was consistent with management projection at the end of 2012; however, LME pricing levels declined on average 9% year-over-year. The continued weakness in the primary aluminum market led management to review existing high cost capacity for potential curtailment or shut down, resulting in 277 kmt of capacity taken offline in 2013 with another potential 183 kmt to be removed in 2014. Additionally, from a nonoperational perspective, the outlook for the smelting operations led to two significant, unusual noncash negative impacts to Alcoa results related to the impairment of goodwill and the potential future realizability of certain deferred tax assets. The Company was able to more than offset cost headwinds with continued net productivity improvements across all operations. Additionally, the midstream and downstream operations continue to grow revenue through share gains and innovation while generating significant profits for the Company. Management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows generating incremental improvements in procurement efficiencies, overhead rationalization, working capital, and disciplined capital spending. These actions enabled Alcoa to decrease debt while maintaining a stable level of cash on hand, resulting in a strengthened balance sheet. The following financial information reflects some key measures of Alcoa 2013 results: Sales of $23,032 and Loss from continuing operations of $2,285, or $2.14 per diluted share; Total segment after-tax operating income of $1,217, of which 80% was generated from the midstream and downstream operations; Cash from operations of $1,578, reduced by pension contributions of $462; Capital expenditures of $1,193, under $1,500 for the fourth consecutive year; Cash on hand at the end of the year of $1,437, in excess of $1,400 for the fifth consecutive year; Decrease in total debt of $510, and a decline of $2,259 since 2008; and Debt-to-capital ratio of 38.1%. In 2014, management is projecting continued growth (increase of 7%) in the global consumption of primary aluminum, consistent with that of the last two years. All regions, except Europe, are expected to have three-to-eight percent increases in aluminum demand over 2013 with China (10%) expected to have the highest growth rate in 2014. After considering forecasted added production, along with few industry-wide capacity curtailments, management anticipates a balanced aluminum market. For alumina, growth in global consumption is estimated to be 9%, and supply is expected to slightly exceed overall demand due to new capacity in Australia, Saudi Arabia, and India, combined with added production in China. Management also anticipates improved market conditions for value-add products in the aerospace, building and construction, packaging, and automotive global end markets, despite declines in certain regions. Aerospace is expected to be driven by large commercial aircraft, as well as strength in regional and business jets. As it relates to building and 51 Table of Contents construction, awarded nonresidential contracts are up in North America while the decline in Europe is slowing down. The packaging market continues to see a conversion from steel cans to aluminum cans for existing products and the emergence of new products is increasing. For automotive, growth continues in both the U.S., as automakers strive to meet stricter emissions regulations, and China, due to a higher percentage of the population driving automobiles. Conversely, management expects a decline in the industrial gas turbine global end market due to pressure from low price coal in Europe and rising gas prices in the U.S. In the commercial transportation global end market, growth in the U.S., as orders and backlog have increased significantly, is expected to be offset by declines in Europe, due to regulatory change in emissions requirements. On a company-wide basis, management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2014: generating incremental savings over those realized in the previous five years from procurement, overhead, and working capital programs; generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending; and achieving a debt-to-capital ratio between 30% and 35%. Looking ahead over the next one to three years, management will focus on new strategic targets that build on the ones established three years ago. Previously, these targets included lowering Alcoa refining and smelting operations on the cost curve to the 23rd (from 30th) and 41st (from 51st) percentiles, respectively, by 2015 and driving revenue growth, while improving margins that exceed historical levels, in the midstream (increase of $2,500) and downstream (increase of $1,600) operations by 2013. Management made significant progress on the 2010 targets as described below. At December 31, 2013, Alcoa refining operations were in the 27th percentile, a three-percentage point improvement, and smelting operations were in the 43rd percentile, an eight-percentage point improvement, on the respective cost curves. In 2013, actions taken to improve Alcoa position on the cost curve for both refining and smelting operations included productivity improvements, which encompassed new initiatives as well as the full capitalization of initiatives implemented in 2012. Additionally, for the smelting operations, management initiated a permanent shutdown of 146 kmt of capacity in Canada and the U.S. combined and a temporary curtailment of 131 kmt of capacity in Brazil, virtually all of which was completed during the second half of 2013. These decisions were based on a 460 kmt smelting capacity review initiated by management in May 2013. The review of the remaining 183 kmt is expected to be completed in the first half of 2014 (see Primary Metals in Segment Information below). The new targets for the refining and smelting operations are to further extend the 2015 target reductions on the cost curve by an additional two-percentage points and three-percentage points, respectively, by 2016, resulting in attaining the 21st percentile and 38th percentile, respectively. The full operation of the smelter and the refinery at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia is expected to provide a two-percentage point reduction on each of the respective cost curves. Additionally, initiatives to drive further productivity improvements will continue. The new targets for the midstream and downstream operations are to increase revenue, while improving margins that meet or exceed historical levels, by $1,000 and $1,200, respectively, by 2016, of which 90% and 75%, respectively, is expected to be generated from innovation and share gains. A portion of the revenue increase for the midstream operations is expected to be generated from the expansion of the rolling facilities in both Davenport, IA (beginning in 2014) and in Tennessee (beginning in 2015) to meet rising U.S. automotive demand due to changing emission regulations and the construction of the rolling mill as part of a joint venture in Saudi Arabia (began in December 2013, additional automotive capacity by the end of 2014). For the downstream operations, the expansion of aluminum lithium capabilities in Lafayette, IN (beginning end of 2014) to meet the growing demand in the aerospace market is expected to contribute to the increase in revenue. 52 Table of Contents Results of Operations Earnings Summary Loss from continuing operations attributable to Alcoa for 2013 was $2,285, or $2.14 per diluted share, compared with Income from continuing operations attributable to Alcoa of $191, or $0.18 per share, in 2012. The decrease of $2,476 in the results from continuing operations was mostly due to an impairment of goodwill, a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets, and charges for the resolution of a legal matter. Other significant changes in the results from continuing operations included the following: lower realized prices for aluminum in the upstream and midstream businesses, higher input costs across three of the four segments, the absence of a gain on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets, and restructuring and other charges related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity. These other changes were mostly offset by net productivity improvements, net favorable foreign currency movements, the absence of both a net charge for certain environmental remediation matters and a charge for the civil portion of a legal matter, and stronger volumes in three of the four segments. Income from continuing operations attributable to Alcoa for 2012 was $191, or $0.18 per share, compared with $614, or $0.55 per share, in 2011. The decline of $423 in the results from continuing operations was primarily due to the following: lower realized prices for aluminum and alumina, higher input costs, and charges for the civil portion of a legal matter and certain environmental remediation matters. These items were partially offset by net productivity improvements, a gain on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets, a decline in the results attributable to noncontrolling interests, lower restructuring charges, net favorable foreign currency movements, lower income taxes due to a decline in operating results, a favorable LIFO (last in, first out) impact, and higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments. Net loss attributable to Alcoa for 2013 was $2,285, or $2.14 per share, compared with Net income attributable to Alcoa of $191, or $0.18 per share, in 2012, and Net income attributable to Alcoa of $611, or $0.55 per share, in 2011. In 2011, net income of $611 included a loss from discontinued operations of $3 (see Loss From Discontinued Operations below). Sales Sales for 2013 were $23,032 compared with sales of $23,700 in 2012, a decline of $668, or 3%. The decrease was primarily due to lower primary aluminum volumes, including those related to curtailed and shutdown smelter capacity; a decline in realized prices for aluminum, driven by lower London Metal Exchange (LME) prices; and unfavorable pricing in the midstream segment due to a decrease in metal prices; somewhat offset by higher volumes in the Alumina, midstream, and downstream segments. Sales for 2012 were $23,700 compared with sales of $24,951 in 2011, a decrease of $1,251, or 5%. The decline was mainly the result of a drop in realized prices for aluminum and alumina, driven by lower LME prices, unfavorable pricing in the midstream segment due to a decrease in metal prices, and unfavorable foreign currency movements, mostly due to a weaker euro, somewhat offset by higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments and favorable product mix in the midstream segment. Cost of Goods Sold COGS as a percentage of Sales was 83.7% in 2013 compared with 86.1% in 2012. The percentage was positively impacted by net productivity improvements across all segments, the absence of a net charge for five environmental remediation matters ($194), net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and a positive impact related to the March 2012 fire at the cast house in Massena, NY (insurance recovery in 2013 plus the absence of business interruption and repair costs that occurred in 2012). These items were partially offset by the previously mentioned realized price impacts and higher input costs, including those related to bauxite mining and planned maintenance outages at various power plants. COGS as a percentage of Sales was 86.1% in 2012 compared with 82.1% in 2011. The percentage was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned lower realized prices in the upstream and midstream segments, higher input costs, and a net charge for five environmental remediation matters ($194). These items were somewhat offset by net 53 Table of Contents productivity improvements, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and a change in LIFO adjustments from unfavorable to favorable, primarily due to lower prices for alumina and metal and lower costs for calcined coke. Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses SG&A expenses were $1,008, or 4.4% of Sales, in 2013 compared with $997, or 4.2% of Sales, in 2012. The increase of $11 was principally the result of higher labor costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional expenses and contract services and lower bad debt expense. SG&A expenses were $997, or 4.2% of Sales, in 2012 compared with $1,027, or 4.1% of Sales, in 2011. The decline of $30 was mostly due to lower stock-based compensation expense; a decrease in bad debt expense due to the absence of charges for anticipated customer credit losses, primarily related to those in Europe; a decline in travel expense; and less spending across various other expenses. These items were partially offset by higher pension costs, due to the recognition of higher net actuarial losses, and increased professional expenses, due to consulting fees associated with productivity initiatives and higher legal expenses. Research and Development Expenses R&D expenses were $192 in 2013 compared with $197 in 2012 and $184 in 2011. The decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012 was mainly driven by lower spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the Primary Metals segment and other various projects, mostly offset by new spending related to an upgrade of a Micromill in San Antonio, TX for the Global Rolled Products segment. This upgrade is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 and, as a result, the Micromill will develop and qualify aluminum products for the automotive and packaging end markets. The increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily caused by additional spending related to inert anode technology for the Primary Metals segment. Provision for Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization The provision for DD&A was $1,421 in 2013 compared with $1,460 in 2012. The decrease of $39, or 3%, was mostly due to net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, particularly against the Australian dollar and Brazilian real; a reduction in expense related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity in Canada, the U.S., and Italy that occurred mid 2013; and the absence of expense due to the divestiture of U.S. hydroelectric power assets in late 2012. These declines were slightly offset by new depreciation associated with a hydroelectric power project in Brazil (Machadinho). In early 2013, there was a change in the legal structure of the entity that owned the project resulting in Alcoa recording its 30.99% share of the project assets directly, whereas in 2012, Alcoa share was recorded as an equity method investment. The provision for DD&A was $1,460 in 2012 compared with $1,479 in 2011. The decrease of $19, or 1%, was principally the result of the cessation of DD&A due to the decision at the end of 2011 to permanently shut down and demolish the smelter in Tennessee (see Restructuring and Other Charges below) and the absence of DD&A on various in-use assets that reached the end of their estimated useful life in 2011. These declines were partially offset by an increase related to assets placed into service associated with a new hydroelectric power project in Brazil (Estreito) and higher DD&A due to the capitalization of new haul roads and the write-off of old haul roads no longer in use for mining sites in Australia. Impairment of Goodwill In 2013, Alcoa recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of $1,731 ($1,719 after noncontrolling interest) related to the annual impairment review of the Primary Metals segment (see Goodwill in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below). 54 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 were comprised of the following: 2013 2012 2011 Resolution of a legal matter $ 391 $ 85 $ - Layoff costs 201 47 93 Asset impairments 116 40 150 Other 82 21 61 Reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs (8 ) (21 ) (23 ) Restructuring and other charges $ 782 $ 172 $ 281 Layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans. 2013 Actions. In 2013, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $782 ($585 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $391 ($305 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) related to a legal matter; $245 ($183 after-tax) for exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain structures at three smelter locations (see below); $87 ($61 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for layoff costs, including the separation of approximately 1,110 employees (340 in the Primary Metals segment, 260 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 250 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 85 in the Alumina segment, and 175 in Corporate), of which 590 relates to a global overhead reduction program, and $9 in pension plan settlement charges related to previously separated employees; $25 ($17 after-tax) in net charges, including $12 ($8 after-tax) for asset impairments, related to retirements and/or the sale of previously idled structures; $25 ($13 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for asset impairments related to the write-off of capitalized costs for projects no longer being pursued due to the market environment; a net charge of $17 ($12 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for other miscellaneous items, including $3 ($2 after-tax) for asset impairments; and $8 ($6 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods. In May 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of (i) two potlines (capacity of 105 kmt-per-year) that utilize Soderberg technology at the smelter located in Baie Comeau, Qu bec, Canada (remaining capacity of 280 kmt-per-year composed of two prebake potlines) and (ii) the smelter located in Fusina, Italy (capacity of 44 kmt-per-year). Additionally, in August 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline (capacity of 41 kmt-per-year) that utilizes Soderberg technology at the Massena East, N.Y. smelter (remaining capacity of 84 kmt-per-year composed of two Soderberg potlines see Primary Metals in Segment Information below). The aforementioned Soderberg lines at Baie Comeau and Massena East were fully shut down by the end of September 2013 while the Fusina smelter was previously temporarily idled in 2010. Demolition and remediation activities related to all three facilities began in late 2013 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2014 (Massena East), 2015 (Baie Comeau), and 2017 (Fusina). The decisions on the Soderberg lines for Baie Comeau and Massena East are part of a 15-month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in May 2013 for possible curtailment, while the decision on the Fusina smelter is in addition to the capacity being reviewed. Factors leading to all three decisions were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included, among others: lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution (Italy); changed market fundamentals; other existing idle capacity; and restart costs. The remaining 183 kmt of smelting capacity subject to this review is expected to be completed during the first half of 2014 (see Primary Metals in Segment Information below). As such, future restructuring charges may be recognized if the decision to shut down more capacity is made in 2014. In 2013, exit costs related to these actions included $114 for the layoff of approximately 550 employees (Primary Metals segment), including $83 in pension costs; accelerated depreciation of $58 (Baie Comeau) and asset impairments 55 Table of Contents of $18 (Fusina and Massena East) representing the write-off of the remaining book value of all related properties, plants, and equipment; and $55 in other exit costs. Additionally in 2013, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies and raw materials, were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of $9 ($6 after-tax), which was recorded in Cost of goods sold on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The other exit costs of $55 represent $48 in asset retirement obligations and $5 in environmental remediation, both triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish these structures, and $2 in other related costs. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 1,020 of the 1,660 employees were separated. The remaining separations for the 2013 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2014. In 2013, cash payments of $33 were made against layoff reserves related to the 2013 restructuring programs. 2012 Actions. In 2012, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $172 ($106 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $85 ($33 after-tax and noncontrolling interest) related to the civil portion of a legal matter; $47 ($29 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the layoff of approximately 800 employees (390 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, 250 in the Primary Metals segment, 85 in the Alumina segment, and 75 in Corporate), including $10 ($7 after-tax) for the layoff of an additional 170 employees related to the previously reported smelter curtailments in Spain (see 2011 Actions below); $30 ($30 after-tax) in asset impairments and $6 ($6 after-tax) for lease and contract termination costs due to a decision to exit the lithographic sheet business in Bohai, China; $11 ($11 after-tax) in costs to idle the Portovesme smelter (see 2011 Actions below); $10 ($8 after-tax) in other asset impairments; a net charge of $4 ($4 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for other miscellaneous items; and $21 ($15 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods, including $10 ($7 after-tax) related to the smelters in Spain. The reversal related to the smelters in Spain is due to lower than expected costs based on agreements with employee representatives and the government, as well as a reduction of 55 in the number of layoffs due to the anticipation of the restart of a portion of the previously curtailed capacity based on an agreement with the Spanish government that will provide interruptibility rights (i.e. compensation for power interruptions when grids are overloaded) to the smelters during 2013. A portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded at the end of 2011 (see 2011 Actions below) and a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded during 2012 (see above). As of December 31, 2013, the separations associated with 2012 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2013 and 2012, cash payments of $17 and $16, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to the 2012 restructuring programs. 2011 Actions. In 2011, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $281 ($181 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $127 ($82 after-tax) in asset impairments and $36 ($23 after-tax) in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at two U.S. locations (see below); $93 ($68 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the layoff of approximately 1,600 employees (820 in the Primary Metals segment, 470 in the Global Rolled Products segment, 160 in the Alumina segment, 20 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, and 130 in Corporate), including the effects of planned smelter curtailments (see below); $23 ($12 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for other asset impairments, including the write-off of the carrying value of an idled structure in Australia that processed spent pot lining and adjustments to the fair value of the one remaining foil location while it was classified as held for sale due to foreign currency movements; $20 ($8 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for a litigation matter related to the former St. Croix location; a net charge of $5 ($4 after-tax) for other miscellaneous items; and $23 ($16 after-tax) for the reversal of previously recorded layoff reserves due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances, including a change in plans for Alcoa aluminum powder facility in Rockdale, TX. In late 2011, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain facilities at two U.S. locations, each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons. The identified facilities are the smelter located in Alcoa, TN (capacity of 215 kmt-per-year) and two potlines (capacity of 76 kmt-per-year) at the smelter located in Rockdale, TX (remaining capacity of 191 kmt-per-year composed of four potlines). Demolition and remediation activities related to these actions began in 2012 and are expected to be completed in 2015 for the Tennessee smelter 56 Table of Contents and in 2013 for the two potlines at the Rockdale smelter (essentially complete at December 31, 2013). This decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility. Factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included, among others: lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution; changed market fundamentals; cost competitiveness; required future capital investment; and restart costs. The asset impairments of $127 represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties, plants, and equipment related to these facilities. Additionally, remaining inventories, mostly operating supplies, were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of $6 ($4 after-tax), which was recorded in Cost of goods sold on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The other exit costs of $36 represent $18 ($11 after-tax) in environmental remediation and $17 ($11 after-tax) in asset retirement obligations, both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures, and $1 ($1 after-tax) in other related costs. Also, at the end of 2011, management approved a partial or full curtailment of three European smelters as follows: Portovesme, Italy (150 kmt-per-year); Avil s, Spain (46 kmt out of 93 kmt-per-year); and La Coru a, Spain (44 kmt out of 87 kmt-per-year). These curtailments were completed by the end of 2012. The curtailment of the Portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility, which would result in future charges, while the curtailments at the two smelters in Spain are planned to be temporary. These actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions, combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices (mid-2011 to late 2011). As a result of these decisions, Alcoa recorded costs of $33 ($31 after-tax) for the layoff of approximately 650 employees. As Alcoa engaged in discussions with the respective employee representatives and governments, additional charges were recognized in 2012 (see 2012 Actions above). As of December 31, 2013, the separations associated with 2011 restructuring programs were essentially complete. In 2013 and 2012, cash payments of $11 and $23, respectively, were made against layoff reserves related to the 2011 restructuring programs. Alcoa does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments. The pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Alumina $ 11 $ 3 $ 39 Primary Metals 295 20 212 Global Rolled Products 15 43 19 Engineered Products and Solutions 27 13 (3 ) Segment total 348 79 267 Corporate 434 93 14 Total restructuring and other charges $ 782 $ 172 $ 281 Interest Expense Interest expense was $453 in 2013 compared with $490 in 2012. The decrease of $37, or 8%, was primarily due to a 7% lower average debt level, which was mostly attributable to lower outstanding long-term debt due to the June 2013 repayment of $422 in 6.00% Notes and payments associated with the loans supporting growth projects in Brazil. Interest expense was $490 in 2012 compared with $524 in 2011. The decline of $34, or 6%, was principally caused by the absence of a $41 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes ($74 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a $33 gain for in-the-money interest rate swaps), somewhat offset by lower capitalized interest ($8). The decrease in capitalized interest was largely attributable to the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil as construction was nearly complete, partially offset by an increase related to the aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Other Income, net Other income, net was $25 in 2013 compared with $341 in 2012. The change of $316 was mainly the result of the absence of a $320 gain on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets (see below). Also, a higher 57 Table of Contents equity loss ($40) related to Alcoa share of the joint venture in Saudi Arabia due to start-up costs and a shutdown of one of the two smelter potlines due to a period of instability was partially offset by net favorable foreign currency movements ($28). Other income, net was $341 in 2012 compared with $87 in 2011. The increase of $254 was mostly due to a gain on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets ($320: see Primary Metals in Segment Information below) and net favorable foreign currency movements ($21). These two items were somewhat offset by lower equity income ($43), largely attributable to Alcoa share of expenses of the joint venture in Saudi Arabia and the absence of a discrete income tax benefit recognized by the consortium related to an investment in a natural gas pipeline in Australia (Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals share of the benefit was $24); the absence of a gain on the sale of land in Australia ($43); and a net unfavorable change in mark-to-market derivative contracts ($39), principally driven by the absence of a favorable change in an energy contract that expired in September 2011. Income Taxes Alcoa effective tax rate was 23.6% in 2013 (provision on a loss) compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs (by (58.6)% points) from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a $1,731 impairment of goodwill (see Impairment of Goodwill above) and a $209 charge for a legal matter (see Restructuring and Other Charges above) that are nondeductible for income tax purposes, a $372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Spain and the U.S. (see Income Taxes in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below), restructuring charges related to operations in Canada (benefit at a lower tax rate) and Italy (no tax benefit) (see Restructuring and Other Charges above), and a $9 discrete income tax charge related to prior year taxes in Spain and Australia. These items were slightly offset by an $18 discrete income tax benefit related to new U.S. tax legislation. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated various expired or expiring temporary business tax provisions through 2013. Two specific temporary business tax provisions that expired in 2011 and impacted Alcoa are the look-through rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations and the research and experimentation credit. The expiration of these two provisions resulted in Alcoa recognizing a higher income tax provision of $18 in 2012. As tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment, Alcoa recognized the previously mentioned discrete income tax benefit in 2013 related to the 2012 tax year to reflect the extension of these provisions. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2013, these two provisions once again expire. Absent a retroactive extension enacted in 2014, Alcoa would recognize a higher income tax provision of $5 in 2014. Alcoa effective tax rate was 50.0% (provision on income) in 2012 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to the tax impact from the gain recognized on the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets (see Primary Metals in Segment Information below) and an $8 discrete income tax charge related to prior year U.S. taxes on certain depletable assets, slightly offset by a $13 discrete income tax benefit related to a change in the legal structure of an investment. Alcoa effective tax rate was 24.0% (provision on income) in 2011 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate mainly due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions. Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2014 will be approximately 45%. However, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation or rate changes, currency fluctuations, ability to realize deferred tax assets, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate. In December 2011, one of the Company subsidiaries in Brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations. During 2013, the application was amended and re-filed and, separately, a similar application was filed for another one of the Company subsidiaries in Brazil. If approved, the tax rate for these subsidiaries will decrease significantly, resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10-year holiday period (would be retroactively effective as of January 1, 2013). Additionally, the net deferred tax asset of one of the subsidiaries would be remeasured 58 Table of Contents at the lower rate in the period the holiday is approved (the net deferred tax asset of the other subsidiary would not be remeasured since it could still be utilized against future earnings of the subsidiary not subject to the tax holiday). This remeasurement would result in a decrease to that subsidiary net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of approximately $50. As of December 31, 2013, Alcoa subsidiaries applications are still pending. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $41 in 2013 compared with Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $29 in 2012. The change of $70 was primarily due to the results of Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), which is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. In 2013, the change in AWAC results was impacted by improved operating results and items related to a legal matter. The increase in AWAC operating results was principally driven by net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements, somewhat offset by an increase in input costs. Completely offsetting the improved operating results of AWAC was the difference between a $384 charge for a legal matter in 2013 and an $85 charge related to the civil portion of the same legal matter in 2012. A description of how these charges for this legal matter impacted Noncontrolling interests follows. The noncontrolling interest share of AWAC charge for a legal matter in 2013 and 2012 was $58 and $34, respectively. In 2012, the $34 was based on the 40% ownership interest of Alumina Limited, while, in 2013, the $58 was based on 15%. The application of a different percentage was due to the criteria in a 2012 allocation agreement between Alcoa and Alumina Limited related to this legal matter being met. Additionally, the $34 charge, as well as costs related to this legal matter, was retroactively adjusted to reflect the terms of the allocation agreement, resulting in a credit to Noncontrolling interests of $41. In summary, Noncontrolling interests included a charge of $17 and $34 related to this legal matter in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $29 in 2012 compared with Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $194 in 2011. The change of $223 was mostly due to lower earnings of AWAC. The decline in AWAC earnings was attributed primarily to lower realized prices, due to a decrease in contractual LME-based pricing, higher input costs, particularly caustic and fuel oil, and an $85 charge for the civil portion of a legal matter ($34 is noncontrolling interest share). These items were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Loss From Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations in 2011 was $3 comprised of an additional loss of $3 ($5 pretax) related to the wire harness and electrical portion (divested in June 2009) of the Electrical and Electronic Solutions (EES) business as a result of a negotiated preliminary settlement related to claims filed in 2010 against Alcoa by Platinum Equity in an insolvency proceeding in Germany, a net gain of $2 ($3 pretax) related to both the wire harness and electrical portion and the electronics portion (divested in December 2009) of the EES business for a number of small post-closing and other adjustments, and a $2 ($2 pretax) reversal of the gain recognized in 2006 related to the sale of the home exteriors business for an adjustment to an outstanding obligation, which was part of the terms of sale. Segment Information Alcoa operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Global Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions. Segment performance under Alcoa management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the after-tax operating income (ATOI) of each segment. Certain items such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; discontinued operations; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income are excluded from segment ATOI. 59 Table of Contents On January 1, 2013, management revised the inventory-costing method used by certain locations within the Global Rolled Products and Engineered Products and Solutions segments, which affects the determination of the respective segment profitability measure, ATOI. Management made the change in order to improve internal consistency and enhance industry comparability. This revision does not impact the consolidated results of Alcoa. Segment information for all prior periods presented was revised to reflect this change. ATOI for all reportable segments totaled $1,217 in 2013, $1,357 in 2012, and $1,885 in 2011. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The following discussion provides shipments, sales, and ATOI data for each reportable segment and production data for the Alumina and Primary Metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Alumina 2013 2012 2011 Alumina production (kmt) 16,618 16,342 16,486 Third-party alumina shipments (kmt) 9,966 9,295 9,218 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of alumina $ 328 $ 327 $ 370 Alcoa average cost per metric ton of alumina* $ 295 $ 310 $ 312 Third-party sales $ 3,326 $ 3,092 $ 3,462 Intersegment sales 2,235 2,310 2,727 Total sales $ 5,561 $ 5,402 $ 6,189 ATOI $ 259 $ 90 $ 607 * Includes all production-related costs, including raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation, depletion, and amortization; and plant administrative expenses. This segment represents a portion of Alcoa upstream operations and consists of the Company worldwide refinery system, including the mining of bauxite, which is then refined into alumina. Alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products. A portion of this segment third-party sales are completed through the use of agents, alumina traders, and distributors. Slightly more than half of Alcoa alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide, while the remainder is used internally by the Primary Metals segment. In 2013, alumina production increased by 276 kmt compared to 2012. The improvement was mostly the result of higher production in the Atlantic refinery system, primarily at the Point Comfort, TX refinery. In 2012, alumina production decreased by 144 kmt compared to 2011. The decline was mainly driven by lower production in the Atlantic refinery system as a result of management plan to reduce annual production capacity by approximately 390 kmt. This decision was made to align production with smelter curtailments initiated at the beginning of 2012 and to reflect prevailing market conditions. The decrease at these refineries was partially offset by higher production at the Pinjarra and Kwinana refineries in Australia, due to system process improvements. Third-party sales for the Alumina segment improved 8% in 2013 compared with 2012, largely attributable to an increase of 7% in volume and positive impacts from moving customer contracts to alumina index pricing and spot pricing, somewhat offset by a decrease in contractual LME-based pricing (fewer sales subject to LME pricing and lower average LME prices for those sales subject to LME pricing). Third-party sales for this segment dropped 11% in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily related to a 12% decline in realized prices, driven by a decrease in contractual LME-based pricing, slightly offset by realized benefits from moving customer contracts to alumina index pricing and from improved spot pricing. 60 Table of Contents Intersegment sales for the Alumina segment declined 3% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily the result of lower demand from the Primary Metals segment. Intersegment sales for this segment decreased 15% in 2012 compared with 2011, principally due to lower realized prices and decreased demand from the Primary Metals segment. ATOI for the Alumina segment increased $169 in 2013 compared with 2012, mainly caused by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, especially against the Australian dollar, and net productivity improvements. These positive impacts were somewhat offset by cost increases for bauxite due to a new mining site in Suriname and a crusher equipment move in Australia, rising natural gas prices in Australia, and higher maintenance costs in Australia and Latin America. ATOI for this segment dropped $517 in 2012 compared with 2011, mostly due to the previously mentioned lower realized prices, higher input costs, particularly caustic and fuel oil, and the absence of a gain on the sale of land in Australia ($30). These negative impacts were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, especially against the Brazilian real. In 2014, the continued shift towards alumina index and spot-pricing is expected to average 65% of third-party shipments. Also, a higher equity loss related to preoperational ramp-up activities at the refinery in Saudi Arabia and overall higher energy prices in this segment refinery system are expected. Primary Metals 2013 2012 2011 Aluminum production (kmt) 3,550 3,742 3,775 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 2,801 3,056 2,981 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of aluminum $ 2,243 $ 2,327 $ 2,636 Alcoa average cost per metric ton of aluminum* $ 2,201 $ 2,287 $ 2,492 Third-party sales $ 6,596 $ 7,432 $ 8,240 Intersegment sales 2,621 2,877 3,192 Total sales $ 9,217 $ 10,309 $ 11,432 ATOI $ (20 ) $ 309 $ 481 * Includes all production-related costs, including raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation and amortization; and plant administrative expenses. This segment represents a portion of Alcoa upstream operations and consists of the Company worldwide smelter system. Primary Metals receives alumina, mostly from the Alumina segment, and produces primary aluminum used by Alcoa fabricating businesses, as well as sold to external customers and traders. Results from the sale of aluminum powder, scrap, and excess power are also included in this segment, as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buy/resell activity. Primary aluminum produced by Alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices. The sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90% of this segment third-party sales. Buy/resell activity occurs when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements. In November 2012, Alcoa completed the sale of its 351-megawatt Tapoco Hydroelectric Project ( Tapoco ) to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners for $597 in cash. Alcoa recognized a gain of $320 ($173 after-tax) in Other income, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations, of which a gain of $426 ($275 after-tax) was reflected in the Primary Metals segment and a loss of $106 ($102 after-tax) was reflected in Corporate. The amount in Corporate represents the write-off of goodwill and capitalized interest related to Tapoco that were not included in the assets of the Primary Metals segment. Tapoco is a four-station hydroelectric project located on the Little Tennessee and Cheoah Rivers in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. The transaction included four generating stations and dams, 86 miles of transmission lines, and approximately 14,500 acres of land associated with and surrounding Tapoco. The power generated by Tapoco was 61 Table of Contents primarily consumed by Alcoa smelter in Tennessee, which was temporarily idled in 2009 and permanently shut down in 2011. Since 2009, the power generated from Tapoco was sold into the open market. At December 31, 2013, Alcoa had 655 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,037 kmt. In 2013, idle capacity increased 64 kmt compared to 2012 mostly due to the temporary curtailment of 131 kmt combined at two smelters in Brazil, partially offset by the permanent closure of the Fusina smelter in Italy (44 kmt-per-year) and the restart of a portion (27 kmt combined) of the capacity that was temporary curtailed in 2012 related to the Avil and La Coru a smelters in Spain. Base capacity declined 190 kmt between December 31, 2013 and 2012 due to the permanent closure of three potlines combined at smelters in Canada and in the U.S. and the previously mentioned permanent shutdown of the Fusina smelter. A detailed description of each of these actions follows. The restarts in Spain occurred in order to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime in the Spanish power market. In December 2012, the Spanish Government issued a Ministerial Order that modified the interruptibility regime previously in place in the Spanish power market. The interruptibility regime allows certain industrial customers who are willing to be subject to temporary interruptions in the supply of power to sell interruption rights to the high voltage transmission system operator. In January 2013, Alcoa applied for and was granted rights to sell interruption services under the modified regime from its San Ciprian, Avil s, and La Coru a smelters in Spain. The commitment is taken for a one-year period, which has since been extended until October 2014. In 2013, the Spanish Government notified the European Commission of the modification in the interruptibility regime for review under European state aid rules. In May 2013, Alcoa announced that management will review 460 kmt of smelting capacity over a 15-month period for possible curtailment. This review is aimed at maintaining Alcoa competitiveness despite falling aluminum prices and will focus on the highest-cost smelting capacity and those plants that have long-term risk due to factors such as energy costs or regulatory uncertainty. As part of this review, also in May 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of two potlines (105 kmt-per-year) that utilize Soderberg technology at the Baie Comeau smelter in Quebec, Canada. Additionally, in August 2013, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline (41 kmt-per-year) that utilizes Soderberg technology at the Massena East, NY plant. The shutdown of these three lines was completed by the end of September 2013. The Baie Comeau smelter has a remaining capacity of 280 kmt-per-year composed of two prebake potlines and the Massena East smelter has a remaining capacity of 84 kmt-per-year composed of two Soderberg potlines. Also in August 2013 as part of this review, management initiated the temporary curtailment of 97 kmt at the S o Lu smelter and 31 kmt at the Po os de Caldas smelter, both in Brazil. This action was also completed by the end of September 2013. An additional 3 kmt was temporarily curtailed at the Po os de Caldas smelter by the end of 2013. The remaining 183 kmt of smelting capacity subject to this review is expected to be completed during the first half of 2014 (see 2014 outlook below). In June 2013, management decided to permanently close the Fusina smelter as the underlying conditions that led to the idling of the smelter in 2010 have not fundamentally changed, including low aluminum prices and the lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution. At December 31, 2012, Alcoa had 591 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,227 kmt. In 2012, idle capacity decreased 53 kmt compared to 2011 due to the permanent shutdown of the smelter in Tennessee (215 kmt-per-year) and two potlines at the smelter located in Rockdale, TX (76 kmt-per-year), mostly offset by the curtailment of the Portovesme smelter in Italy (150 kmt-per-year) and the temporary curtailment of a portion of the smelters in Spain: Avil (46 kmt out of 93 kmt-per-year) and La Coru a (44 kmt out of 87 kmt-per-year). Base capacity declined 291 kmt between December 31, 2012 and 2011 due to the previously mentioned permanent shutdowns. 62 Table of Contents In late 2011, management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the Tennessee smelter and two potlines at the Rockdale smelter (remaining capacity of 191 kmt-per-year composed of four potlines), each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons. This decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility. Factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included, among others: lack of an economically viable, long-term power solution; changed market fundamentals; cost competitiveness; required future capital investment; and restart costs. Also, at the end of 2011, management approved a full curtailment of the Portovesme smelter and a partial curtailment at the Avil and La Coru a smelters. The curtailment of the Portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility, while the curtailments at the two smelters in Spain are planned to be temporary. These actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions, combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices (mid-2011 to late 2011). In 2013, aluminum production declined by 192 kmt, mainly the result of the absence of production at the Portovesme smelter (fully curtailed at the end of 2012), the temporary curtailment of capacity at two smelters in Brazil, and the permanent shutdown of three potlines combined at smelters in Canada and in the U.S. In 2012, aluminum production decreased by 33 kmt, mostly due to the previously mentioned curtailments at the Portovesme, Avil s, and La Coru a smelters, partially offset by the benefit of a full year of production related to capacity restarted in 2011 at the Massena East (125 kmt-per-year), Wenatchee, WA (43 kmt-per-year), and Ferndale, WA (Intalco: 47 kmt-per-year) smelters. Third-party sales for the Primary Metals segment declined 11% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to lower volumes, including from the curtailed smelters in Italy, Spain, and Brazil and the permanent shutdown of certain capacity in Canada and the U.S. Also contributing to the decrease was a 4% decline in average realized prices, somewhat offset by higher energy sales related to excess power, mostly in Brazil, and favorable product mix. The change in realized prices was driven by an 8% lower average LME price (on 15-day lag), somewhat offset by higher regional premiums, including an average of 12% in the U.S and 13% in Europe. Third-party sales for this segment dropped 10% in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly due to a 12% decline in average realized prices, driven by a 16% lower average LME price (on 15-day lag), slightly offset by higher buy/resell activity. The U.S. capacity restarted in 2011 contributed positively to third-party sales in 2012, but was completely offset by the curtailments of European capacity in 2012. Intersegment sales for the Primary Metals segment declined 9% in 2013 compared with 2012, mainly the result of a decrease in both realized prices, driven by a lower LME price, and demand from the midstream and downstream businesses. Intersegment sales for this segment decreased 10% in 2012 compared with 2011, principally due to a decline in realized prices, driven by a lower LME price. ATOI for the Primary Metals segment decreased $329 in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily caused by a decline in realized prices, the absence of a gain on the sale of Tapoco (see above), higher costs for labor and transportation, a higher equity loss related to the joint venture in Saudi Arabia due to start-up costs and a shutdown of one of the two potlines due to a period of instability, and costs related to planned maintenance outages at the Anglesea power plant in Australia and two U.S. power plants. These negative impacts were somewhat offset by lower costs for carbon and energy, net productivity improvements, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar against most major currencies, favorable product mix, and a positive impact (insurance recovery in 2013 plus the absence of business interruption and repair costs that occurred in 2012) related to the March 2012 fire at the Massena West cast house ($36). ATOI for this segment dropped $172 in 2012 compared with 2011, principally related to the previously mentioned decrease in realized prices, higher costs, particularly labor and other raw materials, and an unfavorable impact as a 63 Table of Contents result of business interruption and repair costs related to a fire in March 2012 at the Massena West cast house ($21). These negative impacts were partially offset by a gain on the sale of Tapoco (see above), lower costs for alumina and energy, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro and Brazilian real, and net productivity improvements. In 2014, pricing is expected to follow a 15-day lag on the LME. Also, a higher equity loss related to start-up activities at the smelter in Saudi Arabia (will be fully operational in the second half of 2014) and overall higher energy prices in this segment smelting system are expected. Additionally, the remaining 183 kmt of smelting capacity subject to the management review initiated in May 2013 will be completed (in January 2014 management decided to permanently shut down the remaining 84 kmt at the Massena East smelter). Global Rolled Products 2013 2012 2011 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 1,905 1,867 1,780 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of aluminum $ 3,730 $ 3,953 $ 4,293 Third-party sales $ 7,106 $ 7,378 $ 7,642 Intersegment sales 178 163 218 Total sales $ 7,284 $ 7,541 $ 7,860 ATOI $ 252 $ 346 $ 260 This segment represents Alcoa midstream operations, whose principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate and sheet. A small portion of this segment operations relate to foil produced at one plant in Brazil. This segment includes rigid container sheet (RCS), which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans. Seasonal increases in RCS sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year. Approximately one-half of the third-party sales in this segment consist of RCS. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets, which is sold directly to customers and through distributors. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of RCS, sheet, and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Third-party sales for the Global Rolled Products segment declined 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily driven by unfavorable pricing, mostly due to a decrease in metal prices, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by increased demand. Volume improvements were mostly due to the packaging, automotive, and building and construction end markets, partially offset by a decline in the industrial products end market (especially in North America). Third-party sales for this segment decreased 3% in 2012 compared with 2011, principally caused by unfavorable pricing, due to a decrease in metal prices, and unfavorable foreign currency movements, mostly due to a weaker euro, somewhat offset by higher volumes and favorable product mix. The higher volumes were largely attributable to the packaging, automotive, building and construction, and aerospace end markets, slightly offset by the industrial products end market. ATOI for the Global Rolled Products segment declined $94 in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily attributable to a combination of unfavorable pricing and product mix; higher input costs, including metal premiums, energy, and labor; and a negative impact from the timing lag in metal prices (i.e., this segment realized a lower average metal price in sales compared to the average cost of the metal purchased). These items were partially offset by net productivity improvements across most businesses. ATOI for this segment improved $86 in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly the result of net productivity improvements across all businesses, favorable product mix, and the previously mentioned higher volumes, somewhat offset by higher input costs, particularly labor and transportation. 64 Table of Contents In 2014, automotive demand is expected to remain strong for both auto and brazing sheet, while industrial volumes are expected to strengthen with the recovering economies in the U.S. and Europe. Also, volume and continued pricing pressures are expected to negatively impact the aerospace (due to high original equipment manufacturer inventories) and packaging end markets. Engineered Products and Solutions 2013 2012 2011 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 229 222 221 Third-party sales $ 5,733 $ 5,525 $ 5,345 ATOI $ 726 $ 612 $ 537 This segment represents Alcoa downstream operations and includes titanium, aluminum, and super alloy investment castings; fasteners; aluminum wheels; integrated aluminum structural systems; architectural extrusions; and forgings and hard alloy extrusions. These products, which are used in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation, power generation, and industrial products end markets, are sold directly to customers and through distributors. On March 9, 2011, Alcoa completed an acquisition of the aerospace fastener business of TransDigm Group Inc. for $240. This business is a leading global designer, producer, and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components, with three locations (one in the state of California and two in the United Kingdom) that employ a combined 400 people (at time of acquisition). Specifically, this business provides a wide variety of high-strength, high temperature nickel alloy specialty engine fasteners, airframe bolts, and slotted entry bearings. In 2010, this business generated sales of $61. The assets and liabilities of this business were included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment as of March 31, 2011; this business results of operations were included in this segment beginning March 9, 2011. Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment improved 4% in 2013 compared with 2012, largely attributable to higher volumes related to the aerospace end market. Third-party sales for this segment increased 3% in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to higher volumes, slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro. The higher volumes were mostly related to the aerospace, industrial gas turbine, and commercial transportation end markets, slightly offset by lower volumes from the building and construction end market. ATOI for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment rose $114 in 2013 compared with 2012, principally the result of net productivity improvements across all businesses and the previously mentioned volume impact, somewhat offset by higher costs, including labor and research and development expenses, and unfavorable price/product mix. ATOI for this segment climbed $75 in 2012 compared with 2011, mainly due to net productivity improvements in four of the five businesses and the previously mentioned higher volumes. In 2014, the aerospace end market is expected to remain strong, while the building and construction end market is expected to improve as the gradual recovery in North America continues and the decline in Europe slows down. Also, weaker global demand in the industrial gas turbine end market is anticipated, while stronger North America build rates in the commercial transportation end market will be offset by declines in Europe. Reconciliation of ATOI to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Alcoa Items required to reconcile total segment ATOI to consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Alcoa include: the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; discontinued 65 Table of Contents operations; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gains/losses and interest income. The following table reconciles total segment ATOI to consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Alcoa: 2013 2012 2011 Total segment ATOI $ 1,217 $ 1,357 $ 1,885 Unallocated amounts (net of tax): Impact of LIFO 52 20 (38 ) Interest expense (294 ) (319 ) (340 ) Noncontrolling interests (41 ) 29 (194 ) Corporate expense (284 ) (282 ) (290 ) Impairment of goodwill (1,731 ) - - Restructuring and other charges (607 ) (142 ) (196 ) Discontinued operations - - (3 ) Other (597 ) (472 ) (213 ) Consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Alcoa $ (2,285 ) $ 191 $ 611 The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Alcoa for 2013 compared with 2012 consisted of: a change in the Impact of LIFO, mostly due to lower prices for aluminum, driven by lower LME prices, and significant reductions in LIFO inventory quantities, which caused a partial liquidation of the lower cost LIFO inventory base; a decrease in Interest expense, principally caused by a 7% lower average debt level, which was mostly attributable to lower outstanding long-term debt due to the June 2013 repayment of $422 in 6.00% Notes and payments associated with the loans supporting growth projects in Brazil; a change in Noncontrolling interests, mainly due to improved operating results of AWAC, principally driven by net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements, somewhat offset by an increase in input costs, and a favorable change in charges allocated to Noncontrolling interest related to a legal matter (see Noncontrolling Interests in Earnings Summary above); an Impairment of goodwill related to the annual impairment review of the Primary Metals segment (see Goodwill in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below); an increase in Restructuring and other charges, mostly due to a charge for a legal matter ($322) and exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain structures at three smelter locations ($183), slightly offset by the absence of a charge for the civil portion of a legal matter ($67); and a change in Other, primarily due to a $372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Spain and the U.S., partially offset by the absence of both a net charge for five environmental remediation matters ($129) and a charge for the write-off of goodwill and capitalized interest related to the 2012 sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets that were not included in the assets of the Primary Metals segment ($102). The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net income attributable to Alcoa for 2012 compared with 2011 consisted of: a change in the Impact of LIFO, due to lower prices for alumina and metal, both of which were driven by a decline in LME prices, and lower costs for calcined coke; 66 Table of Contents a decrease in Interest expense, primarily due to the absence of a $27 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes ($48 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a $21 gain for in-the-money interest rate swaps), somewhat offset by lower capitalized interest ($6); a change in Noncontrolling interests, mainly the result of lower earnings of AWAC, principally driven by lower realized prices, due to a decrease in contractual LME-based pricing, higher input costs, particularly caustic and fuel oil, and a charge for the civil portion of a legal matter ($34 is noncontrolling interest share), somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar; a decrease in Restructuring and other charges, principally caused by fewer asset impairments and a lower number of employee separations, partially offset by a charge for the civil portion of a legal matter ($67); and a change in Other, largely attributable to a net charge for five environmental remediation matters ($129), a charge for the write-off of goodwill and capitalized interest related to the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets that were not included in the assets of the Primary Metals segment ($102), and a net unfavorable change in mark-to-market derivative contracts ($24). Environmental Matters See the Environmental Matters section of Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Alcoa maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. In 2013, as in the prior four years, management initiated actions to significantly improve Alcoa cost structure and liquidity, providing the Company with the ability to operate effectively as the global economy continues to recover from the economic downturn that began in 2008. Such actions include procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs, working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements, and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures. In 2014, this approach will continue with the ultimate goal of generating cash from operations that exceeds capital expenditures. Along with the foregoing actions, cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Alcoa current operational and business needs. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below. At December 31, 2013, cash and cash equivalents of Alcoa were $1,437, of which $544 was held outside the U.S. Alcoa has a number of commitments and obligations related to the Company growth strategy in foreign jurisdictions, resulting in the need for cash outside the U.S. As such, management does not have a current expectation of repatriating cash held in foreign jurisdictions. Cash from Operations Cash from operations in 2013 was $1,578 compared with $1,497 in 2012. The increase of $81, or 5%, was largely attributable to higher operating results (net loss plus net add back for noncash impacts to earnings) and lower pension contributions of $99, mostly offset by a negative change associated with all of the following: working capital of $235, noncurrent assets of $162, and noncurrent liabilities of $128. The lower pension contributions were principally driven by a change in minimum funding obligations for U.S. pension plans due to enacted legislation in 2012 (see below). The major components of the negative change in working capital were as follows: an unfavorable change of $245 in receivables; a negative change of $71 in inventories, principally due to a lower LIFO reserve; a favorable change of 67 Table of Contents $53 in prepaid expenses and other current assets, mostly caused by the sale of excess carbon credits in Australia; a positive change of $338 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of timing of payments, including a policy change in Alcoa vendor payment process; an unfavorable change of $252 in accrued expenses, largely attributable to a decrease in deferred revenue and payments made to the Italian Government (see below); and a negative change of $58 in taxes, including income taxes. The unfavorable change in noncurrent assets was mostly related to an increase in deferred mining costs in Australia and the absence of value-added tax receipts in Brazil. The negative change in noncurrent liabilities was largely attributable to the absence of a net increase in the environmental reserve of $194 related to five remediation matters. In 2014, Alcoa World Alumina LLC, a majority-owned subsidiary of Alcoa, and Alcoa Inc. will pay a combined $88 to the United States government due to the resolution of a legal matter (paid on January 22, 2014). Additionally, another $74 will be paid in each of the four subsequent years, 2015 through 2018. Cash from operations in 2012 was $1,497 compared with $2,193 in 2011. The decrease of $696, or 32%, was primarily due to lower operating results, higher pension contributions of $225, and an unfavorable change associated with working capital of $141, somewhat offset by a favorable change of $445 in noncurrent liabilities and a positive change of $163 in noncurrent assets. The higher pension contributions were principally driven by the fact that in 2012 all contributions to the U.S. pension plans were made in cash, whereas, in 2011, a $600 noncash contribution to the U.S. pension plans was made in the form of Company common stock. The major components of the unfavorable change in working capital were as follows: a favorable change of $219 in receivables, primarily related to fewer uncollected receivables related to sales programs and lower customer sales; a positive change of $435 in inventories, mostly due to lower levels of on-hand alumina and aluminum products and a decrease in the LME price of aluminum; a negative change of $139 in prepaid expenses and other current assets, largely attributable to the absence of a reduction in collateral posted related to mark-to-market derivative contracts and an increase in both excess carbon emission credits and prepayments for natural gas in Australia; an unfavorable change of $406 in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of timing of payments; a negative change of $150 in accrued expenses, largely attributable to a payment made to the Italian Government (see below), a decrease in deferred revenue, a payment made in the civil portion of a litigation matter (see below), and the absence of a charge related to the former St. Croix location; and a negative change of $100 in taxes, including income taxes, mainly due to less income taxes caused by lower operating results, somewhat offset by an income tax refund received for the carryback of a loss from a prior year in Canada. The favorable change in noncurrent liabilities was primarily caused by a net increase in the environmental reserve of $194 related to five remediation matters, higher accrual for pension plans, and an increase in deferred revenue related to a contract to deliver sheet and plate to a customer beginning in 2014. In June 2012, Alcoa received formal notification from the Italian Government requesting a net payment of $310 ( 250) related to a November 2009 European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters. Alcoa commenced payment of the requested amount in five quarterly installments of $69 ( 50) beginning in October 2012 through December 2013. On July 6, 2012, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21) was signed into law by the United States government. MAP-21, in part, provides temporary relief for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Specifically, MAP-21 allows for the use of a 25-year average interest rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations instead of an average interest rate for the two most recent years. This relief had an immediate impact on the calculation of the then remaining funding contributions in 2012, resulting in 68 Table of Contents a reduction of $130 in minimum required pension funding. In 2013, this relief resulted in a reduction of $250 in minimum required pension funding. On October 9, 2012, Alcoa World Alumina LLC, a majority-owned subsidiary of Alcoa, paid $42.5 to the plaintiff of the civil portion of a legal matter pursuant to a settlement agreement. The remaining $42.5 was paid on October 9, 2013. Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities was $679 in 2013 compared with cash used for financing activities of $798 in 2012 and cash provided from financing activities of $62 in 2011. The use of cash in 2013 was primarily due to $2,317 in payments on debt, mainly related to $1,850 for the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below), a $422 early repayment of 6.00% Notes due July 2013, and $27 for previous borrowings on the loans supporting the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; $132 in dividends paid to shareholders; and net cash paid to noncontrolling interests of $97, most of which relates to Alumina Limited share of AWAC. These items were partially offset by $1,852 in additions to debt, virtually all of which was the result of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below). The use of cash in 2012 was principally the result of $1,489 in payments on debt, mainly related to $600 for the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below), $322 for the repayment of 6% Notes due 2012 as scheduled, $280 for the repayment of short-term loans to support the export operations of a subsidiary in Brazil, and $272 for previous borrowings on the loans supporting the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, and Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; a change of $224 in commercial paper; and $131 in dividends paid to shareholders. These items were partially offset by $972 in additions to debt, due to $600 in borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities (see below), $280 in short-term loans to support the export operations of a subsidiary in Brazil, and $92 in borrowings under loans that support the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; and net cash received from noncontrolling interests of $76, all of which relates to Alumina Limited share of AWAC. The source of cash in 2011 was mostly driven by $1,256 in additions to long-term debt, of which $1,248 was for the issuance of 5.40% Notes due 2021, and a change of $224 in commercial paper. These items were mostly offset by $1,194 in payments on long-term debt, principally related to $881 for the early retirement of all of the 5.375% Notes due 2013 and a portion of the 6.00% Notes due 2013, $217 for previous borrowings on the loans supporting the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, and Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil, and $45 for a loan associated with the Samara, Russia facility; net cash distributed to noncontrolling interests of $88, all of which relates to Alumina Limited share of AWAC; and $131 in dividends paid to shareholders. As a result of an agreement between Alcoa and Alumina Limited in September 2012, Alcoa of Australia (part of the AWAC group of companies) made minimum dividend payments to Alumina Limited of $100 in 2013. Alcoa has outstanding $575 of 5.25% convertible notes due on March 15, 2014, which are included in Long-term debt due within one year on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013. The notes are payable in cash at maturity unless holders exercise their option by the close of business on March 13, 2014 to convert the notes into shares of Alcoa common stock. The initial conversion rate provided under the terms of the Notes is 155.4908 shares of common stock per $1,000 (whole dollars) principal amount of notes, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $6.43 per share of common stock. Alcoa maintains a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated July 25, 2011, (the Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. The Credit Agreement provides a $3,750 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ), the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Alcoa. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, Alcoa may from 69 Table of Contents time to time request increases in lender commitments under the Credit Facility, not to exceed $500 in aggregate principal amount, and may also request the issuance of letters of credit, subject to a letter of credit sublimit of $1,000 under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on July 25, 2016; however, on December 7, 2012, Alcoa received approval for a one-year extension of the maturity date by the lenders and issuers that support $3,700 of the Credit Facility (approval for the remaining $50 was received on January 8, 2013). As such, the Credit Facility now matures on July 25, 2017, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Alcoa may make one additional one-year extension request during the remaining term of the Credit Facility, subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, Alcoa will pay a fee of 0.25% (based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2013) of the total commitment per annum to maintain the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Alcoa. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Alcoa outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate loans and LIBOR loans will be 0.50% and 1.50% per annum, respectively, based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2013. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. The Credit Agreement includes the following covenants, among others, (a) a leverage ratio, (b) limitations on Alcoa ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (c) limitations on Alcoa ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (d) limitations on Alcoa ability to change the nature of its business. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, Alcoa was in compliance with all such covenants. The obligation of Alcoa to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Alcoa failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Alcoa in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Alcoa breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Alcoa. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012 and no amounts were borrowed during 2013 or 2012 under the Credit Facility. In 2012, Alcoa entered into two term loan agreements and six revolving credit agreements, providing a combined borrowing capacity of $990, each with a different financial institution. The two term loan agreements (totaling $350) and one of the revolving credit agreements ($150) were terminated during 2012 and 2013, respectively, upon repayment of existing borrowings. Also, in 2013, four of the revolving credit agreements were due to expire, and, therefore, were extended to September 2014 through September 2015. In 2013, Alcoa entered into five additional credit arrangements, one term loan agreement (later replaced with a revolving credit agreement) and four revolving credit agreements, providing a combined borrowing capacity of $700, each with a different financial institution. These five additional revolving credit agreements expire between February 2014 and December 2014 (two of these agreements were originally due to expire in 2013). The purpose of any borrowings under all arrangements in both 2013 and 2012 was to provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including contributions to Alcoa pension plans. The covenants contained in all the arrangements are the same as the Credit Agreement (see above). In 2013 and 2012, Alcoa borrowed and repaid $1,850 and $600, respectively, under the respective credit arrangements. The weighted-average interest rate and weighted-average days outstanding of the respective borrowings during 2013 and 2012 were 1.57% and 1.89%, respectively, and 213 days and 260 days, respectively. 70 Table of Contents In summary, at December 31, 2013, Alcoa has ten revolving credit facilities (excluding the Credit Facility above), providing a combined capacity of $1,190, of which $1,040 is due to expire in 2014 and $150 is due to expire in 2015. In February 2011, Alcoa filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance. This shelf registration statement replaced Alcoa existing shelf registration statement (filed in March 2008). As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, $1,250 in senior debt securities were issued under the current shelf registration statement. Alcoa cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Alcoa debt by the major credit rating agencies. On April 11, 2013, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) affirmed the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt at BBB- and short-term debt at F3. Additionally, Fitch changed the current outlook from stable to negative. On April 26, 2013, Standard and Poor Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt at BBB- and short-term debt at A-3. Additionally, S&P changed the current outlook from stable to negative. On May 29, 2013, Moody Investors Service (Moody s) downgraded the following ratings for Alcoa: long-term debt from Baa3 to Ba1 and short-term debt from Prime-3 to Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating-1. Additionally, Moody changed the current outlook from rating under review to stable. The following is a summary of Alcoa liquidity position as it relates to the ratings downgrade by Moody s. Cash and letters of credit. As a result of the ratings downgrade by Moody s, certain power companies and counterparties to derivative contracts required Alcoa to post letters of credit and cash collateral, respectively, in the amount of $167 and $18, respectively, in June 2013. During the remainder of 2013, the amount of letters of credit posted increased by $2 and the amount of cash collateral posted declined to $6. Other vendors and third-parties may require Alcoa to post additional letters of credit and/or cash collateral in future periods. Outstanding debt. Alcoa outstanding debt as of December 31, 2013 totaled $8,319. There were no ramifications to Alcoa as a result of the ratings downgrade and interest payments and fees related to the outstanding debt remain unchanged. Revolving credit facilities. Alcoa has a $3,750 revolving credit facility that expires in July 2017 and ten other revolving credit facilities totaling $1,190. This $4,940 of borrowing capacity was also unaffected by the ratings downgrade, including the margins that would be applicable to any borrowings, and remains available for use by Alcoa at its discretion. Commercial paper. During the seven months since the downgrade, Alcoa was able to issue the desired level of commercial paper to support operations without difficulty. At the time of the downgrade, the spreads on commercial paper increased slightly, however, by one to three basis points, which did not result in a significant change to Alcoa total interest costs. While Alcoa expects it can continue to issue commercial paper, there is no assurance about the amount or cost at which it could issue commercial paper. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities was $1,290 in 2013 compared with $759 in 2012 and $1,852 in 2011. The use of cash in 2013 was primarily due to $1,193 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $143), 34% of which related to growth projects, including the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant, the aluminum-lithium capacity expansion at the Lafayette, IN plant, and the automotive sheet expansion at the Alcoa, TN plant; and $293 in additions to investments, including equity 71 Table of Contents contributions of $171 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia and the purchase of $54 in equities and fixed income securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company. These items were slightly offset by a net change in restricted cash of $170, mostly related to the release of funds to be used for capital expenditures of the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant (see Noncash Financing and Investing Activities below). The use of cash in 2012 was mainly due to $1,261 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $153), 33% of which related to growth projects, including the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant and the Estreito hydroelectric power project; and $300 in additions to investments, principally for the equity contributions of $253 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia. These items were somewhat offset by $615 in proceeds from the sale of assets, mostly the result of $597 received for the sale of U.S. hydroelectric power assets (see Primary Metals in Segment Information above), and a net change in restricted cash of $87, principally related to the release of funds to be used for capital expenditures of the automotive expansion at the Davenport, IA fabrication plant (see Noncash Financing and Investing Activities below). The use of cash in 2011 was principally due to $1,287 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $148), 28% of which related to growth projects, including the Estreito hydroelectric power project and Juruti bauxite mine development; $374 in additions to investments, mostly for the equity contributions of $249 related to the aluminum complex joint venture in Saudi Arabia and purchase of $41 in available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company; and $239 (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of an aerospace fastener business. These items were slightly offset by $54 in sales of investments, primarily related to available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance company, and $38 in proceeds from the sale of assets, mainly attributable to the sale of land in Australia. Noncash Financing and Investing Activities In August 2012, Alcoa received a loan of $250 for the purpose of financing all or part of the cost of acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, and renovating certain facilities at Alcoa rolling mill plant in Davenport, IA. Because this loan can only be used for this purpose, the net proceeds of $248 were classified as restricted cash. Since restricted cash is not part of cash and cash equivalents, this transaction was not reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as it represents a noncash activity. As funds are expended for the project, the release of the cash will be reflected as both an inflow on the Net change in restricted cash line and an outflow on the Capital expenditures line in the Investing Activities section of the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, Alcoa had $13 and $171, respectively, of restricted cash remaining related to this transaction. 72 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations. Alcoa is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, financing arrangements, and lease agreements. Alcoa also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. As of December 31, 2013, a summary of Alcoa outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information): Total 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 Thereafter Operating activities: Energy-related purchase obligations $ 15,511 $ 1,490 $ 2,563 $ 2,826 $ 8,632 Raw material purchase obligations 6,389 1,839 1,017 726 2,807 Other purchase obligations 946 149 152 137 508 Operating leases 925 198 300 183 244 Interest related to total debt 4,159 461 873 807 2,018 Estimated minimum required pension funding 2,570 625 1,175 770 - Other postretirement benefit payments 2,485 260 520 510 1,195 Layoff and other restructuring payments 138 107 29 2 - Deferred revenue arrangements 164 13 36 36 79 Uncertain tax positions 74 - - - 74 Financing activities: Total debt 8,300 715 60 1,824 5,701 Dividends to shareholders - - - - - Investing activities: Capital projects 1,094 612 412 38 32 Equity contributions 268 151 117 - - Payments related to acquisitions - - - - - Totals $ 43,023 $ 6,620 $ 7,254 $ 7,859 $ 21,290 Obligations for Operating Activities Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from 1 year to 34 years. Raw material obligations consist mostly of bauxite (relates to Alcoa bauxite mine interests in Guinea and Brazil), caustic soda, alumina, aluminum fluoride, calcined petroleum coke, cathode blocks, and various metals with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 19 years. Other purchase obligations consist principally of freight for bauxite and alumina with expiration dates ranging from 1 to 18 years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, alumina refinery process control technology, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment. Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2013 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042. The effect of outstanding interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, was included in interest related to total debt. As of December 31, 2013, these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on $200 of debt through 2018. As the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates, among others. The minimum required contributions for pension funding are estimated 73 Table of Contents to be $625 for 2014, $625 for 2015, $550 for 2016, $440 for 2017, and $330 for 2018. These expected pension contributions reflect the impacts of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act. The expected decline in pension contributions assumes that all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future. Other postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate $255 to $260 annually for years 2014 through 2018 and $240 annually for years 2019 through 2023. Such payments will be slightly offset by subsidy receipts related to Medicare Part D, which are estimated to be approximately $25 to $30 annually for years 2014 through 2023. Alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2018 and 2023, respectively. Layoff and other restructuring payments expected to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs. Amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to lease termination costs, ongoing site remediation work, and special termination benefit payments. Deferred revenue arrangements require Alcoa to deliver alumina and sheet and plate to certain customers over the specified contract period (through 2027 for an alumina contract and through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract). While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made. Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2013. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the Thereafter column as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. Obligations for Financing Activities Total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Maturities for long-term debt extend to 2042. Alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Alcoa paid $132 in dividends to shareholders during 2013. Because all dividends are subject to approval by Alcoa Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2013, there were 1,071,011,162 and 546,024 shares of outstanding common stock and preferred stock, respectively. The annual preferred stock dividend is at the rate of $3.75 per share and the annual common stock dividend is $0.12 per share. Obligations for Investing Activities Capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2013. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $1,250 in 2014. Equity contributions represent Alcoa committed investment related to a joint venture in Saudi Arabia. Alcoa is a participant in a joint venture to develop a new aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia, comprised of a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter, and rolling mill, which will require the Company to contribute approximately $1,100. As of December 31, 2013, Alcoa has made equity contributions of $832. The timing of the amounts included in the preceding table may vary based on changes in anticipated construction schedules of the project. Payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from Alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds. Amounts 74 Table of Contents are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur. In connection with the 2005 acquisition of two fabricating facilities in Russia, Alcoa could be required to make contingent payments of approximately $50 through 2015, but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2013, Alcoa has maximum potential future payments for a guarantee issued on behalf of a third party of $542. This guarantee expires in 2019 and relates to project financing for the aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. In February 2013, a guarantee related to project financing for a hydroelectric power project in Brazil was terminated as the outstanding debt of the consortium was repaid in full. Alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters, outstanding debt, workers compensation, environmental obligations, energy contracts, and customs duties, among others. The total amount committed under these guarantees, which expire at various dates between 2014 and 2022 was $370 at December 31, 2013. Alcoa has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers compensation, energy contracts, and leasing obligations. The total amount committed under these letters of credit, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2014, was $333 at December 31, 2013. Alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters, contract performance, workers compensation, environmental-related matters, and customs duties. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2014, was $170 at December 31, 2013. In March 2012, Alcoa entered into an arrangement with a financial institution to sell certain customer receivables without recourse on a revolving basis. The sale of such receivables is completed through the use of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which is a consolidated subsidiary of Alcoa. This arrangement originally provided for minimum funding of $50 up to a maximum of $250 for receivables sold. In May 2013, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding to $500 and include two additional financial institutions. On March 30, 2012, Alcoa initially sold $304 of customer receivables in exchange for $50 in cash and $254 of deferred purchase price under this arrangement. Alcoa received additional net cash funding of $5 ($388 in draws and $383 in repayments) and $155 ($160 in draws and $5 in repayments) in 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the deferred purchase price receivable was $248 and $18, respectively, which was included in Other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred purchase price receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur; however, as this is a revolving program, the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable. The net change in the deferred purchase price receivable was reflected in the (Increase) decrease in receivables line item on the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. This activity is reflected as an operating cash flow because the related customer receivables are the result of an operating activity with an insignificant, short-term interest rate risk. In 2013 and 2012, the gross cash outflows and inflows associated with the deferred purchase price receivable were $6,985 and $6,755, respectively, and $3,339 and $3,321, respectively. The gross amount of receivables sold and total cash collected under this program since its inception was $10,324 and $9,866, respectively. Alcoa services the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded. Alcoa had three other arrangements, each with a different financial institution, to sell certain customer receivables outright without recourse on a continuous basis. On March 22, 2013, Alcoa terminated these arrangements. All receivables sold under these arrangements were collected as of March 31, 2013. Alcoa serviced the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities; environmental and litigation matters; asset retirement obligations; the testing of 75 Table of Contents goodwill, equity investments, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses to be divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A summary of the Company significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company operating results and financial condition. Derivatives and Hedging. Derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur, future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense. Alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long-term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges. As a result, the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges. The fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales, cost of goods sold, or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge. These contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures, generally not exceeding five years. If no hedging relationship is designated, the derivative is marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions. Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations. 76 Table of Contents Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss. Asset Retirement Obligations. Alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of Alcoa bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting facilities. These AROs consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal, closure of bauxite residue areas, mine reclamation, and landfill closure. Alcoa also recognizes AROs for any significant lease restoration obligation, if required by a lease agreement, and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities. The fair values of these AROs are recorded on a discounted basis, at the time the obligation is incurred, and accreted over time for the change in present value. Additionally, Alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) related to alumina refineries, aluminum smelters, and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date. A CARO is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within Alcoa control. Such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures, maintenance and upgrade programs, and other factors. At the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made, Alcoa would record an ARO for the removal, treatment, transportation, storage and/or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos, underground and aboveground storage tanks, polychlorinated biphenyls, various process residuals, solid wastes, electronic equipment waste, and various other materials. Such amounts may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which they are recorded. If Alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately, the estimated CARO as of December 31, 2013 ranges from less than $1 to $52 per structure (131 structures) in today dollars. Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Alcoa has nine reporting units, of which five are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. The remaining four reporting units are the Alumina segment, the Primary Metals segment, the Global Rolled Products segment, and the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, which is included in Corporate. More than 80% of Alcoa total goodwill is allocated to two reporting units as follows: Alcoa Fastening Systems (AFS) ($1,166) and Alcoa Power and Propulsion (APP) ($1,617) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. These amounts include an allocation of Corporate goodwill. 77 Table of Contents In reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the existing two-step quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. Alcoa policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. Management will proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for a minimum of three reporting units (based on facts and circumstances) during each annual review of goodwill. This policy will result in each of the nine reporting units being subjected to the two-step quantitative impairment test at least once during every three-year period. Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two-step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit. During the 2013 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for two reporting units, the Global Rolled Products segment and one of the five reporting units in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. Management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the two reporting units were less than their carrying values. As such, no further analysis was required. Under the two-step quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Alcoa uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, production costs, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The betas used in calculating the individual reporting units WACC rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts. In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the DCF model is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. The additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill, which may involve the use of valuation experts. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity. During the 2013 annual review of goodwill, management proceeded directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for seven reporting units as follows: the Primary Metals segment, the Alumina segment, the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and four of the five reporting units in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, including 78 Table of Contents AFS and APP. The estimated fair values of the four Engineered Products and Solutions businesses, and the soft alloy extrusions business were substantially in excess of their respective carrying value, resulting in no impairment. During the 2012 annual testing of goodwill, the estimated fair value of the Alumina segment exceeded the carrying value by 7%. In connection with the 2013 testing, the estimated fair value of the Alumina segment exceeded the carrying value by 18%. This increase is attributable to several factors: improved pricing due to the continued implementation of the Alumina Price Index; operating and productivity improvements in the business; and a stronger U.S. dollar, all of which increased management estimates of operating results and cash flows used in assessing Alumina goodwill for impairment. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in the discount rate used in the DCF models. Unfavorable movements in one or more of these trends in the future could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the Alumina segment. For Primary Metals, the estimated fair value as determined by the DCF model was lower than the associated carrying value. As a result, management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of Primary Metals goodwill. The results of the second-step analysis showed that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2013, Alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of $1,731 ($1,719 after noncontrolling interest). As a result of the goodwill impairment, there is no goodwill remaining for the Primary Metals reporting unit. The impairment of Primary Metals goodwill results from several causes: the prolonged economic downturn; a disconnect between industry fundamentals and pricing that has resulted in lower metal prices; and the increased cost of alumina, a key raw material, resulting from expansion of the Alumina Price Index throughout the industry. All of these factors, exacerbated by increases in discount rates, continue to place significant downward pressure on metal prices and operating margins, and the resulting estimated fair value, of the Primary Metals business. As a result, management decreased the near-term and long-term estimates of the operating results and cash flows utilized in assessing Primary Metals goodwill for impairment. The valuation of goodwill for the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is considered a level 3 fair value measurement, which means that the valuation of the assets and liabilities reflect management own judgments regarding the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities. Goodwill impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the Company reporting units and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an impairment test. Equity Investments. Alcoa invests in a number of privately-held companies, primarily through joint ventures and consortia, which are accounted for on the equity method. The equity method is applied in situations where Alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired. The following items are examples of impairment indicators: significant, sustained declines in an investee revenue, earnings, and cash flow trends; adverse market conditions of the investee industry or geographic area; the investee ability to continue operations measured by several items, including liquidity; and other factors. Once an impairment indicator is identified, management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary, in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value. An impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations. Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with 79 Table of Contents fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments. Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality). The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the plans projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors, including finance and banking, consumer products, transportation, insurance, and pharmaceutical, among others. The yield curve model parallels the plans projected cash flows, which have an average duration of 10 years, and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the Company plans obligations multiple times. In 2013, 2012, and 2011, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 4.80%, 4.15%, and 4.90%, respectively. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $460 and either a charge or credit of $21 to after-tax earnings in the following year. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (a four-year average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forward-looking returns by asset class. As it relates to historical asset return information, management focuses on the annual, 10-year moving, and 20-year moving averages when developing this assumption. Management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management own judgment. For 2013, 2012, and 2011, management used 8.50% as its expected long-term rate of return, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. This rate falls within the respective range of the 20-year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class. For 2014, management determined that 8.00% will be the expected long-term rate of return. The decrease of 50 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return is due to a combination of a decrease in the 20-year moving average of actual performance and lower future expected market returns. A change in the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $18 for 2014. In 2013, a net benefit of $876 ($531 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to a 65 basis point increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2012, a net charge of $769 ($529 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to a 75 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses. In 2011, a net charge of $991 ($593 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss, primarily due to an 85 basis point 80 Table of Contents decrease in the discount rate, which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses. Stock-based Compensation. Alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, annual forfeiture rate, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time. Equity grants are issued in January each year. As part of Alcoa stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Compensation expense recorded in 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $71 ($48 after-tax), $67 ($46 after-tax), and $83 ($56 after-tax), respectively. Of this amount, $14, $13, and $18 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees. Most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable. Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Alcoa assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Alcoa experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays. In 2013, Alcoa recognized a $372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in Spain and the U.S. Of this amount, a $237 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets related to a Spanish consolidated tax group. As of December 31, 2013, these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2014 to 2030. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that Alcoa will realize the tax benefit of these deferred tax assets. This was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the Primary Metals business (2013 realized prices were the lowest since 2009) combined with prior year cumulative losses of the Spanish consolidated tax 81 Table of Contents group. The need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, a portion or all of the allowance may be reversed based on changes in facts and circumstances. The remaining $135 relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of available foreign tax credits in the U.S. These credits can be carried forward for 10 years, and, as of December 31, 2013, have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2023. After weighing all available positive and negative evidence, as described above, management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that Alcoa will realize the full tax benefit of these foreign tax credits. This was primarily due to lower foreign sourced taxable income after consideration of tax planning strategies and after the inclusion of earnings from foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends. Similar to the outlook related to Spain above, lower levels of both distributable future foreign earnings and projected foreign sourced taxable income are principally attributable to a decline in the outlook of the Primary Metals business. The need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, an increase or decrease to this allowance may result based on changes in facts and circumstances. Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Related Party Transactions Alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies, consisting of entities in which Alcoa retains a 50% or less equity interest, at negotiated arms-length prices between the two parties. These transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Alcoa for all periods presented.
