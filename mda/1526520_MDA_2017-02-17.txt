Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview TripAdvisor, Inc., by and through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. TripAdvisor, our flagship brand, is the world largest travel site, and its mission is to help people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip. We accomplish this by, among other things, aggregating millions of travelers reviews and opinions about destinations, accommodations, activities and attractions, and restaurants worldwide, thereby creating the foundation for a unique platform that enables users to research and plan their travel experiences. Our platform also enables users to compare real-time pricing and availability for these experiences as well as to book hotels, flights, cruises, vacation rentals, tours, activities and attractions, and restaurants, either on a TripAdvisor site or app, or on the site or app of one of our travel partner sites. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites reached nearly 390 million average monthly unique visitors in our seasonal peak during the year ended December 31, 2016, according to our internal log files. We currently feature 465 million reviews and opinions on 7 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do including 1,060,000 hotels and accommodations and 835,000 vacation rentals, 4.3 million restaurants and 760,000 activities and attractions worldwide. In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, we manage and operate 23 other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing users the most comprehensive travel-planning and trip-taking resources in the travel industry. For additional information about our portfolio of brands and our business model, see the disclosure set forth in Part I, Item 1, Business, under the caption Overview. Our reporting structure includes two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. Our Non-Hotel reportable segment consists of three operating segments, which includes our Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals businesses. The segments are determined based on how the chief operating decision maker regularly assesses information and evaluates performance for operating decision-making purposes, including allocation of resources. Financial information and additional descriptive information related to our segments and geographic information is contained in Note 17 Segment and Geographic Information , in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 and below. Executive Financial Summary and Trends As the largest online travel platform, we believe we are an attractive marketing channel for advertisers including hotel chains, independent hoteliers, OTAs, destination marketing organizations, and other travel-related and non-travel related product and service providers who seek to sell their products and services to our large user base. We are also a booking platform offering users the ability to book hotels, flights, cruises, vacation rentals, tours, activities and attractions, and restaurants directly on our website. The key drivers of our financial results are described below, including a summary of our key financial results, business metrics, and current trends affecting our business, and our segment information. Below are our key financial results and business metrics for the year ended December 31, 2016 (consolidated unless otherwise noted): Financial results Revenue of $1,480 million, a decrease of 1% year over year. Hotel segment revenue of $1,190 million, a decrease of 6% year over year and Non-Hotel segment revenues of $290 million, an increase of 27% year over year. Revenue from North America, EMEA, APAC and LATAM was $830 million, $454 million, $144 million and $52 million, respectively. Total costs and expenses were $1,314 million. 34 Operating income was $166 million. Effective tax rate of 20.5%. Net income of $120 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.82. Operating cash flow was $321 million. Capital expenditures were $72 million. Cash and cash equivalents, and short and long term available-for-sale marketable securities were $746 million as of December 31, 2016. Headcount was 3,327 as of December 31, 2016. Business Metrics Revenue per hotel shopper decreased 15% year over year. Average unique monthly hotel shoppers increased 6% year over year. Current Trends in Our Business Hotel Segment In our hotel segment, we have invested significant time and resources towards enabling users to book hotels on our sites and applications through our instant booking feature. We began with the accelerated rollout in our two largest markets the United States and the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2015, and completed an accelerated and staged global rollout of this feature to all of our markets during the first half of 2016. During the year, the instant booking feature has monetized at a lower revenue per hotel shopper rate than our metasearch feature, and therefore has been dilutive to our TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue growth and to our overall revenue per hotel shopper. However, in the second half of 2016, TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue growth rates improved as we lapped the instant booking rollout in the United States, our largest market, increased spend in our online paid marketing channels, and made product enhancements throughout the year. In addition, the majority of our instant booking revenue is recorded under the consumption model and is recognized at the time the traveler consumes, or completes, the stay. Comparatively, revenue recognized under our metasearch feature is recorded when a traveler makes the click-through to the travel partners websites. In future periods, greater contribution from our instant booking consumption model to TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue could result in additional revenue recognized at the time of a consumed stay and therefore a shift in the timing of our revenue recognition. During 2016, we continued to improve our hotel shopping experience, which included an improved display of our metasearch and instant booking features to hotel shoppers, as well as improving booking transaction acumen, which includes improving the on-site experience by offering the best price value proposition, improving room-level content, optimizing the room selection and booking path, and on-boarding more partners with strong branding and supply channels in order to achieve increased initial and repeat bookings. We have continued to explore and develop additional opportunities to engage users with our booking capabilities through online and offline marketing. We now offer users an end-to-end hotel shopping experience, which we believe has improved the hotel shopping experience, as well as educated users about our more comprehensive offering, which we believe will enable us to drive more conversions of hotel shoppers to bookings, ultimately resulting in higher bookings for our partners and higher revenue per hotel shopper on our platform. In 2016, hotel shopper growth slowed due to a number of factors, including lower revenue per hotel shopper impacting our advertising expenditure, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, a continued intense competitive environment, and other travel market dynamics. One of our key strategic objectives is to grow our brand awareness and grow the number of hotel shoppers on our platforms. We continue to leverage a number of marketing channels, both paid and unpaid, to achieve this objective, including online efforts such as SEM, social media, and email campaigns, as well as offline efforts such as permanent branding campaigns (TripAdvisor-branded travel awards, certificates, stickers and badges). Over time, the traffic visiting our websites and applications from paid marketing 35 channels has generally grown faster than traffic from unpaid sources due to competition from other travel companies and search engines and we may see a continuation of this trend. In 2016, hotel shoppers that visited our websites and applications on mobile phone continued to grow significantly faster than traffic from desktop and tablet devices. As a result, this has contributed to a decline in revenue per hotel shopper and our click-based and transaction revenue, as mobile phone devices monetize significantly less than desktop and tablet. This is due to a number of factors, including the fact that mobile phone is still in the early stages of eCommerce adoption, our partners reduced ability to attribute booking behavior on their websites and applications back to TripAdvisor, limited advertising opportunities on smaller screen devices, lower cost-per-click, lower booking intent, and lower average gross booking value based on consumer purchasing patterns. Mobile phone product development continues to be an area of strategic growth and investment, and we will continue to invest and innovate in this growing platform in order to increase our user base, engagement and monetization over the long term. As a global travel business specializing in discretionary leisure travel, we believe our 2016 hotel shopper growth, revenue per hotel shopper and Hotel segment financial performance also was negatively impacted by macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics, including foreign currency and a number of terrorism events, among other factors. Non-Hotel Segment TripAdvisor end-to-end user experience extends beyond our hotel business. In 2016, unique monthly users to non-hotel pages on our websites and applications including attractions, restaurants, and vacation rentals continued to grow. In efforts to address this growing demand and engagement with these products we have strategically invested in improving the user experience on all devices as well as in building our inventory of global supply of bookable attractions, restaurants, and vacation rentals. In addition to achieving strong supply growth, during 2016 we drove increased mobile engagement and mobile bookings with new mobile ticketing capabilities and mobile push notifications, including in-destination suggestions on the best things to do, helpful tips on the best nearby restaurants, and popular dish recommendations. Continued successful execution of our key growth strategies resulted in 27% revenue growth in this segment in 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. Increasing traffic to and engagement with our Non-Hotel business, as well as increasing our global supply to offer users more choice are ongoing strategic objectives. 36 Results of Operations Selected Financial Data (in millions, except per share data and percentages) Year ended December 31, % Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 Revenue $ 1,480 $ 1,492 $ 1,246 (1 )% 20 % Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue 71 58 40 22 % 45 % Selling and marketing 756 692 502 9 % 38 % Technology and content 243 207 171 17 % 21 % General and administrative 143 210 128 (32 )% 64 % Depreciation 69 57 47 21 % 21 % Amortization of intangible assets 32 36 18 (11 )% 100 % Total costs and expenses 1,314 1,260 906 4 % 39 % Operating income 166 232 340 (28 )% (32 )% Other income (expense): Interest expense (12 ) (10 ) (9 ) 20 % 11 % Interest income and other, net (3 ) 17 (9 ) 118 % (289 )% Total other income (expense), net (15 ) 7 (18 ) 314 % (139 )% Income before income taxes 151 239 322 (37 )% (26 )% Provision for income taxes (31 ) (41 ) (96 ) (24 )% (57 )% Net income $ 120 $ 198 $ 226 (39 )% (12 )% Earnings per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic $ 0.83 $ 1.38 $ 1.58 (40 )% (13 )% Diluted $ 0.82 $ 1.36 $ 1.55 (40 )% (12 )% Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 145 144 143 1 % 1 % Diluted 147 146 146 1 % 0 % Other financial data: Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 352 $ 466 $ 468 (24 )% 0 % (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. See Adjusted EBITDA discussion below for more information. 37 Consolidated Revenue and Segments Revenue and Segment Information In the first quarter of 2016 we began providing additional disclosure on our revenue sources within our Hotel segment, which are TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue, TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue, and other hotel revenue. The purpose of this additional disclosure is to provide further understanding of our hotel revenue sources and allow for additional insight into the calculation of one of our key operating performance metrics, revenue per hotel shopper. In conjunction with providing these additional revenue disclosures, we will no longer provide our historically reported revenue disclosure of click-based advertising, display-based advertising, and subscription, transaction and other revenues. This change had no effect on our consolidated financial statements in any period or with the composition of our operating or reportable segments. Year ended December 31, % Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 Revenue by Segment: (in millions) Hotel $ 1,190 $ 1,263 $ 1,135 (6 )% 11 % Non-Hotel 290 229 111 27 % 106 % Total revenue $ 1,480 $ 1,492 $ 1,246 (1 )% 20 % Adjusted EBITDA by Segment (1) : Hotel $ 380 $ 472 $ 472 (19 )% 0 % Non-Hotel (28 ) (6 ) (4 ) (367 )% (50 )% Adjusted EBITDA Margin by Segment (2) : Hotel 32 % 37 % 42 % Non-Hotel (10 )% (3 )% (4 )% (1) Included in Adjusted EBITDA is a general and administrative expense allocation for each segment, which is based on the segment percentage of our total personnel costs, excluding stock-based compensation. See Note 17 Segment and Geographic Information , in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, for the periods presented above. (2) We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin by Segment , as Adjusted EBITDA by segment divided by revenue by segment. Hotel Segment Our Hotel segment revenue decreased $73 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a $87 million decrease in TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue, which is primarily due to a decline in revenue per hotel shopper of 15%, partially offset by a 6% increase in average unique monthly hotel shoppers, partially offset by growth of $10 million in TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue, and $4 million in other hotel revenue. Our Hotel segment revenue increased $128 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to a $73 million increase in TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue, which is primarily due to an increase in average unique monthly hotel shoppers of 15% partially offset by a 4% decrease in revenue per hotel shopper, a $39 million increase in TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue, and $16 million increase in other hotel revenue. See below for discussion of these revenue sources within our Hotel segment. Adjusted EBITDA in our Hotel segment decreased $92 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in Hotel segment revenue and increased operating costs, primarily driven by an increase in online traffic acquisition costs, partially offset by lower television advertising costs due to the cessation of our television advertising campaign in 2016. Our Hotel segment adjusted EBITDA margin also decelerated during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to an overall decrease in Hotel segment revenue, and to a lesser extent an increase in operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA in our Hotel Segment was flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, due to an increase in revenue, offset by increased operating costs, primarily driven by increased personnel and overhead costs, online traffic acquisition costs, and television advertising. Our Hotel 38 segment adjusted EBITDA margin also decelerated during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the deceleration in revenue growth year over year. The following is a detailed discussion of the revenue sources within our Hotel segment: Year ended December 31, % Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015 2015 vs 2014 Hotel: (in millions) TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction $ 750 $ 837 $ 764 (10 %) 10 % TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and Subscription 282 272 233 4 % 17 % Other hotel revenue 158 154 138 3 % 12 % Total Hotel revenue $ 1,190 $ 1,263 $ 1,135 (6 %) 11 % TripAdvisor-branded Click-based and Transaction Revenue TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue includes click-based advertising revenue (or revenue derived from our metasearch auction) from our TripAdvisor-branded websites and revenue from our transaction-based instant booking feature. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 63%, 66% and 67%, respectively, of our total Hotel segment revenue was derived from our TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue. TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue decreased $87 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decline of 15% in revenue per hotel shopper, offset by an increase in average monthly unique hotel shoppers of 6% during the year ended December 31, 2016. TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue increased $73 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to an increase in average monthly unique hotel shoppers of 15%, offset by a decline of 4% in revenue per hotel shopper during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our largest source of Hotel segment revenue is click-based advertising revenue from our TripAdvisor-branded websites, which includes links to our partners sites and contextually-relevant branded and related text links. Click-based advertising is generated primarily through our metasearch auction, a description of which follows. Our click-based advertising partners are predominantly OTAs, and direct suppliers in the hotel product category. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or CPC , basis, with payments from advertisers based on the number of users who click on each type of link, or in other words a conversion of a hotel shopper to a paid click. CPC is the price that partners are willing to pay for a hotel shopper lead, and is determined in a competitive process that enables our partners to use our proprietary, automated bidding system to submit CPC bids to have their rates and availability listed on our site. This process is called our metasearch auction. When a partner submits a CPC bid, they are agreeing to pay the amount of that bid each time a user subsequently clicks on the link to the partner website. Bids can be submitted periodically as often as daily on a property-by-property basis. The size of the bid relative to other bids received is the primary factor used to determine the placement of partner links on our site, including on hotel comparison search results and on property detail pages. CPCs are generally lower in markets outside the U.S., than in the U.S. market, and, in addition, hotel shoppers visiting via mobile phones currently monetize at a significantly lower rate than hotel shoppers visiting via desktop or tablet. Our transaction revenue is comprised of revenue from our instant booking feature, which enables the merchant of record, generally an OTA or hotel partner, to pay a commission to TripAdvisor for a user that completes a hotel reservation on our website. Instant booking revenue is currently recognized under two different models: the transaction model and the consumption model. Our transaction model commission revenue is recorded at the time a traveler books a hotel reservation on our site with one of our transaction partners. Our transaction partners are liable for commission payments to us upon booking and the partner assumes the cancellation risk. When a traveler makes a hotel reservation on our site with one of our consumption partners, which comprises the majority of our instant booking revenue, revenue is not recorded until the traveler completes the stay as our consumption partners are liable for commission payment only upon the completion of stay by the traveler. OTA and hotel partner placement, as well as comparative hotel prices available to the traveler in the booking process under both models, are determined 39 by a bidding process within our proprietary automated bidding system, based on a number of variables, primarily hotel room prices, but also including other factors, such as conversion rates and commission rates, depending on the specific hotel selected. Instant booking commissions are primarily a function of average gross booking value generated from hotel reservations, cancellation rates experienced, and commission rates negotiated with each of our partners. The key drivers of TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue include the growth in average monthly unique hotel shoppers and, in particular, revenue per hotel shopper, which measures how effectively we convert our hotel shoppers into revenue. We measure performance by calculating revenue per hotel shopper on an aggregate basis, dividing total TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue by total average monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor-branded websites for the periods presented. While we believe total traffic growth, or growth in monthly visits from unique visitors, is reflective of our overall brand growth, we also track and analyze sub-segments of our traffic and their correlation to revenue generation and utilize data regarding hotel shoppers as a key indicator of revenue growth. Hotel shoppers are visitors who view either a listing of hotels in a city or a specific hotel page. The number of hotel shoppers tends to vary based on seasonality of the travel industry and general economic conditions, as well as other factors outside of our control. Given these factors, as well as the trend towards increased usage on mobile phones and international expansion, quarterly and annual hotel shopper growth is a difficult metric to forecast. Our aggregate average monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor-branded websites increased by 6% and 15%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, when compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014, according to our log files. The increase in hotel shoppers for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was primarily due to growth in our paid online marketing channels as well as the general trend of an increasing number of hotel shoppers visiting our websites and apps on mobile phones, which has grown significantly faster than traffic from desktop and tablet devices during these periods. Our average monthly unique hotel shopper growth rate decelerated during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, due to the dilutive effects from the global launch of our instant booking product feature, which impacted 2016 to a greater extent than 2015 due to the timing of the staged rollout, increased competition, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including foreign currency and a number of terrorism events, among other factors. While increasing the absolute number of hotel shoppers on our sites remains a top strategic priority, our ability to grow through paid traffic channels has been negatively impacted by lower revenue per hotel shopper. The below table summarizes our revenue per hotel shopper calculation and growth rate, in aggregate, for the periods presented: Year ended December 31, % Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015 2015 vs 2014 (in millions) Revenue per hotel shopper: TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue $ 750 $ 837 $ 764 (10 %) 10 % Divided by: Total average unique monthly hotel shoppers for the year 1,645 1,555 1,357 6 % 15 % $ 0.46 $ 0.54 $ 0.56 (15 %) (4 %) Our overall revenue per hotel shopper decreased 15% and 4%, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014, according to our log files. We believe the primary drivers of this decrease include the dilutive effects from our global launch of our instant booking product feature, which impacted 2016 to a greater extent than 2015 due to the timing of the staged rollout, a greater percentage of hotel shoppers visiting TripAdvisor websites and apps via mobile phones, in addition to, challenging metasearch comparatives in early 2016 relative to the same periods in 2015, increased competition, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including foreign currency and a number of terrorism events, among other factors. 40 TripAdvisor-branded Display-based Advertising and Subscription Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 24%, 22% and 21%, respectively, of our Hotel segment revenue was derived from our TripAdvisor-branded display based advertising and subscription revenue, which primarily consists of revenue from display-based advertising and subscription-based hotel advertising revenue (or Business Advantage, formerly Business Listings). Our TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue increased by $10 million or 4%, and $39 million or 17%, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014. Display-based advertising revenue and subscription revenue each grew at comparable rates during these periods. 2016 vs. 2015 The increase in display-based advertising revenue was primarily due to a slight increase in pricing, as well as impressions sold during the year, while the increase in subscription revenue was a result of increased sales productivity in 2015 which also benefitted 2016, as well as increased pricing and improvements in customer retention rates. The display-based advertising and subscription revenue growth rate decelerated during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the decline in the number of impressions sold for display-based advertising and lower sales productivity in 2016 for subscription revenue. 2015 vs. 2014 The increase in display-based advertising revenue was a result of an increase in the number of impressions sold, due to increased sales productivity, as well as increased sellable inventory due to traffic growth and introduction of new products and features, partially offset by a slight decrease in pricing, while the increase in subscription revenue was primarily related to increased sales productivity. Other Hotel Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 13%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of our Hotel segment revenue was derived from other hotel revenues. Our other hotel revenue primarily includes revenue from non-TripAdvisor branded websites, such as smartertravel.com, independenttraveler.com, and bookingbuddy.com, including click-based advertising revenue, display-based advertising revenue and room reservations sold through these websites. Our other hotel revenue increased by $4 million and $16 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014. Non-Hotel Segment For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our Non-Hotel segment revenue accounted for 20%, 15% and 9%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenue. Our Non-Hotel segment revenue increased by $61 million or 27%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by increased bookings in 2016 and 2015 across all businesses. Our Attractions business benefitted in 2016 from an increase in supply of attraction listings and attraction partners, continued growth in our user base globally, and enhanced user experience from the introduction of new features, such as attractions on instant booking for mobile, which enables users to purchase tickets and tours seamlessly without leaving the mobile app. These factors are all contributing to more consumer choice, increased conversion, and continued revenue growth as a result of increased bookings. In our Restaurants business, we have experienced continued revenue growth due to increased bookings in our more established markets and additionally from expansion into new markets. In our Vacation Rentals business we continued to see an increase in property listings, as well as increased revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to continued growth in our free-to-list model and increased bookings during the year. Our Non-Hotel segment revenue increased $118 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. This was driven by growth in our Vacation Rentals business, primarily due to growth in our free-to-list commission-based booking model, and $96 million in incremental revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, when compared to the same period in 2014, related to our Attractions and Restaurants businesses, which Viator and Lafourchette were acquired in August 2014 and May 2014, respectively. 41 Adjusted EBITDA in our Non-Hotel segment decreased $22 million and $2 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2015 and 2014. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased personnel and overhead costs of $47 million, in addition to increased online traffic acquisition costs and merchant credit card and transaction fees, which more than offset the increase in revenue. Adjusted EBITDA in our Non-Hotel Segment was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014. The Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals businesses are all at the earlier stages of their growth and business life cycle which require early investment to fund growth initiatives, such as additional personnel, and a contributing factor to this reportable segment operating at a loss for the periods presented. Revenue by Geography The following table presents our revenue by geographic region. Revenue by geography is based on the geographic location of our websites: Year ended December 31, % Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015 2015 vs 2014 (in millions) Revenue by geographic region: North America (1) $ 830 $ 775 $ 629 7 % 23 % EMEA (2) 454 473 405 (4 %) 17 % APAC (3) 144 172 156 (16 %) 10 % LATAM (4) 52 72 56 (28 %) 29 % Total $ 1,480 $ 1,492 $ 1,246 (1 %) 20 % (1) United States and Canada (2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (3) Asia-Pacific (4) Latin America Revenue outside of North America, or international revenue, decreased $67 million or 9% during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015 and increased $100 million or 16% during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared to the same period in 2014. International revenue represented 44%, 48%, and 50% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Our international revenue growth rate decelerated during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the overall decrease in revenue per hotel shopper, which is explained above. Our international revenue also declined as a percentage of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. We believe this was largely due to the timing of our instant booking feature rollout in international markets during the first half of this year, and its associated dilutive impact to TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue, as compared to the rollout in our U.S market, which was completed in the third quarter of 2015, and to a lesser extent the negative impact to total revenue from the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates. Although international revenue increased, our international revenue growth rate slowed and international revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, declined slightly during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, specifically the prolonged weakness of the Euro, in addition to our accelerated rollout of instant booking in the U.K. in the third quarter of 2015, which had a dilutive impact on international revenue in 2015. In addition, our international hotel shoppers have generally monetized at lower revenue per hotel shopper rates than hotel shoppers in the U.S. market for all periods presented. 42 Consolidated Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of expenses that are directly related or closely correlated to revenue generation, including direct costs, such as ad serving fees, flight search fees, credit card fees and other transaction costs, and data center costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses for certain customer support personnel who are directly involved in revenue generation.

Our Attractions and Restaurants businesses, which Viator and Lafourchette were acquired in August 2014 and May 2014, respectively, added an incremental $15 million to our cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, of which an incremental $6 million was related to personnel and overhead. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of direct costs, including traffic generation costs from SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, syndication costs and affiliate program commissions, social media costs, brand advertising, television and other offline advertising, and public relations. In addition, our indirect sales and marketing expense consists of personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support and marketing employees.

We spent $51 million on our television advertising campaign during the year ended December 31, 2015 in our Hotel segment, which we did not incur during the year ended December 31, 2016. Personnel and overhead costs increased $24 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in headcount in our Non-Hotel segment, which was needed to support business growth. 2015 vs. 2014 Direct selling and marketing costs increased $167 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to increased SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs and increased costs related to our television campaign.

Personnel and overhead costs increased $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to incremental personnel costs related to our 2014 business acquisitions in Attractions (Viator purchased in August 2014) and Restaurants (Lafourchette acquired in May 2014). Our Attraction and Restaurant businesses added an incremental $68 million to our selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, of which an incremental $20 million was related to personnel and overhead, with the remaining incremental costs primarily related to SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs. Technology and Content Technology and content expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses for salaried employees and contractors engaged in the design, development, testing, content support, and maintenance of our websites and mobile apps.

Our Attractions and Restaurants businesses added an incremental 44 $15 million to our technology and content expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, of which an incremental $9 million was related to personnel and overhead. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs, including personnel engaged in executive leadership, finance, legal, and human resources, including stock-based compensation. General and administrative costs also include professional service fees and other fees including audit, legal, tax and accounting, and other costs including bad debt expense, non-income taxes and charitable contributions.

Professional service fees and other also decreased $62 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a non-cash charitable contribution of $67 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, discussed below, which did not reoccur in 2016, partially offset by increased consulting costs, non-income taxes, and bad debt expense. 2015 vs. 2014 General and administrative costs increased $82 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions of $59 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a $67 million non-cash charitable contribution to settle our pledge obligation to the TripAdvisor Charitable Foundation, while we recorded a charitable contribution of $8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, which was settled in cash. See Note 17 Segments and Geographic Information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information. Personnel costs and overhead costs also increased $19 million, which was related to an increase in headcount to support our business operations, as well as incremental personnel costs related to our 2014 business acquisitions in Attractions (Viator purchased in August 2014) and Restaurants (Lafourchette acquired in May 2014). Our Attractions and Restaurants businesses added an incremental $11 million to our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, of which an incremental $8 million was related to personnel and overhead. Depreciation Depreciation expense consists of depreciation on computer equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture, office equipment and other assets, our corporate headquarters building and amortization of capitalized software and website development costs. Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Depreciation $ 69 $ 57 $ 47 % of revenue 4.7 % 3.8 % 3.8 % 45 Depreciation expense increased $12 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to increased amortization related to capitalized software and website development costs of $9 million and incremental depreciation on our corporate headquarters building of $1 million. Depreciation expense increased $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to increased amortization related to capitalized software and website development costs of $7 million and incremental depreciation on our corporate headquarters building of $2 million. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our corporate headquarters asset. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization consists of the amortization of purchased definite-lived intangibles.

Amortization of intangible assets increased $18 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to incremental amortization from purchased definite lived intangibles related to our 2014 business acquisitions. Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions and Dispositions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our acquisitions. Interest Expense Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred, commitment fees and debt issuance cost amortization related to our 2011 Credit Facility, 2015 Credit Facility, 2016 Credit Facility, and Chinese Credit Facilities, as well as interest on our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters. Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Interest expense $ (12 ) $ (10 ) $ (9 ) Interest expense increased $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase of $3 million in interest imputed on our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters lease in 2016, partially offset by a decrease in interest incurred due to lower average outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense increased $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to interest imputed on our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters lease of approximately $4 million in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in interest incurred due to lower average outstanding borrowings during 2015. Refer to Note 9 Debt and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our outstanding borrowing facilities and our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters, respectively. 46 Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net primarily consists of interest earned and amortization of discounts and premiums on our marketable securities, net foreign currency exchange gains and losses, and gains and losses on sales of our marketable securities and sale of businesses. Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Interest income and other, net $ (3 ) $ 17 $ (9 ) 2016 vs. 2015 Interest income and other, net decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a $20 million gain from sale of business of one of our Chinese subsidiaries in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016. 2015 vs. 2014 Interest income and other, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, when compared to the same periods in 2014, primarily due to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates and a $20 million gain from the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries during 2015. Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions and Dispositions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on the sale of this business. Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 31 $ 41 $ 96 Effective tax rate 20.5 % 17.2 % 29.8 % Our effective tax rate is generally less than the federal statutory rate in the United States primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, where our effective tax rate is lower. This is partly driven by a statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom of 20% and our tax incentive of 5% tax rate on qualifying income in Singapore granted by the Singapore Economic Development Board in 2011. This incentive provides for a reduced tax rate on qualifying income of 5% as compared to Singapore statutory tax rate of 17% and is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds, which the Company has met through 2016. Our effective tax rate is partially offset by state income taxes, non-deductible stock compensation and accruals on uncertain tax positions. 2016 vs. 2015 Our effective tax rate increased to 20.5% during the year ended December 31, 2016 from 17.2% in the same period in 2015. The change in the effective tax rate for 2016 compared to the 2015 rate was primarily due to a change in jurisdictional earnings, which includes a non-cash charitable contribution during the year ended December 31, 2015, which did not reoccur in 2016, and the recognition of prior year tax benefits in response to a recent U.S. Tax Court ruling in regards to Altera Corporation on the treatment of stock-based compensation in cost-sharing arrangements, both of which are discussed below. 2015 vs. 2014 Our effective tax rate decreased to 17.2% during the year ended December 31, 2015 from 29.8% in the same period in 2014. The change in the effective tax rate for 2015 compared to the 2014 rate was primarily due to a change in jurisdictional earnings, which includes an incremental $59 million of expense related to charitable contributions in the U.S. during 2015, and the recognition of a tax benefit of $13 million in response to a recent U.S. 47 Tax Court ruling in regards to Altera Corporation on the treatment of stock-based compensation in cost-sharing arrangements. Refer to Note 10 Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion regarding the Altera Corporation court ruling. The decline in our effective tax rate was also partly driven by a decrease in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom from 21% to 20% in 2015 Adjusted EBITDA To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure refers to a numerical measure of a company historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company financial statements. Adjusted EBITDA is our segment profit measure and a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the operating performance of our business and on which internal budgets and forecasts are based and approved. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: (1) provision for income taxes; (2) other income (expense), net; (3) depreciation of property and equipment, including amortization of internal use software and website development; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) stock-based compensation and other stock-settled obligations; (6) goodwill, long-lived asset and intangible asset impairments; and (7) other non-recurring expenses and income. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation or other stock-settled obligations; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented above. 48 Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Net income $ 120 $ 198 $ 226 Provision for income taxes 31 41 96 Other expense (income), net 15 (7 ) 18 Other non-recurring expenses - 2 - Non-cash charitable contribution (1) - 67 - Stock-based compensation 85 72 63 Amortization of intangible assets 32 36 18 Depreciation 69 57 47 Adjusted EBITDA $ 352 $ 466 $ 468 (1) During the fourth quarter of 2015, we incurred an expense in the amount of $67 million to reflect a non-cash contribution to The TripAdvisor Charitable Foundation (the Foundation ), which was recorded to general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations. We settled this obligation in treasury shares based on the fair value of our common stock on the date the shares were issued to the Foundation. Given the use of stock to settle the obligation, the amount has been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. TripAdvisor does not expect to make any future contributions to the Foundation. Refer to Note 17 Segments and Geographic Information for a discussion of this charitable contribution. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following section explains how we have generated and used our cash historically, describes our current capital resources and discusses our future known financial commitments. Sources and Uses of Cash Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 321 $ 418 $ 407 Investing activities (163 ) (58 ) (233 ) Financing activities (143 ) (189 ) (61 ) Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows generated from operations, although liquidity needs can also be met through drawdowns under our 2015 Credit Facility, 2016 Credit Facility and Chinese Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $746 million and $698 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term available-for-sale marketable securities. As of December 31, 2016 approximately $476 million of our cash, cash equivalents and all, or $134 million of short and long-term available-for-sale marketable securities, were held by our international subsidiaries, primarily in the United Kingdom. Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States totaled approximately $828 million as of December 31, 2016. Should we distribute, or be treated under certain U.S. tax rules as having distributed, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes. To date, we have permanently reinvested our foreign earnings outside of the United States and we currently do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund U.S. operations. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is not practicable because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation. The majority of cash on hand is denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $91 million in long-term debt, within our U.S subsidiaries, and approximately $906 million of borrowing capacity available under our 2015 Credit Facility, which we are currently borrowing under a one-month interest period at 2.0% per annum, which will reset periodically. In 49 addition, we had outstanding borrowings of $73 million in short-term debt, within our subsidiaries outside the U.S., and no additional borrowing capacity available under our 2016 Credit Facility, which we are currently borrowing under a one-month interest period at 1.9% per annum, which will also reset periodically. Finally, as of December 31, 2016, we had current borrowings of $7 million and approximately $33 million of available borrowing capacity under our Chinese Credit Facilities, which currently bear interest at a rate based on 100% of the People Bank of China base rate, or 4.35%. For further discussion on our credit facilities, see below, and also refer to Note 9 Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Historically, the cash we generate from operations has been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to meet our long term debt obligations and other financial commitments. Management believes that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities, combined with expected cash flows generated by operating activities and available cash from our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our ongoing working capital requirements, capital expenditures and business growth initiatives; meet our long term debt obligations, lease commitments and other financial commitments; and fund any potential share repurchases or potential acquisitions for at least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital, including refinancing or incurring additional debt, when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business growth initiatives, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. 2016 vs. 2015 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $97 million or 23% when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net income of $78 million and a decrease in working capital movements of $11 million, primarily due to the timing of vendor payments, income tax payments, and collection of receivables, as well as a lower income tax provision in 2016. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities increased by $105 million when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a net increase in cash used for the purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable securities of $103 million, net proceeds from the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries of $25 million in 2015 which did not reoccur in 2016, and a net increase in cash paid for business acquisitions and other investments of $14 million, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $37 million, primarily related to the completion of our corporate headquarters building in mid-2015. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities decreased by $46 million when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to: (i) a repayment of our 2011 credit facility of $300 million in 2015, (ii) a decrease in borrowings of $186 million in 2016 from our 2015 Credit Facility, (iii) incremental borrowings of $3 million and a decrease in repayments of $40 million in 2016 on our Chinese Credit Facilities, (iv) a decrease in tax withholding payments of $58 million and cash received for stock option exercises of $5 million in 2016 primarily related to a decrease in the number of stock options exercised and lower average stock price in 2016, and (v) borrowings on our 2016 Credit Facility of $73 million in 2016; partially offset by (i) an increase in repayments of $120 million in 2016 related to our 2015 Credit Facility, (ii) payments of $105 million for common stock share repurchases under our authorized share repurchase program in 2016, and (iii) $12 million in lease incentive payments received related to our corporate headquarters in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016. 50 2015 vs. 2014 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $11 million or 3% when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily driven by an increase in non-cash items affecting cash flows of $55 million, which is primarily due to an increase in the following items: stock-based compensation; depreciation; amortization of intangibles; and charitable contributions, partially offset by deferred tax benefits and gain on sale of a business, all of which was partially offset by a decrease in net income of $28 million and working capital movements of $16 million. The decrease in working capital movements of $16 million was primarily related to an overall lower income tax provision for 2015, partially offset by an increase in operating cash flow from deferred merchant payables. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $175 million when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to a net decrease in cash paid for business acquisitions of $302 million and net proceeds from the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries of $25 million in 2015, partially offset by a net increase in cash used for the purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable securities of $125 million, and an increase in capital expenditures of $28 million, primarily driven by expenditures on our corporate headquarters. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities increased by $128 million when compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the repayment of our Term Loan of $300 million in 2015, or an incremental outflow of $260 million, partial repayment of our outstanding borrowings related to our 2015 Credit Facility of $90 million, incremental repayments of our outstanding borrowings related to our Chinese Credit Facilities of $38 million, and an increase in tax withholding payments of $40 million primarily related to increased exercises of stock options, partially offset by net borrowings on our 2015 Credit Facility of $287 million, and receipts of $12 million in lease incentive payments related to our corporate headquarters building financing obligation. Cash Requirements The following table aggregates our material contractual obligations and minimum commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016: By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years (in millions) 2015 Credit Facility, 2016 Credit Facility, and Chinese Credit Facilities (1) $ 171 $ 80 $ $ 91 $ Expected interest payments on 2015 Credit Facility (2) 7 2 4 1 Expected commitment fee payments on 2015 Credit Facility (3) 7 2 4 1 Property leases, net of sublease income (4) 248 25 51 52 120 Total (5)(6) $ 433 $ 109 $ 59 $ 145 $ 120 (1) Debt repayment amounts assume that our existing debt under our 2015 Credit Facility is repaid at the end of the credit agreement and do not assume additional borrowings or refinancing of existing debt. See Note 9 Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our 2015 Credit Facility, 2016 Credit Facility, and Chinese Credit Facilities. (2) The amounts included as expected interest payments in this table are based on the effective interest rate as of December 31, 2016, but, could change significantly in the future. Amounts assume that our existing debt is 51 repaid at the end of the credit agreement and do not assume additional borrowings or refinancing of existing debt. (3) The amounts included as expected commitment fee payments in this table are based on the unused portion of credit facility, issued letters of credit, and current effective commitment fee rate as of December 31, 2016, however, these variables could change significantly in the future. (4) Estimated future minimum rental payments under operating leases with non-cancelable lease terms, including our corporate headquarters lease in Needham, MA. See discussion under Office Lease Commitments below. (5) Excluded from the table was $108 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, that we have recorded in other long-term liabilities for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. We do not anticipate any material changes in the next year. (6) Excluded from the table was $3 million of undrawn standby letters of credit, related to our property leases. 2015 Credit Facility On June 26, 2015, we entered into a five year credit agreement (the 2015 Credit Facility ) with a group of lenders and immediately borrowed $290 million, which was used to repay all outstanding borrowings pursuant to the 2011 Credit Facility (as described in Note 9 Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). The 2015 Credit Facility, among other things, provides for (i) a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, (ii) an interest rate on borrowings and commitment fees based on the Company and its subsidiaries consolidated leverage ratio; and (iii) uncommitted incremental revolving loan and term loan facilities, subject to compliance with a leverage covenant and other conditions. Any overdue amounts under or in respect of the 2015 Credit Facility not paid when due shall bear interest at (i) in the case of principal, the applicable interest rate plus 2.00% per annum, (ii) in the case of interest denominated in Sterling or Euro, the applicable rate plus 2.00% per annum; and (iii) in the case of interest denominated in US dollars, 2.00% per annum plus the Alternate Base Rate plus the interest rate spread applicable to ABR loans. The Company may borrow from the 2015 Credit Facility in U.S dollars, Euros and British pound sterling with a term of five years expiring June 26, 2020. There is no specific repayment date prior to the end of the five-year agreement for our outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $101 million and repaid $210 million of our outstanding borrowings on the 2015 Credit Facility. Based on the Company current leverage ratio, our borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points, or the Eurocurrency Spread. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $91 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility and was borrowing under a one-month interest period of 2.0% per annum, which was determined using a one-month interest period Eurocurrency Spread, which will reset periodically. Interest will be payable on a monthly basis while the Company is borrowing under the one-month interest rate period. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, on the daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility for each fiscal quarter and fees in connection with the issuance of letters of credit. Unused revolver capacity is currently subject to a commitment fee of 20.0 basis points, given the Company current leverage ratio. The 2015 Credit Facility includes $15 million of borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and $40 million for borrowings on same-day notice. As of December 30, 2016, we had issued $3 million of outstanding letters of credit under the 2015 Credit Facility. We may voluntarily repay any outstanding borrowing under the 2015 Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to Eurocurrency loans. Certain wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company have agreed to guarantee the Company obligations under the 2015 Credit Facility. The 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends and distributions, make investments, loans or advances, prepay certain subordinated indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend material agreements governing certain subordinated indebtedness, and change our fiscal year. The 2015 Credit Facility also requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the 2015 Credit Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of all amounts due under 2015 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 52 2016 Credit Facility On September 7, 2016, we entered into an uncommitted facility agreement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited (the Lender ), which provides for a $73 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2016 Credit Facility ) with no specific expiration date. The 2016 Credit Facility is available at the Lender absolute discretion and can be canceled at any time. Repayment terms for borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility are generally one to six month periods and bear interest at LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points. The Company may borrow from the 2016 Credit Facility in U.S dollars only and we may voluntarily repay any outstanding borrowing at any time without premium or penalty. Any overdue amounts under or in respect of the 2016 Credit Facility not paid when due shall bear interest in the case of principal at the applicable interest rate plus 1.50% per annum. In connection with the 2016 Credit Facility, any lender fees and debt financing costs paid were not material. In addition, TripAdvisor, LLC, a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of the Company, has agreed to guarantee the Company obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility. There are no specific financial or incurrence covenants. We borrowed $73 million from this uncommitted credit facility in September 2016. These funds were used for general working capital needs of the Company, primarily for partial repayment of our long term debt, and the liability is recorded in short-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. The Company was borrowing under a one-month interest period of 1.9% per annum at December 31, 2016, which will reset periodically. Interest will be payable on a monthly basis while the Company is borrowing under the one-month interest rate period. Chinese Credit Facilities In addition to our borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility and 2016 Credit Facility, we maintain two credit facilities in China (jointly, the Chinese Credit Facilities ). As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had short-term borrowings outstanding of $7 million and $1 million, respectively. We are parties to a $30 million, one-year revolving credit facility with Bank of America (the Chinese Credit Facility BOA ) that is currently subject to review on a periodic basis with no specific expiration period. Our Chinese Credit Facility BOA currently bears interest at a rate based on 100% of the People Bank of China base rate, which was 4.35% as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, there are no outstanding borrowings under the Chinese Credit Facility BOA. We are also parties to a RMB 70,000,000 (approximately $10 million), one-year revolving credit facility with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( Chinese Credit Facility JPM ) which was reduced from RMB 125,000,000 (approximately $18 million) during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our Chinese Credit Facility JPM currently bears interest at a rate based on 100% of the People Bank of China base rate, which was 4.35% as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had $7 million of outstanding borrowings from the Chinese Credit Facility JPM. Office Lease Commitments In June 2013, TripAdvisor LLC ( TA LLC ), our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a lease, for a new corporate headquarters (the Lease ). Pursuant to the Lease, the landlord built an approximately 280,000 square foot rental building in Needham, Massachusetts (the Premises ), and leased the Premises to TA LLC as our new corporate headquarters for an initial term of 15 years and 7 months or through December 2030. TA LLC also has an option to extend the term of the Lease for two consecutive terms of five years each. Because we were involved in the construction project and were responsible for paying a portion of the costs of normal finish work and structural elements of the Premises, the Company was deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the Premises during the construction period under build to suit lease accounting guidance under GAAP. Therefore, the Company recorded project construction costs during the construction period incurred by the landlord as a construction-in-progress asset and a related construction financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. The amounts that the Company has paid or incurred for normal tenant improvements and structural improvements had also been recorded to the construction-in-progress asset. 53 Upon completion of construction at end of the second quarter of 2015, we evaluated the construction-in-progress asset and construction financing obligation for de-recognition under the criteria for sale-leaseback treatment under GAAP. We concluded that we have forms of continued economic involvement in the facility, and therefore did not meet the provisions for sale-leaseback accounting. This determination was based on the Company's continuing involvement with the property in the form of non-recourse financing to the lessor. Therefore, the Lease is accounted for as a financing obligation. Accordingly, we began depreciating the building asset over its estimated useful life and incurring interest expense related to the financing obligation imputed using the effective interest rate method. We bifurcate our lease payments pursuant to the Premises into: (i) a portion that is allocated to the building (a reduction to the financing obligation) and; (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the building was constructed. The portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease that commenced in 2013. The financing obligation is considered a long-term finance lease obligation and is recorded to long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. At the end of the lease term, the carrying value of the building asset and the remaining financing obligation are expected to be equal, at which time we may either surrender the leased asset as settlement of the remaining financing obligation or extend the initial term of the lease for the continued use of the asset. In the years ended December 31 2016, 2015, and 2014, the Company recorded $7 million, $4 million, and $0 million of interest expense, respectively, $3 million, $2 million, and $0 million of depreciation expense, respectively, and $2 million, $1 million, $1 million, of rent expense in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of operations, respectively, related to the Premises. We also lease an aggregate of approximately 465,000 square feet at approximately 40 other locations across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, in cities such as, New York, Boston, London, Sydney, Barcelona, Paris, and Beijing, primarily for our sales offices, subsidiary headquarters, and international management teams, pursuant to leases with various expiration dates, with the latest expiring in June 2027. As of December 31, 2016, future minimum commitments under our corporate headquarters lease and other non-cancelable operating leases for office space with terms of more than one year and contractual sublease income were as follows: Year Corporate Headquarters Lease (1) Other Operating Leases Sublease Income Total Lease Commitments (Net of Sublease Income) (in millions) 2017 $ 9 $ 17 $ (1 ) $ 25 2018 9 17 (1 ) 25 2019 9 18 (1 ) 26 2020 9 17 26 2021 10 16 26 Thereafter 87 33 120 Total minimum lease payments $ 133 $ 118 $ (3 ) $ 248 (1) Amount includes an $84 million financing obligation, which we have recorded in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016, related to our corporate headquarters lease. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2016, other than the items discussed above, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 54 Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are parties to regulatory and legal matters. These matters may relate to claims involving alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, defamation, taxes, regulatory compliance and other claims. Periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company does not believe that the final disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the business. However, the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from our estimates. There may be claims or actions pending or threatened against us of which we are currently not aware and the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are also under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period for which that determination is made. By virtue of previously filed consolidated income tax returns filed with Expedia, we are currently under an IRS audit for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax years, and have various ongoing state income tax audits. We are separately under examination by the IRS for the 2012 and 2013 tax years and have commenced an employment tax audit with the IRS for the 2013 and 2014 tax years. These audits include questioning of the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. These examinations may lead to proposed or ordinary course adjustments to our taxes. We are no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2008. As of December 31, 2016, no material assessments have resulted, except as noted below regarding our 2009 and 2010 IRS audit with Expedia. As of December 31, 2016, no material assessments have resulted, except as noted below regarding our 2009 and 2010 IRS audit with Expedia. In January 2017, as part of the Company IRS audit of Expedia, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. These proposed adjustments are related to certain transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries, and would result in an increase to our worldwide income tax expense in an estimated range of $10 million to $14 million after consideration of competent authority relief, exclusive of interest and penalties. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and we intend to defend our position through applicable administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies. Our policy is to review and update tax reserves as facts and circumstances change. Based on our interpretation of the regulations and available case law, we believe the position we have taken with regard to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries is sustainable. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2009 and 2010 transactions, if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we would be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Additionally, we earn an increasing portion of our income, and accumulate a greater portion of cash flows, in foreign jurisdictions which we consider indefinitely reinvested. Any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and incremental cash tax payments. In addition, there have been proposals to amend U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact the manner in which U.S. companies are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation will pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our U.S. tax expense and cash flows. See Note 10 Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on potential contingencies surrounding current audits by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities, and other income tax matters. 55 Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions For information on our relationships with Expedia and Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. refer to Note 16 Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that management use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, where applicable and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time management was making the estimate; and/or Changes in the estimate or different estimates that management could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. A discussion of information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates is below. Business Combination Valuations and Recoverability of Goodwill, Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Business Combination Valuations and Goodwill. We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and assumed liabilities be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer and supplier relationships, acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Valuations are performed by management or third party valuation specialists under management's supervision, where appropriate. We assess goodwill, which is not amortized, for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition and becomes identified with the reporting unit in its entirety. Accordingly, the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is available to support the recoverability of its goodwill. We have determined each of our operating segments with goodwill represents a reporting unit for the purpose of assessing impairment for our 2016 impairment analysis. 56 In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we generally first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. However, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Periodically, we may choose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis to assist in our annual evaluation. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, such as the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition to establish an updated baseline quantitative analysis . During a qualitative assessment, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, we determine that it is more likely than not that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount, we then perform a quantitative assessment and compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise. In determining the estimated fair values of reporting units in a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we generally use a blend, of the following recognized valuation methods: the income approach (discounted cash flows model) and the market valuation approach, which we believe compensates for the inherent risks of using either model on a stand-alone basis. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit; income tax rates and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business and other precedent transactions. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and/or income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Valuations are performed by management or third party valuation specialists under management's supervision, where appropriate. We believe that the estimated fair values assigned to our reporting units in impairment tests are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates. During the Company's annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2016, a qualitative assessment of the Hotel, Vacation Rentals and Attraction reporting units' goodwill was performed, and a quantitative assessment of the Restaurant reporting unit goodwill was performed. For fiscal 2016, we determined the fair value of all our reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment charges during the year ending December 31, 2016. During fiscal 2016, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. As part of our qualitative assessment for our 2016 goodwill impairment analysis of our Hotel, Vacation Rentals and Attractions reporting units, the factors that we considered included, but were not limited to: (a) changes in macroeconomic conditions in the overall economy and the specific markets in which we operate, (b) our ability to access capital, (c) changes in the online travel industry, (d) changes in the level of competition, (e) evaluation of our current and future forecasted financial results (f) comparison of our current financial performance to historical and budgeted results, (g) changes in excess market capitalization over book value based on our common stock price and other market specific information, (h) changes in estimates and/or assumptions since the last quantitative analysis, (i) changes in the regulatory environment; and (j) changes in strategic outlook or organizational structure and leadership of the reporting units. As part of our quantitative assessment for our Restaurants reporting unit we determined its estimated fair value using a blend of an income approach (discounted cash flow model) and market valuation approach using an equal weighting. We concluded the estimated fair value was significantly in excess of its carrying value. We also performed a sensitivity analysis, calculating estimated fair values using different rates for the weighted-average cost of capital and long-term rates of growth in the income approach and different 57 revenue/income multiples in our market approach and the estimated fair value remained in excess of its carrying value. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is $30 million at December 31, 2016 and consists of trademarks and tradenames. Similar to the qualitative assessment for goodwill, we may assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is not more likely than not that the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, we determine that it is more likely than not that the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we compare the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its implied fair value, the individual asset is written down by an amount equal to such excess. The assessment of qualitative factors is optional and at our discretion. We may bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate future revenues, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in impairment, or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. During the Company's annual indefinite-lived intangible impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2016, a qualitative assessment was performed. As part of our qualitative assessment we considered, amongst other factors, the amount of excess fair value of our trade names and trademarks to the carrying value of those same assets, using the results of our most recent quantitative assessment, while also considering changes in estimates and/or assumptions since the last quantitative analysis. After considering these factors and the impact that changes in such factors would have on the inputs used in our previous quantitative assessment, we determined that it was more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired as of December 31, 2016. Definite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets. Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to twelve years. The straight-line method of amortization is currently used for our definite-lived intangible assets as it approximates, to date, or is our best estimate, of the distribution of the economic use of our identifiable intangible assets. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we assess the recoverability of the asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset of the group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured by the amount that the carrying values, of such asset groups, exceed their fair value and would be included in operating income on the consolidated statement of operations. We have not identified any circumstances that would warrant an impairment charge for any recorded definite lived or other long term assets, including our cost method investments, on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016. The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in different fair 58 values at the date of acquisition or in an impairment analysis or, in period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. For additional information on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and definite-lived intangibles refer to Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Income Taxes We record income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider all relevant factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as assessing available tax planning strategies. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. We have not provided for deferred U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which we intend to reinvest permanently outside the United States. Should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes. Due to complexities in tax laws and various assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable, at this time, to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these earnings. See Note 10 Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on income taxes. Stock-Based Compensation Stock Options The exercise price for all stock options granted by us to date has been equal to the market price of the underlying shares of common stock at the date of grant. In this regard, when making stock option awards, our practice is to determine the applicable grant date and to specify that the exercise price shall be the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2016 have a term of ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over a four-year requisite service period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 1,063,672 of primarily service based stock non-qualified stock options under our Amended and Restated 2011 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan (the 2011 Incentive tock Plan ) with a weighted average grant-date fair value per option of $22.95. We will amortize the fair value as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The estimated fair value of the options granted under the 2011 Incentive Plan to date, have been calculated 59 using a Black-Scholes Merton option-pricing model ( Black-Scholes model ). The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to fair value stock-based awards, which includes the risk-free rate of return, expected volatility, expected term and expected dividend yield. Our risk-free interest rate is based on the rates currently available on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issues, in effect at the time of the grant, whose remaining maturity period most closely approximates the stock option expected term assumption. Our expected volatility is calculated by equally weighting the historical volatility and implied volatility on our own common stock. Historical volatility is determined using actual daily price observations of our common stock price over a period equivalent to or approximate to the expected term of our stock option grants to date. Implied volatility represents the volatility calculated from the observed prices of our actively traded options on our common stock, with remaining maturities in excess of six months and market prices approximate to the exercise prices of the stock option grant. We estimate our expected term using historical exercise behavior and expected post-vest termination data. Our expected dividend yield is zero, as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date and do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of our common stock as the award vests. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued 2,015,898 of primarily service based RSUs under the 2011 Incentive Plan with a weighted average grant date fair value per option of $63.71. RSUs are measured at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. We amortize the fair value as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term (generally a four-year requisite service period) on a straight-line basis, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value. In the third quarter of 2016 we adopted new accounting guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) on stock compensation, or ASU 2016-09, as described in Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements below and have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than continue to estimate expected forfeitures. Refer to Note 4 Stock Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on our equity award activity. Websites and Internal Use Software Development Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of websites and internal use software when it is probable the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. Capitalized costs include internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, and deemed by management to be significant. We expense costs related to the planning and post-implementation phases of software and website development as these costs are incurred. Maintenance and enhancement costs (including those costs in the post-implementation stages) are typically expensed as incurred, unless such costs relate to substantial upgrades and enhancements to the website or software resulting in added functionality, in which case the costs are capitalized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our websites and internal use software, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of website and internal use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our recorded capitalized software and website development costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $86 million and $71 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $62 million and $52 million, respectively, related to software and website development costs. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded amortization of capitalized software and website development costs of $46 million, $37 million and $30 million, respectively, which is included in depreciation expense on our consolidated statements of operations for those years. 60 Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from our services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Deferred revenue, which primarily relates to our subscription-based and commission based arrangements, is recorded when payments are received in advance of our performance as required by the underlying agreements. Click-based advertising and transaction revenue . Click-based revenue is derived primarily from click-through fees charged to our travel partners for traveler leads sent to the travel partners website. We record revenue from click-through fees in the same period as when the traveler makes the click-through to the travel partners website. Our instant booking transaction model revenue is comprised of commissions earned on all valid instant booking reservations. In the transaction model, our instant booking commission revenue is recorded at the time a traveler books a hotel transaction on our partner site where we, as facilitator for such booking, do not assume associated cancellation risk. Under the other instant booking model, called the consumption model, we assume cancellation risk associated with booking, and we record that revenue in the month in which the traveler stay at a hotel occurs. We have no post-booking service obligations for all instant booking transactions, regardless of the model chosen. Display-based and subscription-based advertising. We recognize display-based advertising revenue ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the advertising contract. Subscription-based advertising revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual period over which service is delivered. Attractions . We work with local operators, or merchant partners, to provide travelers with access to tours and activities in popular destinations worldwide, earning a commission for such service. While the merchant of record, we receive cash from the consumer at the time of booking of the destination activity and record these amounts, net of commissions, as deferred merchant payables on our consolidated balance sheet. Commission revenue is recorded as deferred revenue at the time of booking and later recognized when the consumer has completed the destination activity. We pay the destination activity operators after the travelers use. In transactions where we are not the merchant of record, we invoice and receive commissions directly from our merchant partners and record commission revenue when the consumer has completed the destination activity. Restaurants . We recognize reservation revenues (or per seated diner fees) on a transaction-by-transaction basis as diners are seated by our restaurant customers. Subscription-based revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual period over which the service is delivered. Vacation Rentals . We generate revenue from customers for online advertising services related to the listing of their properties for rent primarily on either a subscription basis over a fixed-term, or on a commission basis for transactions that are booked on our platform. Payments for term-based subscriptions received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably to revenue on a straight-line basis over the listing period. Our commission revenue is primarily generated on our free-to-list option, in lieu of a pre-paid subscription fee. When a commissionable transaction is booked on our platform, we receive cash from the traveler that includes both our commission, which is recorded as deferred revenue, and the amount due to the property owner, which is recorded to deferred merchant payables on our consolidated balance sheet. We pay the amount due to the property owner and recognize our commission revenue at the time of the traveler stay. Additional revenues are also derived on a pay-per-lead basis, as we provide leads for rental properties to property managers. Pay-per-lead revenue is billed and recognized in the period when the leads are delivered to the property managers. New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In January 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which assist entities in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and will be applied prospectively to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted, including for interim or annual periods in 61 which the financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In January 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance removes Step two of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under the new guidance, a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. All other goodwill impairment guidance will remain largely unchanged. Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for any goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017 and will be applied prospectively. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In November 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flow. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period, but any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. Upon adoption, an entity may apply the new guidance only retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We anticipate adopting this new guidance on January 1, 2018, on a retrospective basis, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In October 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control within the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We anticipate adopting this new guidance on January 1, 2017, on a retrospective basis, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In October 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on income tax accounting associated with intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This accounting update, which is part of the FASB's simplification initiative, is intended to reduce diversity in practice and the complexity of tax accounting, particularly for those transfers involving intellectual property. This new guidance requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, an entity may apply the new guidance only on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and our intended adoption date. In August 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance specifically addresses the following cash flow topics in an effort to reduce diversity in practice: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (2) settlement of zero-coupon bonds; (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; (6) distributions received from equity method investees; (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, an entity may apply the new guidance only retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We anticipate adopting this new guidance on January 1, 2018, on a retrospective basis, and it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 62 In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on the measurement of credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes accounts receivable, and available-for-sale debt securities. For financial assets measured at amortized cost, this new guidance requires an entity to (1) estimate its lifetime expected credit losses upon recognition of the financial assets and establish an allowance to present the net amount expected to be collected, (2) recognize this allowance and changes in the allowance during subsequent periods through net income; and (3) consider relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in assessing the lifetime expected credit losses. For available-for-sale debt securities, this new guidance made several targeted amendments to the existing other-than-temporary impairment model, including (1) requiring disclosure of the allowance for credit losses, (2) allowing reversals of the previously recognized credit losses until the entity has the intent to sell, is more-likely-than-not required to sell the securities or the maturity of the securities, (3) limiting impairment to the difference between the amortized cost basis and fair value; and (4) not allowing entities to consider the length of time that fair value has been less than amortized cost as a factor in evaluating whether a credit loss exists. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted, including interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and our intended adoption date. In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on leases that is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet at the present value of the lease payments. The new guidance will classify leases as either finance or operating leases, with classification determining the presentation of expenses and cash flows on our consolidated financial statements. The guidance also requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, which will require the recognition and measurement of leases at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as well as still determining our adoption date. We anticipate giving additional updates on our Form-10Q during the first and second quarters of 2017. In January 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting update which amends the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the accounting update retains many current requirements, it significantly revises accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The accounting update also amends certain fair value disclosures of financial instruments and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale debt securities in combination with the entity evaluation of their other deferred tax assets. The update requires entities to carry all investments in equity securities, including other ownership interests such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies at fair value, with fair value changes recognized through net income. This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for equity method accounting, investments that result in consolidation of the investee or investments in which the entity has elected the practicability exception to fair value measurement. Under current U.S. GAAP, the Company's available-for-sale investments in equity securities with readily identifiable market value are remeasured to fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). However, under the new accounting literature, fair value adjustments will be recognized through net income and could vary significantly quarter to quarter. For the investments currently accounted for under the cost method, an entity can elect to measure its investments, which do not have a readily determinable fair value, at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Additionally, this accounting update will simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. In addition, this accounting update eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is currently required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost in the balance sheet. We anticipate adopting this new guidance on January 1, 2018 and are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 63 In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on revenue from contracts with customers which will replace numerous requirements in GAAP, and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires additional disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In March 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance which clarifies principal versus agent considerations and in April 2016, the FASB issued further guidance which clarifies the identification of performance obligations and the implementation guidance for licensing. The two permitted transition methods under this new accounting guidance are the full retrospective method, in which case the guidance would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the guidance would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the guidance would be recognized at the date of initial application. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. During 2016, we have made measurable progress toward completing our evaluation of the potential changes from adopting the new standard on our future financial reporting and disclosures. We have established a cross-functional implementation team from across our organization and have made significant progress in the review of our contracts portfolio and our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that could result from applying the requirements of the new standard to our revenue contracts. We will continue to evaluate the impact that this new guidance will have, if any, on the Company consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and are still determining the method of adoption we will elect for this new guidance. We anticipate adopting this new guidance on January 1, 2018, and plan on giving additional updates on our progress and further conclusions on our Form-10Q during the first and second quarters of 2017. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on stock compensation, or ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which changes how companies account for certain aspects of stock-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The new guidance permits recognizing the impact of forfeitures on stock-based compensation as they occur or to recognize stock-based compensation expense net of expected forfeitures, requires companies to record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the consolidated statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled, and eliminates the requirement to reclassify cash flows related to excess tax benefits from operating activities to financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of 2016, which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in our provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in capital for all periods in 2016. There was no impact to our provision for income taxes as previously reported for 2015 or prior periods. Additionally, our consolidated statement of cash flows now present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on a retrospective basis. As a result of the retrospective implementation of this guidance, the impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was an increase of $36 million and $20 million in cash flows from operating activities with an offsetting reduction in cash flows from financing activities. Finally, we have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures. The net cumulative effect of this change was recognized as a $1 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016. 64 Adoption of the new guidance resulted in the recognition of net excess tax expense and benefit in our provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in capital. As a result, we recorded $1 million of income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016, and impacted our previously reported quarterly results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, as follows: Three months ended March 31, 2016 As Reported As Adjusted (1)(2) (in millions, except per share data) Consolidated Statement of Operations: Operating income $ 42 $ 42 Provision for income taxes (11 ) (9 ) Net income 27 29 Basic EPS $ 0.19 $ 0.20 Diluted EPS $ 0.18 $ 0.20 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 120 $ 124 Net cash used in financing activities $ (94 ) $ (98 ) Three months ended June 30, 2016 As Reported As Adjusted (1) (in millions, except per share data) Consolidated Statement of Operations: Operating income $ 48 $ 47 Provision for income taxes (11 ) (10 ) Net income 34 34 Basic EPS $ 0.23 $ 0.23 Diluted EPS $ 0.23 $ 0.23 Six months ended June 30, 2016 As Reported As Adjusted (2) (in millions) Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 357 $ 363 Net cash used in financing activities $ (123 ) $ (129 ) (1) The election to account for forfeitures as they occur did not have a material impact for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and resulted in an increase to stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. (2) Includes the reclassification of cash flows related to excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities of $4 million and $2 million for the three months ending March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. In September 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 65 In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which clarifies the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. This standard clarified whether a customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as an acquisition of a software license or as a service arrangement by providing characteristics that a cloud computing arrangement must have in order to be accounted for as a software license acquisition. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a service contract. The company prospectively adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
