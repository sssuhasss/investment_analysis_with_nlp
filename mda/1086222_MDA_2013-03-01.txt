Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We provide content delivery and cloud infrastructure services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the Internet. We primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer, which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long-term contracts. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum. Alternatively, many of our customer contracts have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly, annual or longer periods. Having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success. Accordingly, to be successful, we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost recurring revenue due to price reductions and customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services and features that our existing customers purchase. At the same time, we must manage the rate of growth in our expenses as we invest in strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate future revenue growth. Accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality, price and the attractiveness of our services and technology. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See Risk Factors elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or other events that may be announced after the date hereof. Recent Event Effective January 1, 2013, F. Thomson Leighton became our new Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Leighton co-founded Akamai and has served as our Chief Scientist and as a director since August 1998. On January 24, 2013, we announced the acquisition by MediaMath, Inc. of substantially all of the assets used by us in our Advertising Decision Solutions business. Simultaneously with the sale, we entered into a multi-year relationship agreement whereby MediaMath will have exclusive rights to leverage our pixel-free technology for use within digital advertising and marketing applications. On February 6, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $150 million extension of its share repurchase program, effective for a 12-month period beginning February 1, 2013. As of this date, all prior repurchase authorizations have expired. Overview of Financial Results We increased our net income in 2012 to dollar levels that exceeded both 2011 and 2010 . The improvement primarily resulted from our efforts to increase our recurring revenues while effectively managing the expenses needed to support that growth. The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenues, consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated: 2012 2011 2010 Revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of revenues 31 32 30 Research and development 5 5 5 Sales and marketing 22 20 22 General and administrative 17 17 16 Amortization of other intangible assets 2 1 2 Restructuring charge Total costs and operating expenses 77 75 75 Income from operations 23 25 25 Income expense Interest income 1 1 1 Other income (expense), net Loss on early extinguishment of debt Income before provision for income taxes 24 26 26 Provision for income taxes 9 9 9 Net income 15 % 17 % 17 % 20 Table of Contents We were profitable for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 ; however, we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future. We have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future: Revenues and Customers During 2012 , we were able to offset lost committed recurring revenues by adding new customers and increasing sales of incremental services to our existing customers. A continuation of this trend could lead to increased revenues. Overall revenues are also impacted favorably by amounts we are paid for items such as traffic usage in excess of committed amounts and one-time events, but negatively impacted by price declines. Our unit prices offered to some customers have declined as a result of increased competition. These price reductions primarily impacted customers for which we deliver high volumes of traffic over our network, such as digital media customers. If we continue to experience decreases in unit prices and are unable to offset such reductions with increased traffic, enhanced efficiencies in our network, lower co-location and bandwidth expenses, or increased sales of incremental services to existing customers, our revenues and profit margins would decrease. During 2012 , we experienced an increase in the rate of traffic growth in our video and software download solutions as compared to 2011 . If this trend does not continue, our ability to generate revenue growth could be adversely impacted. We have historically experienced seasonal variations of higher revenues in the fourth quarter of the year and lower revenues during the summer months. We primarily attribute such variations to patterns of usage of e-commerce services by our retail customers. We expect this trend to continue, which could impact our ability to generate quarterly revenue growth on a sequential basis. During 2012 , revenues derived from customers outside the United States accounted for 28% of our total revenues. For 2013 , we anticipate revenues from such customers as a percentage of our total revenues to be consistent with 2012 . Costs and Expenses During 2012, we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit and to invest in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. Our total bandwidth costs increased during 2012 as compared to 2011 due to traffic growth on our network. We believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of expected higher traffic levels, partially offset by anticipated continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit. If we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing or we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers, total network bandwidth costs could increase more than expected in 2013. Co-location costs are a significant percentage of total cost of revenues. By improving our internal-use software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently, we believe we can manage the growth of co-location costs by deploying fewer servers. If we are unable to achieve such cost reductions, our profitability will be negatively impacted. Depreciation and amortization expense related to our network equipment and internal-use software development costs increased by $29.4 million during 2012 as compared to 2011. Due to the software and hardware initiatives we have undertaken to manage our global network more efficiently, we expect the useful lives of our network assets to be extended by approximately one year. This change is expected to decrease depreciation expense related to our network equipment during 2013, as compared to 2012. We also expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings, which would increase our internal-use software development costs attributable to employees working on such projects. As a result, we believe that the amortization of internal-use software development costs, which we include in cost of revenues, will be higher in 2013 as compared to 2012. Any of these increased costs could negatively affect our profitability. We expect to continue to grant restricted stock units, or RSUs, to employees in the future; therefore, we anticipate that stock-based compensation expense will increase compared to 2012 levels. As of December 31, 2012, our total unrecognized compensation costs for stock-based awards were $ 134.7 million , which we expect to recognize as expense over a weighted average period of 1.2 years. We expect to recognize this expense through 2016 . For fiscal 2012, our effective income tax rate was 36.6%. We expect our annual effective income tax rate in 2013 to decrease slightly as compared to 2012 due to the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit in the beginning of 2013, which is retroactive to 2012; however, this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with the accounting guidance for stock-based compensation, any tax planning strategies or the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations. 21 Table of Contents During 2012 we increased our headcount from 2,380 to 3,074 employees in support of product development initiatives and our global go-to-market strategy. This resulted in an increase in our operating expenses, as compared to 2011. We expect to continue to invest in these areas, as well as related administrative costs, to support our growth in 2013. If our operating costs grow faster than our revenue growth, our profitability will be negatively impacted. Based on our analysis of, among other things, the aforementioned trends and events, as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during 2013 ; however, our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, including our ability to: increase our revenue by adding customers through recurring revenue contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations; offset unit price declines for our services with higher volumes of traffic delivered on our network as well as increased sales of our value-added solutions; prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks; and maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues. As a result, there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives in any future period. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Our MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software costs, goodwill and other intangible assets, tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, loss contingencies and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Definitions We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes. Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition: We recognize service revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition, including guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. Revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly, quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly, quarterly or annual minimum. For these services, we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the service has been delivered to the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Should a customer usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum, we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage. For annual or other non-monthly period revenue commitments, we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof. We typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated. The integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement. We also derive revenue 22 Table of Contents from services sold as discrete, non-recurring events or based solely on usage. For these services, we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred. When more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement, we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, for each respective element, including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer. Elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services - the delivery of content, applications and software over the Internet - as well as mobile and security solutions, and enterprise professional services. These elements have value to our customer on a stand-alone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor. Additionally, there is not generally a right of return relative to these services. We typically use VSOE to determine the fair value of our separate elements. All stand-alone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average stand-alone selling price for those services. For our core services, the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis, when it is sold separately. For arrangements in which we are unable to establish VSOE, third-party evidence, or TPE, of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor. For arrangements in which we are unable to establish VSOE or TPE for each element, we use the best estimate of selling price ("BESP"), to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables. We estimate BESP based upon a management-approved product price list and pre-established discount levels for each product that takes into consideration volume, geography and industry lines. We allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method. At the inception of a customer contract, we make an estimate as to that customer ability to pay for the services provided. We base our estimate on a combination of factors, including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review, our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. If we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer. Changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize. We also sell our services through a reseller channel. Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller contracted non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments. Amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided. From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. If we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor product or service can be objectively established. We may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties. We record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service, such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service. If these conditions are present, we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees, prepayments made by customers for future periods, deferred integration and activation set-up fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms. Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. We record reserves against our accounts receivable balance. These reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash-basis. Increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses. Increases in the reserve for cash-basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue. The reserve for cash-basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured. The reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received. Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. We perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably 23 Table of Contents assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments. Valuation and Impairment of Investments and Marketable Securities: We measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability. Investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. We periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis, the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors, overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. Assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. Write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment. Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, such as fixed assets and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. The estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of each of December 31, 2012 and 2011 . We performed an impairment test of goodwill as of those dates, and the tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill. Other intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights. We engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets. Goodwill is carried at its historical cost. Loss Contingencies: We define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation. We record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote, we do not record a liability, but we disclose the nature of material loss contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Tax Reserves: Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized. 24 Table of Contents We currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated. Uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements under guidance that prescribes a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2012 , we had unrecognized tax benefits of $ 26.9 million , including accrued interest and penalties. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation: We issue stock-based compensation awards including stock options, RSUs and deferred stock units. We measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. We have selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. Our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. Changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock-based awards, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock options that are expected to be forfeited. Should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. Changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations. For stock options, RSUs and deferred stock units that contain only a service-based vesting feature, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the award's vesting period. For awards with a performance condition-based vesting feature, we recognize compensation cost on a graded-vesting basis over the awards expected vesting period, commencing when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs: We capitalize the salaries and payroll-related costs, as well as stock-based compensation expense, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software projects. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is complete, we estimate the useful life of the internal-use software, and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period. Results of Operations Revenues. Total revenues increased 19% , or $215.4 million , to $1,373.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $1,158.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Total revenues increased 13% , or $135.0 million , to $1,158.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $1,023.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The following table quantifies the increase in revenues attributable to the different industry verticals in which we sell our services (in millions): 25 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011 For the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 Media & Entertainment $ 90.7 $ 45.7 Commerce 50.4 46.1 Enterprise 32.9 33.5 High Tech 31.2 4.9 Public Sector 10.2 4.8 Total net increase $ 215.4 $ 135.0 We believe that the continued growth in use of the Internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services during each of the last several years. We expect this trend to continue in 2013 , but our revenue may increase at a lower rate due to competitive factors, general economic conditions and the impact of the sale of our Advertising Decisions Solutions, or ADS, business in early 2013. Our growth rate in 2012 benefited from revenues from acquisitions; we may not experience such benefits in 2013. Revenues from our media and entertainment vertical increased due to traffic growth stemming from increased online media consumption. Revenues from our commerce and enterprise verticals for 2012 as compared to 2011 , as well as 2011 as compared to 2010 , increased due to growth in application and cloud performance solutions, particularly security-related solutions, sold to customers in these verticals. Revenues from our high tech vertical increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to increased demand for cloud performance solutions and higher software download volumes. Revenues from the public sector increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to the timing of completion of certain elements of government agency contracts. Our 2011 revenues from the public sector and high tech verticals did not materially change as compared to 2010 . For 2012, 2011 and 2010 , 28% , 29% and 28% , respectively, of our total revenues were derived from our operations located outside of the United States. Revenue from our operations in Europe represented 17% , 18% and 17% of total revenues for 2012, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Other than the United States, no single country accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues during these periods. We expect international sales as a percentage of our total sales in 2013 to remain consistent as compared to 2012. Resellers accounted for 22% of total revenues in 2012 , 19% in 2011 and 18% in 2010 . Approximately 1% of the increase in 2012 was attributable to a change in classification of certain direct customers to resellers. For 2012, 2011 and 2010 , no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co-location of our network equipment. Cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stock-based compensation expense for network operations personnel, cost of software licenses, depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal-use software. Cost of revenues was comprised of the following (in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Bandwidth and service-related fees $ 114.5 $ 92.0 $ 79.9 Co-location fees 132.0 130.8 96.1 Payroll and related costs of network operations personnel 19.3 15.3 14.0 Stock-based compensation, including amortization of prior capitalized amounts 10.3 9.6 10.3 Depreciation of network equipment 118.0 96.8 76.3 Amortization of internal-use software 37.8 30.0 26.8 Total cost of revenues $ 431.9 $ 374.5 $ 303.4 Cost of revenues increased 15% , or $57.4 million , to $431.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $374.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Cost of revenues increased 23% , or $71.1 million , to $374.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $303.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . 26 Table of Contents For each period, this increase was primarily due to: an increase in amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth due to higher traffic levels, partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit; and an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure Additionally, in each of 2012, 2011 and 2010 , cost of revenues included stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; such expense increased by $0.7 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 and decreased by $0.7 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 . Cost of revenues during each of 2012, 2011 and 2010 also included credits received of approximately $10.8 million , $6.9 million and $7.1 million , respectively, from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts. Credits of this nature may occur in the future; however, the timing and amount of future credits, if any, are unpredictable. We have long-term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co-location with various networks and Internet service providers. As of December 31, 2012 , our current minimum commitments for the years ending December 31, 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 and 2017 were approximately $98.8 million , $10.0 million , $1.3 million , $0.1 million and $ 0.1 million , respectively. We believe cost of revenues will increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 . We expect to deploy more servers and to deliver more traffic on our network, which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic; however, such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit. Additionally, for 2013 , we anticipate increases in amortization of internal-use software development costs , along with increased payroll and related costs, as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand. Due to the software and hardware initiatives we have undertaken to manage our global network more efficiently, we expect the useful lives our of network assets to be extended by approximately one year. This change is expected to decrease depreciation expense related to our network equipment during 2013, as compared to 2012. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stock-based compensation expense for research and development personnel who design, develop, test, deploy and enhance our services and our network. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , we capitalized software development costs of $50.6 million , $40.4 million and $31.1 million , respectively. These development costs consisted of external consulting, payroll and payroll-related costs for personnel involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , we capitalized as internal-use software $8.9 million , $7.1 million and $7.6 million , respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation, net of impairments. We amortize these capitalized internal-use software costs to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years. Research and development expenses increased 43% , or $22.4 million , to $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Research and development expenses decreased 4% , or $2.4 million , to $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $54.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The increase in research and development expenses in 2012 as compared to 2011 was due to increases in payroll and related costs and stock-based compensation as a result of headcount growth, partially offset by capitalized salaries. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due to higher capitalized salaries and a decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by increases in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth. The following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Research and Development Expenses 2012 to 2011 2011 to 2010 Payroll and related costs $ 25.8 $ 9.1 Stock-based compensation 6.1 (3.9 ) Capitalized salaries and related costs (10.9 ) (8.0 ) Other expenses 1.4 0.4 Total net increase (decrease) $ 22.4 $ (2.4 ) 27 Table of Contents We believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology, develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs, stock-based compensation expense, commissions for personnel engaged in marketing, sales and support functions and advertising and promotional expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 34% , or $77.1 million , to $304.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $227.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Sales and marketing expenses increased $0.6 million , to $227.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $226.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs, including commissions for sales and sales support personnel, attributable to revenue growth, an increase in stock-based compensation and higher marketing and related costs and other expenses. The increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs, including commissions for sales and sales support personnel, attributable to revenue growth, largely offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation, marketing and related costs and other expenses. The following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Sales and Marketing Expenses 2012 to 2011 2011 to 2010 Payroll and related costs $ 49.0 $ 10.3 Stock-based compensation 14.7 (7.5 ) Marketing and related costs 10.3 (0.4 ) Other expenses 3.1 (1.8 ) Total net increase $ 77.1 $ 0.6 We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in 2013 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services and an increase in payroll and related costs due to continued growth in the number of our sales and marketing personnel. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components: payroll, stock-based compensation expense and other related costs, including expenses for executive, finance, business applications, network management, human resources and other administrative personnel; network support costs; depreciation and amortization of property and equipment we use internally; fees for professional services; rent and other facility-related expenditures for leased properties; the provision for doubtful accounts; acquisition-related costs; insurance costs; and non-income related taxes. General and administrative expenses increased 18% , or $35.3 million , to $227.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $191.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . General and administrative expenses increased 14% , or $23.9 million , to $191.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $167.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2012 as compared to 2011 , was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth, higher stock-based compensation expense, costs related to the acquisitions of four companies in 2012 and an increase in the consulting, advisory and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the legal fees and the provision for doubtful accounts. The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2011 as compared to 2010 , was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth, an increase in facilities-related costs and other expenses, an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts, and an increase in legal fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation and non-income tax expenses. 28 Table of Contents The following table quantifies the net increase in various components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in General and Administrative Expenses 2012 to 2011 2011 to 2010 Payroll and related costs $ 15.9 $ 11.5 Stock-based compensation 7.9 (3.7 ) Non-income taxes 0.4 (0.4 ) Facilities-related costs 0.6 7.4 Depreciation and amortization 3.1 0.8 Provision for doubtful accounts (1.8 ) 1.8 Legal fees (1.2 ) 1.8 Acquisition related costs 5.2 1.0 Consulting, advisory and other expenses 5.2 3.7 Total net increase $ 35.3 $ 23.9 We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights. Amortization of other intangible assets increased 23% , or $3.9 million , to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Amortization of other intangible assets increased 2% , or $ 0.4 million , to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , as compared to $ 16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2012 as compared to 2011 was due to the completion of acquisitions of four companies in 2012. The increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due to the acquisition of Velocitude in June 2010. As of December 31, 2012 , we anticipate that amortization expense will be approximately $24.3 million , $19.3 million , $16.6 million , $11.7 million and $7.6 million for the years ending December 31, 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 and 2017 , respectively. Restructuring Charge. We recorded a restructuring charge of $ 0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily in connection with workforce reductions related to the acquisitions of FastSoft and Verivue during 2012. We recorded a restructuring charge of $ 4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily in connection with a workforce reduction we implemented in December 2011.This charge included $4.2 million of employee severance benefits and $0.7 million of restructuring charges attributable to vacated facility leases. We did not have any restructuring charges in 2010 . Our restructuring liabilities associated with employee severance benefits are expected to be fully paid in 2013. Restructuring liabilities associated with facility leases will be fully paid through December 2019. Interest Income. Interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities. Interest income decreased 40% , or $4.3 million , to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Interest income decreased 12% , or $1.5 million , to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The decreases in 2012 as compared to 2011 and in 2011 as compared to 2010 were primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments during the comparable periods. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes interest that was paid on our former debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had no outstanding interest-bearing indebtedness requiring the payment of interest and therefore had no interest expense. During the year ended December 31, 2010 we had $1.7 million of interest expense, primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our 1% convertible senior notes. During 2010 we converted into common stock an aggregate of $199.8 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible note during that year. Other Income (Expense), net. Other income (expense) , net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred, gains and losses from legal settlements, and other non-operating income (expense) items. Other income (expense), net decreased $5.5 million to $0.6 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $6.1 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Other income (expense), net increased $8.6 million to $6.1 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $2.5 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The increase in other income (expense), net for the period ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the period ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due 29 Table of Contents to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on inter-company and other transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of foreign exchange losses and net funds received and paid as part of litigation settlements. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted of foreign exchange losses. Other income (expense), net may fluctuate in the future based upon changes in foreign exchange rates, the outcome of legal proceedings or other events. Gain (Loss) on Investments, net. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we recorded a small net gain on investments of primarily related to the sale of marketable securities. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , we recorded a net loss on investments of $0.2 million related to a write-off of an equity investment and partially offset by gains from the sale of marketable securities. During the year ended December 31, 2010 , we recorded a net gain on investments of $ 0.4 million primarily related to the sale of marketable securities. Additionally, during 2010 we recorded a gain of $9.6 million due to a decrease in the other-than-temporary impaiment of certain auction rate securities, or ARS, offset by a loss of $9.6 million on a put option related to our ARS holdings. Provision for Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , our effective tax rate of 36.6% was higher than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of non-deductible stock based compensation, partially offset by benefits recorded for state research and development tax credits and the tax rate differential on foreign earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2011 , our effective tax rate of 34.6% was lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits and the tax rate differential on foreign earnings, partially offset by state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2010 , our effective tax rate of 34.7% was lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits partially offset by state income taxes. Provision for income taxes increased 11%, or $11.3 million, to $117.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Provision for income taxes increased 17%, or $15.1 million, to $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The increase from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in operating income, as well as the expiration of the federal research and development credit at the end of 2011. The increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in operating income. On January 2, 2013, the President signed into law The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Under prior law, a taxpayer was entitled to a research tax credit for qualifying amounts paid or incurred on or before December 31, 2011. The 2012 Taxpayer Relief Act extends the research credit for two years to December 31, 2013. The extension of the research credit is retroactive and includes amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2011. As a result of the retroactive extension, we expect to recognize a benefit of approximately $4.8 million for qualifying amounts incurred in 2012. The benefit will be recognized in the period of enactment, which is the first quarter of 2013. We expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2013 to decrease due to the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit at the beginning of 2013, as well as the change in mix of income in various jurisdictions; this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of stock-based compensation or any potential tax planning strategies. Our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options. Further, our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, including settlements of tax audits and assessments, the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies. In determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates, and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of NOL carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial measures reflected in our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, we also compile and monitor certain non-GAAP financial measures related to the performance of our business. We have discussed the non-GAAP financial measures described below on our quarterly public earnings release calls and in other investor presentations. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial 30 Table of Contents position or cash flows that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the GAAP statement of operations or includes amounts that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. We believe that making available non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors as they examine our past performance and future prospects, especially when comparing such results to previous periods. Our management uses some of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods. Some of these financial measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP financial measures should only be used as a supplement to results presented in accordance with GAAP. In the periods presented, we calculated normalized net income by adding the following items on a non-tax-effected basis to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP: amortization of other acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; stock-based compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internal-use software; restructuring charges and benefits; acquisition-related costs and benefits; certain gains and losses on investments; loss on early extinguishment of debt; gains and losses on legal settlements and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. The following table reconciles GAAP net income to normalized net income and normalized net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Unaudited For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Net income $ 203,989 $ 200,904 $ 171,220 Amortization of other acquired intangible assets 20,962 17,070 16,657 Stock-based compensation 90,585 61,305 76,468 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation 7,680 7,308 7,509 Loss (gain) on investments, net 500 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 299 Acquisition related costs (benefits) 5,787 580 (415 ) Restructuring charge 406 4,886 Legal settlements, net (8,043 ) Total normalized net income $ 329,409 $ 284,510 $ 271,738 Normalized net income per diluted share $ 1.81 $ 1.52 $ 1.43 Shares used in normalized net income per diluted share calculation 181,749 187,556 190,650 As indicated in the text and reconciliation above, we have historically reported normalized net income by adding the items above on a non-tax-effected basis to GAAP net income. If we were to tax-effect the above items in our calculation of normalized net income, normalized net income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 would have been $291 million, or $1.60 per share; $256 million, or $1.37 per share; and $234 million, or $1.23 per share, respectively. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same way that we calculate normalized net income except that we also add interest income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets. The following table reconciles GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 : 31 Table of Contents Unaudited For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Net income $ 203,989 $ 200,904 $ 171,220 Amortization of other acquired intangible assets 20,962 17,070 16,657 Stock-based compensation 90,585 61,305 76,468 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation 7,680 7,308 7,509 Loss (gain) on investments, net 500 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 299 Acquisition related costs (benefits) 5,787 580 (415 ) Restructuring charge 406 4,886 Legal settlements, net (8,043 ) Interest income, net of interest expense (6,455 ) (10,921 ) (10,862 ) Provision for income taxes 117,602 106,291 91,152 Depreciation and amortization 175,521 143,500 119,076 Other (income) loss, net (649 ) 1,918 2,468 Adjusted EBITDA $ 615,428 $ 525,298 $ 473,572 Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated by operations, public and private sales of debt and equity securities and proceeds from exercises of stock awards. As of December 31, 2012 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which consisted of corporate debt securities, United States treasury and government agency securities, commercial paper and money market funds, totaled $1,095.2 million , the majority of which is located in the United States. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy also limits our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal, maintaining adequate liquidity at all times, and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $77.9 million to $530.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $452.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . The change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to increases in receipts from customers which were partially offset by increases in payments to vendors as well as increases in payments for employee payroll. The increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities were primarily driven by the timing of payments in the normal business cycle. These increases were offset by a decrease in our provision for deferred income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $ 50.1 million to $ 452.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $ 402.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation and amortization expense and a decrease in our excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, offset by a decrease in our provision for deferred income taxes. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will increase in 2013 as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues, partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions. Current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates. Net cash used in investing activities was $779.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $171.1 million of net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Net cash used in investing activities was $335.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Cash used in investing activities for 2012 reflects purchases of short- and long-term marketable securities of $ 752.3 million , purchases of property and equipment of $219.8 million, including the capitalization of internal-use software development costs and cash paid for the acquisition of four companies in 2012 for $ 336.7 million in the aggregate. Amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset, in part, by proceeds from sales and maturities of short- and long-term marketable securities of $530.1 million. During 2011 , we had a significant increase in cash provided by investing activities due to investments maturing that we did not reinvest in short- and long-term marketable securities. Cash provided by investing activities for 2011 reflects proceeds from sales and redemptions of short- and long-term marketable securities 32 Table of Contents of $ 701.3 million , proceeds from maturities of short- and long-term marketable securities of $ 532.9 million , proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $ 0.2 million and a decrease in cash investments held for security deposits of $ 0.3 million . This was offset in part by purchases of short- and long-term marketable securities of $ 880.1 million , purchases of property and equipment of $ 182.9 million , including the capitalization of internal-use software development costs and earn out payments related to our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Velocitude LLC, or Velocitude, of $ 0.6 million . Cash used in investing activities for 2010 reflects purchases of short- and long-term marketable securities of $1,146.5 million, purchases of property and equipment of $192.0 million, including the capitalization of internal-use software development costs, cash paid for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Velocitude of $12.7 million, and an increase in other investments of $0.5 million. Amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset, in part, by proceeds from sales and maturities of short- and long-term marketable securities of $1,015.8 million. For 2013 , we expect total capital expenditures, a component of cash used in investing activities, to remain consistent with 2012 as a percentage of total revenue for the year. We expect to fund such capital expenditures through cash generated from operations. Cash used in financing activities decreased $ 185.6 million to $108.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $294.1 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Cash used in financing activities was $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Cash used in financing activities for the year-ended December 31, 2012 consisted of $141.5 million related to our 2012 common stock repurchase programs, as well as $34.7 million used to pay taxes related to net share settlements of employee equity awards. This amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which included proceeds of $44.7 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and $23.0 million related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of $ 324.1 million related to our 2011 common stock repurchase programs, as well as $ 8.4 million used to pay taxes related to the net share settlement of employee equity awards. This amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 , which included proceeds of $ 25.3 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and $ 13.1 million related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Cash used in financing activities for the year-ended December 31, 2010 consisted of $ 92.4 million related to our 2010 common stock repurchase programs. This amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 , which included proceeds of $ 45.8 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and $ 29.0 million related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as deferred revenue, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure, including debt and equity repurchases and issuances, stock option exercises, sales of equity investments and similar events. 33 Table of Contents The following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented (in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at the beginning of the period $ 1,230.0 $ 1,243.4 $ 1,061.5 Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Receipts from customers 1,422.9 1,160.8 1,027.7 Payments to vendors (786.3 ) (619.3 ) (556.4 ) Payments for employee payroll (330.3 ) (291.3 ) (247.3 ) Common stock repurchases (141.5 ) (324.1 ) (92.4 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on marketable investments and other investment-related assets, net 1.0 12.8 6.5 Debt interest and premium payments (1.3 ) Stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan issuances 44.7 25.3 45.8 Cash used in business acquisitions (336.7 ) (0.6 ) (12.7 ) Employee taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards (34.7 ) (8.4 ) Legal settlements, net 8.0 Interest income 6.4 10.7 12.2 Other 19.7 12.7 (0.2 ) Net (decrease) increase (134.8 ) (13.4 ) 181.9 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at the end of the period $ 1,095.2 $ 1,230.0 $ 1,243.4 We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months. Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2012 , for the next five years and thereafter (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 12 Months 12 to 36 Months 36 to 60 Months More than 60 Months Real estate operating leases $ 155.1 $ 33.2 $ 58.8 $ 33.4 $ 29.7 Bandwidth and co-location agreements 110.4 98.8 11.3 0.2 0.1 Open vendor purchase orders 54.3 48.6 5.7 Total contractual obligations $ 319.8 $ 180.6 $ 75.8 $ 33.6 $ 29.8 In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of December 31, 2012 , we had unrecognized tax benefits of $ 26.9 million , which included $ 5.9 million of accrued interest and penalties. As of December 31, 2012 , we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately $3.7 million of our unrecognized tax benefits, each of which are individually insignificant and include research and development credits and transfer pricing adjustments, may be recognized by the end of 2013 as a result of ongoing audits. Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2012 , we had outstanding $6.2 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third-party beneficiaries, primarily related to facility leases. These irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until December 2019. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 34 Table of Contents We have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. Litigation We are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued amended guidance and disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and international financial reporting standards. The guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2012. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued amended disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income. The amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income ( OCI ) as part of the statement of changes in equity. Under the amended guidance, all changes in OCI are to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2012. There is no impact to our consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation. In September 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. Under the amended guidance, after assessment of certain qualitative factors, if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity must perform the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the quantitative test(s) are optional. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2012. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2012, the FASB issued amended guidance on the periodic testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. This guidance allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test required under current accounting standards. The updated accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after September 15, 2012 with early adoption permitted. We adopted the updated guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance and disclosure requirements for reporting of comprehensive income: amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The guidance requires that an entity provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2012. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2013 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results. 35 Table of Contents
