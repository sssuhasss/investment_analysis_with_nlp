ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont or the Company ). References to A$ refer to Australian currency, CDN$ to Canadian currency, CHF to Swiss currency, NZD$ to New Zealand currency, IDR to Indonesian currency and U.S.$ or $ to United States currency. This discussion addresses matters we consider important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2004, as well as our future results. It consists of the following subsections: Overview, which provides a brief summary of our consolidated results and financial position and the primary factors affecting those results, as well as a summary of our expectations for 2005; Accounting Changes, which provides a discussion of recent changes to our accounting policies that have affected our consolidated results and financial position; Critical Accounting Policies, which provides an analysis of the accounting policies we consider critical because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses in 47 Table of Contents our consolidated financial statements and because they require difficult, subjective or complex judgments by our management; Consolidated Financial Results, which includes a discussion of our consolidated financial results for the last three years; Results of Operations, which sets forth an analysis of the operating results for the last three years of Newmont gold and copper operations, the Merchant Banking Segment and the Exploration Segment; Recent Accounting Pronouncements, which summarizes recently published authoritative accounting guidance, how it might apply to us and how it might affect our future results; and Liquidity and Capital Resources, which contains a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, investing activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Overview Newmont is the world largest gold producer and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties. We have operations in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Uzbekistan, Bolivia, New Zealand and Mexico. We have an advanced development project in Ghana, which is expected to become our next core operating district. During the last several years we have expanded our global footprint through our exploration efforts and through the acquisition of operating and development assets. We believe that Newmont is positioned to remain a gold industry leader capable of achieving further profitable growth as we discover, acquire and develop new projects. We face key risks associated with our business. One of the most significant risks is fluctuation in the prices of gold and copper, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Other challenges we face are production cost increases and social and environmental issues. Operating costs at our operations are subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grades, metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore bodies. At foreign locations, such costs are also influenced by currency fluctuations that may affect our U.S. dollar operating costs. In addition, we must continually replace reserves depleted by production. Depleted reserves must be replaced by expanding known ore bodies, by acquisition or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term. Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance The table below highlights key financial and operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net income applicable to common shares (in millions) $ 443.3 $ 475.7 $ 154.3 Net income per share, basic $ 1.00 $ 1.16 $ 0.42 Revenues (in millions) $ 4,524.2 $ 3,157.8 $ 2,622.2 Equity gold sales (in thousands of ounces) 6,988.4 7,383.6 7,631.7 Equity copper sales (in millions of pounds) 422.3 417.7 407.0 Average gold price received ($/ounce) $ 412 $ 366 $ 313 Total cash costs ($/ounce) (1) $ 231 $ 203 $ 189 Total production costs ($/ounce) (1) $ 295 $ 266 $ 250 (1) Total cash costs and total production costs are non-GAAP measures of performance that we use to determine the cash generating capacities of our mining operations and to monitor the performance of our mining operations. For a reconciliation of Costs applicable to sales to total cash costs and total production costs per ounce (unaudited), see Item 2, Properties, above. 48 Table of Contents Consolidated Financial Performance Increased revenues in 2004 from 2003 primarily resulted from the consolidation of Batu Hijau and higher gold and copper prices, offset by lower gold sales. Increased revenues in 2003 from 2002 resulted from higher gold prices. Our equity gold sales decreased to 7.0 million equity ounces in 2004 from 7.4 million equity ounces in 2003 primarily due to lower production in Nevada due to lower average grades and at Ovacik due to the suspension of operations in August 2004 (see Results of Operations below). Our equity gold sales in 2003 were slightly lower than the 7.6 million ounces in 2002 because of the Company divestiture of non-core investments and operations. During 2004 and 2003, the weakening U.S. dollar and other factors helped strengthen gold prices and as a result, our average realized price per ounce increased from $313 in 2002 to $366 in 2003 and to $412 in 2004. The average realized gold price increases over the last few years were partially offset by higher production costs and lower equity gold ounces sold. During the past three years, Newmont has seen significant increases in the costs of fuel, power and other bulk consumables. In addition, our production costs were affected by increases in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. While a weaker U.S. dollar generally benefits the gold price, which is quoted in U.S. dollars, it also results in higher costs quoted in U.S. dollars at certain of our foreign operations. We experienced appreciation of 13% between 2004 and 2003 and 17% between 2003 and 2002 in the average Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. Equity gold ounces sold have decreased due to lower grade ores and the sale of non-core mines. In addition, our financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2004 were impacted by the following: Consolidation of Batu Hijau as a result of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No. 46R ( FIN 46R ) as of January 1, 2004 (see Accounting Changes below); Write-down of goodwill at the Pajingo reporting unit (Australia/New Zealand segment) ($51.8 million); Significantly higher amounts spent on exploration, research and development; Income tax expense of $275.9 million in 2004 compared to $207.0 million in 2003; and Write-down of available-for-sale marketable equity securities of Kinross ($38.5 million). Liquidity The Company financial position at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows: At December 31, 2004 2003 (in millions) Total debt $ 1,596.7 $ 1,077.5 Total stockholders equity $ 7,937.7 $ 7,384.9 Cash and cash equivalents $ 782.7 $ 1,131.1 During 2004, our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Total debt increased $848.6 million and cash and cash equivalents increased $82.2 million effective January 1, 2004 as a result of the consolidation of Batu Hijau (see Accounting Changes below); Net debt repayments of $197.8 million; Net investment of $601.5 million in marketable debt securities; Investment of $224.2 million in marketable equity securities; 49 Table of Contents Capital expenditures of $718.0 million; Dividends paid to common shareholders of $133.3 million; and Dividends paid to minority interests of $236.9 million. Looking Forward Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to the following: Fluctuations in gold prices and, to a lesser extent, copper prices; Given the progress made on development projects, production is anticipated to range between 6.5 million and 7.0 million equity ounces per year through 2007. We anticipate that our Ahafo advanced development project in Ghana, West Africa, will generate steady-state annual gold sales of approximately 500,000 ounces commencing in 2006, with higher production in the initial years. We expect to make an investment decision on the Akyem project, also in Ghana, by mid 2005. In Nevada, at the Leeville underground project ore production is expected to begin in late 2005 with annual gold production of approximately 450,000 to 500,000 ounces, while annual production from the Phoenix project, anticipated to begin operating in 2006, is expected to be between 370,000 to 420,000 ounces of gold and 16 to 40 million pounds of copper; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar will continue to affect our future profitability and cash flow. Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins, total cash costs per ounce and capital costs to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. Historically, such fluctuations have not had a material impact on the Company revenue since gold is sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. The Company total cash costs are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations in the Company consolidated financial statements. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future; Capital expenditures in 2004 were $718.0 million. We expect to increase capital expenditures in 2005 to between $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, including costs related to the Ahafo project in Ghana, the Leeville and Phoenix projects in Nevada, the power plant project in Nevada and mine equipment, leach pad expansions and processing facilities at Yanacocha; and We expect 2005 exploration, research and development expenditures will total between $170 million and $200 million. Accounting Changes Consolidation of Batu Hijau In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, which provides guidance on the identification and reporting for entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46R defines such entities as variable interest entities ( VIEs ). Application of this revised interpretation was required in financial statements for companies that have interests in VIEs or potential VIEs commonly referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 31, 2003. Application for all other types of entities was required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. 50 Table of Contents Newmont identified the Nusa Tenggara Partnership ( NTP ) and P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara ( PTNNT ) (collectively, Batu Hijau ) as VIEs because of certain capital structures and contractual relationships (primarily the sharing of the expected residual returns with a party that did not have an equity investment at risk that is considered significant to the total expected residual returns, as well as indications of insufficient equity). Newmont also determined that it is the primary beneficiary of Batu Hijau. Therefore, as of January 1, 2004, the Company has fully consolidated Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For periods prior to 2004, the investment in Batu Hijau was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Upon consolidation of Batu Hijau, effective January 1, 2004, certain adjustments were recorded to the opening balance sheet of PTNNT to conform to Newmont accounting policies. These adjustments were recorded to change from units-of-production depreciation of processing plant and mining facilities to straight-line depreciation of such facilities and to change from allocating costs to stockpile inventories based on mining costs per ton to allocating costs based on recoverable pounds of copper equivalent contained in the various categories of stockpiles. The impact of these adjustments were charges of $15.1 million and $32.0 million, respectively, which have been recorded in Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax in the 2004 Consolidated Statement of Income, net of income tax expense and minority interest. The consolidation had a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Mineral Interests On April 30, 2004, a FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) was issued amending Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141 and No. 142 to provide that certain mineral rights are considered tangible assets and that mineral rights should be accounted for based on their substance. The FSP was effective for the first reporting period beginning after April 29, 2004, with early adoption permitted. As a result, Newmont reclassified all of its mineral, royalty and oil and gas interests, with a carrying value of $1,273.0 million, from mineral interests and other intangible assets to Property, plant and mine development, net in its balance sheets and ceased amortization of exploration stage mineral interests effective April 1, 2004. The aggregate amortization expense related to mineral, royalty and oil and gas interests was $110.5 million and $150.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Reclamation and Remediation (Asset Retirement Obligations) In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which established a uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. Newmont adopted SFAS No. 143 as required and as a result, on January 1, 2003, Reclamation and remediation liabilities increased by $120.7 million for the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligations, Other current liabilities increased by $2.3 million, Deferred income tax assets increased by $11.2 million, Property, plant and mine development, net increased by $69.1 million, Minority interest in subsidiaries decreased by $16.2 million, Investments decreased by $8.0 million and a $34.5 million loss was recorded for the Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax. In 2002, the pro forma effect would have increased net income by $0.2 million ($0.00 per share) had the accounting change been in effect during the period. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Newmont changed its accounting policy effective January, 1, 2002, with respect to Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A ) of Property, plant and mine development, net to exclude future estimated development costs expected to be incurred for certain underground operations. In addition, the Company revised its policy such that costs incurred to access specific ore blocks are depreciated, depleted, or amortized over the reserves associated with the specific ore area. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle through December 31, 2001 increased net income in 2002 by $7.7 million, net of tax of $4.1 million, and increased net income per share by $0.02. 51 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that the Company believes are critical to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported . Carrying Value of Goodwill At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying value of the Company goodwill was approximately $3.0 billion. Such goodwill was assigned to the Company Merchant Banking (approximately $1.6 billion) and Exploration (approximately $1.1 billion) Segments and to various mine site reporting units (approximately $300 million in the aggregate). This goodwill primarily arose in connection with the Company February 15, 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada, and it represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of Normandy and Franco-Nevada. The Company approach to allocating goodwill was to identify those reporting units of the Company that the Company believed had contributed to such excess purchase price. The Company then performed valuations to measure the incremental increases in the fair values of such reporting units that were attributable to the acquisitions, and that were not already captured in the fair values assigned to such units identifiable net assets. In the case of the Merchant Banking and Exploration Segments, these valuations were based on each reporting unit potential for future growth, and in the case of the mine site reporting units, the valuation was based on the synergies that were expected to be realized by each mine site reporting unit. The Company evaluates, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish this, the Company compares the fair values of its reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value at the time of the evaluation, the Company would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount and any shortfall would be charged to income. Assumptions underlying fair value estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Newmont performed its annual impairment tests of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2004 and determined that goodwill at one reporting unit, Pajingo, was impaired at December 31, 2004, as discussed below. To the extent the assumptions used in the Company valuation models laid out below for such impairment tests are not achieved in the future, it is reasonably possible that the Company will record charges for impairment of goodwill in future periods. The specific application of the Company goodwill impairment policy with respect to the Merchant Banking Segment, Exploration Segment and mine site reporting units is separately discussed below. Merchant Banking Segment Goodwill Newmont Merchant Banking Segment is comprised of an Equity Portfolio sub-segment, focused on managing the Company portfolio of equity securities, a Royalty Portfolio sub-segment, a Value Realization sub-segment, providing in-house investment banking and advisory services to the Company, and a Downstream Gold Refining sub-segment. The Merchant Banking Segment did not exist prior to the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada in February 2002. At December 31, 2004, the $1.6 billion carrying value of the Merchant Banking Segment goodwill represented approximately 65% of the carrying value of the total assets of the Merchant Banking Segment. Based on a December 31, 2004 valuation of the Merchant Banking Segment, the Company concluded that the fair value of the Merchant Banking Segment was significantly in excess of its carrying value at December 31, 2004. The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow analysis for the Equity Portfolio sub-segment of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) pre-tax returns on investment ranging from 35% starting in 2005 and gradually declining to 15% in 2012 through 2014; (iv) an initial equity portfolio investment of approximately $0.5 billion; (v) capital infusions of $50 million annually for the next three years; and (vi) a terminal value of approximately $2.2 billion. The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow 52 Table of Contents analysis for the Royalty Portfolio sub-segment of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) an annual growth rate of 5% in the royalty portfolio; and (iv) a pre-tax rate of return on investment of 13%. The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow analysis for the Value Realization sub-segment of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax advisory fee of 5% on approximately $500 million of transactions and value-added activities in 2005, with the dollar amount of such transactions and activities increasing by 5% annually thereafter. The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow analysis for the Downstream Gold Refining sub-segment of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax annual return on investments of $4.2 million. The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow analysis assumed a combined terminal value for the royalty portfolio, portfolio management and downstream gold refining sub-segments of approximately $0.7 billion. For purposes of valuing the Merchant Banking Segment at future fiscal year ends, the Company expects that the valuation model will continue to be reevaluated and enhanced to acknowledge the evolving activities and objectives of the Merchant Banking Segment. The key drivers of such future valuations are expected to include (i) expected future long-term investment returns, adjusted for Company specific and market driven factors; (ii) expected economic value to be added by the Merchant Banking Segment in addition to such investment returns; (iii) the level of capital accessible by the Merchant Banking Segment; and (iv) other relevant facts and circumstances. To determine the appropriate returns, investment levels and other assumptions for purposes of this analysis, the Company will (i) review the expected or actual returns from transactions that were initiated and/or completed since the last impairment test; (ii) assess the actual economic values added by other Merchant Banking Segment activities since the last impairment test; and (iii) assess the ongoing appropriateness of all assumptions impacting the valuation based on then current conditions and expectations. The Company believes that any model used to value the Merchant Banking Segment will need to take into account the relatively long time horizon required to evaluate the investment returns and other economic value added activities of the Merchant Banking Segment. In the absence of any mitigating valuation factors or triggering events (events that would give rise to a requirement to perform an impairment test), which are described below, the Company believes that a sustained period of approximately three years in which the Merchant Banking Segment actual investment levels, returns or economic values added fall significantly below those levels necessary to support the carrying value of the Merchant Banking Segment would likely result in a reduction of the value assigned to the Merchant Banking Segment growth potential and, in the absence of any offsetting increase in the aggregate fair value of the Merchant Banking Segment other net assets, an impairment of the Merchant Banking Segment goodwill. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining the assumptions and estimates that are used to determine the fair value of the Merchant Banking Segment. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from the corresponding assumptions and estimates. If a triggering event were to occur that could reasonably be expected to result in an impairment of the carrying value of the Merchant Banking Segment, the Company would be required to test the goodwill assigned to the Merchant Banking Segment as of the end of the reporting period in which any such event occurred. The Company believes that triggering events with respect to the Merchant Banking Segment could include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company partial or complete withdrawal of financial support for the Merchant Banking Segment; (ii) a significant reduction in management long-term expectation of the price of gold, given the adverse effect such a development could have on the fair values of the Merchant Banking Segment investment and royalty interest portfolios and the Merchant Banking Segment prospects for future growth; (iii) the divestiture of a significant portion of the Merchant Banking Segment investment portfolio together with management determination not to fund the replenishment of such portfolio for the foreseeable future; and (iv) any other event that might adversely affect the ability of the Merchant Banking Segment to consummate transactions that create value for the Company. The Company currently has no plans to withdraw financial support for the Merchant Banking Segment. For a discussion of the results of operations of the Merchant Banking Segment, see Results of Operations, Merchant Banking Segment, below. 53 Table of Contents Exploration Segment Goodwill The Exploration Segment is responsible for all activities, regardless of location, associated with the Company efforts to discover new mineralized material that will advance into proven and probable reserves. Internally generated proven and probable reserve additions are attributed to the Exploration Segment to the extent that such additions are derived from (i) a discovery made by the Company or Normandy; or (ii) a discovery made on previously acquired properties (whether acquired by the Company or by Normandy, prior to its acquisition by the Company) as a result of exploration efforts conducted subsequent to the acquisition date. The assignment of goodwill to the Exploration Segment was based on the assumption that, following the acquisition of Normandy, the Exploration Segment would continue Normandy historical level of increasing proven and probable reserves through new discoveries by combining Normandy exploration culture, philosophy, expertise and methodologies with those of Newmont. At December 31, 2004, the $1.1 billion carrying value of the Exploration Segment goodwill represented approximately 98% of the carrying value of the total assets of the Exploration Segment. Based on a December 31, 2004 valuation of the Exploration Segment, the Company concluded that the fair value of the Exploration Segment was significantly in excess of its carrying value at December 31, 2004. Based on the review of historical additions to proven and probable reserves and on management expectation of the growth rate and levels of reserve additions that could be expected to continue in the future, the discounted cash flow model developed to value the Exploration Segment at December 31, 2004 assumed that (i) the Exploration Segment would be responsible for 11.0 million ounces of additions to proven and probable reserves in 2005; (ii) such additions would increase by 5% annually; and (iii) approximately 9.1%, 8.7%, 8.3% and 7.9% of additions in years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, would represent ounces that had previously been valued in the Normandy purchase accounting. In addition, the discounted cash flow model for the Exploration Segment assumed, among other matters: (i) a 16-year time horizon, including a seven-year time lapse between additions to proven and probable reserves and the initiation of production and a five-year production period; (ii) discount rate of 8%; (iii) a terminal value of approximately $5.8 billion; (iv) an average gold price of $375 per ounce during the time horizon; (v) total cash costs per ounce of $230; and (vi) capital costs of $50 per ounce. The Company believes that any model used to value the Exploration Segment will need to take into account the relatively long time horizon required to evaluate the activities of the Exploration Segment. As such, in the absence of any mitigating valuation factors, or triggering events which are described below, the Company believes that a sustained period of approximately three years in which additions to proven and probable reserves, or the values associated therewith, fall short of those levels that reasonably could be expected to support the carrying value of the Exploration Segment would likely result in a reduction of the value assigned to the Exploration Segment growth potential and, accordingly, in an impairment of the Exploration Segment goodwill. The Company believes that triggering events with respect to the Exploration Segment could include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company partial or complete withdrawal of financial support for the Exploration Segment; (ii) a significant decrease in the Company long-term expectation of the price of gold; and (iii) a significant increase in long-term capital and operating cost estimates. The Company currently has no plans to withdraw financial support for the Exploration Segment. For a discussion of the results of operations of the Exploration Segment, see Results of Operations, Exploration Segment, below. The assignment of goodwill to mine site reporting units was based on synergies that were expected to be achieved at each operation. Such synergies are expected to be incorporated into the Company operations and business plans over time. The amount of goodwill assigned to each segment or reporting unit was based on discounted cash flow analyses that assumed risk-adjusted discount rates over the remaining lives of the applicable mining operations. The Company believes that triggering events with respect to the goodwill assigned to mine site reporting units could include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant decrease in the Company long-term gold price assumption; (ii) a decrease in reserves; and (iii) any event that might otherwise adversely affect mine site production levels or costs. The Company performed its annual impairment test of mine site goodwill as of December 31, 2004 and determined that, except in the case of its Pajingo reporting unit (Australia/New 54 Table of Contents Zealand Segment) the fair value of each mine site reporting unit was in excess of the relevant carrying value at December 31, 2004. At Pajingo, the Company determined there was an impairment as of December 31, 2004 as a result of increased future operating costs and lower grade ore. For more information on the discounted cash flows used to value mine site reporting units, see Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets, below. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At the Company surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At the Company underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on recoverable ounces to be mined from proven and probable reserves. Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be mined from proven and probable reserves. Depending upon whether the development is expected to benefit the entire remaining ore body, or specific ore blocks or areas only, the UOP basis is either the life of the entire ore body, or the life of the specific ore block or area. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These factors could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual cash costs of mining, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for purpose of depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels and cash costs of production, capital and reclamation costs, all based on detailed life-of-mine engineering plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future discounted cash flows for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2004, apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure 55 Table of Contents assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $375 per ounce and Australian and Canadian dollar exchange rates of $1.43 and $1.30, respectively per U.S.$1.00. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained from proven and probable reserves and all related exploration stage mineral interests, except for other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential discussed separately below, after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. With the exception of other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential, all assets at a particular operation are considered together for purposes of estimating future cash flows. In the case of mineral interests associated with other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential, cash flows and fair values are individually evaluated based primarily on recent exploration results and recent transactions involving sales of similar properties. As discussed above under Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization, various factors could impact the Company ability to achieve its forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, commodity prices, capital expenditure requirements and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material can ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as other mine-related exploration potential and greenfields exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, write-downs of long-lived assets were $39.3 million, $35.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively. See Consolidated Financial Results below for further discussion. Material changes to any of these factors or assumptions discussed above could result in future impairment charges. Deferred Stripping Costs In general, mining costs are allocated to production costs, stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories, and are charged to Costs applicable to sales when gold or copper is sold. However, at certain open pit mines, which have diverse grades and waste-to-ore ratios over the mine life, the Company defers and amortizes certain mining costs on a units-of-production basis over the life of the mine. These mining costs, which are commonly referred to as deferred stripping costs, are incurred in mining activities that are normally associated with the removal of waste rock. The deferred stripping accounting method is generally accepted in the mining industry where mining operations have diverse grades and waste-to-ore ratios; however, industry practice does vary. Deferred stripping matches the costs of production with the sale of such production at the Company operations where it is employed, by assigning each ounce of gold or pound of copper with an equivalent amount of waste removal cost. If the Company were to expense stripping costs as incurred, there might be greater volatility in the Company period-to-period results of operations. The Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) is discussing the accounting for deferred stripping costs but has not yet reached a consensus. The EITF considered the recommendation that stripping costs incurred during production are a mine development cost that should be capitalized as an investment in the mine and attributed to the proven and probable reserves benefited in a systematic and rational manner. However, the EITF directed the FASB staff to develop additional guidance about what constitutes a systematic and rational manner of attributing the capitalized costs to proven and probable reserves benefited. The Company cannot predict whether the deliberations of the EITF will ultimately modify or otherwise result in new accounting standards or interpretations thereof that differ from the Company current practices. 56 Table of Contents Financial Instruments All financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value, with the exception of contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption. Changes in the fair market value of derivatives recorded on the balance sheet are recorded in the statements of consolidated operations, except for the effective portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. The Company portfolio of derivatives includes various complex instruments that are linked to gold prices and other factors. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding gold and other commodity prices, gold lease rates, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to operations to reflect the changes in fair market value of derivatives. In addition, certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair market value of these instruments are deferred in Other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated operations when the underlying production designated as the hedged item is sold. All derivative contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are designated against the applicable portion of future production from proven and probable reserves, where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that such future production is no longer probable of occurring due to changes in the factors impacting the determination of reserves, as discussed above under Depreciation, depletion and amortization , gains and losses deferred in Other comprehensive income would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated operations immediately. Reclamation and Remediation Obligations (Asset Retirement Obligations) The Company mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which established a methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. The statement was adopted January 1, 2003, when the Company recorded the estimated present value of reclamation liabilities and increased the carrying amount of the related asset, which resulted in a charge to cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of $34.5 million. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The reclamation costs will be allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and will be adjusted for changes resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 143, estimated future reclamation costs were based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. Such costs related to active mines were accrued and charged over the expected operating lives of the mines using the UOP method based on proven and probable reserves. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate at the end of each period of the undiscounted costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs the Company will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by the Company. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation. Deferred Tax Assets The Company recognizes the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. 57 Table of Contents Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above under Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could limit the Company ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by its deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. Consolidated Financial Results Sales gold were $3.7 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The period-to-period changes were primarily due to an increase in the average realized gold price and in 2004, the consolidation of Batu Hijau. The following analysis demonstrates the increase in consolidated gold revenue year over year: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Consolidated gold sales (in millions) $ 3,653.6 $ 3,082.9 $ 2,566.9 Consolidated gold ounces sold (in thousands) 8,915.6 8,455.9 8,217.9 Average realized price per ounce of gold $ 412 $ 366 $ 313 Increase (decrease) in consolidated gold sales due to (in millions): 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Changes in ounces sold: Consolidation of Batu Hijau $ 287.7 $ N/A Other (97.1 ) 75.8 Change in average realized gold price 380.1 440.2 $ 570.7 $ 516.0 Sales base metals, net totaled $870.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and included $785.9 million from copper sales at Batu Hijau and $55.3 million from copper sales and $29.4 million from zinc sales at Golden Grove in Australia, all net of smelting and refining charges. Sales base metals, net totaled $74.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which included $53.0 million and $21.9 million from copper and zinc sales at Golden Grove, respectively, net of smelting and refining charges. Sales base metals, net totaled $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, and included $27.6 million from copper sales and $23.3 million from zinc sales at Golden Grove in Australia, all net of smelting and refining charges, and $4.4 million from cobalt sales. The cobalt operation was sold in 2002. The following analysis reflects the increase in consolidated copper revenue year over year: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Consolidated copper sales (in millions) $ 841.2 $ 53.0 $ 27.6 Consolidated copper pounds sold (in millions) 726.7 74.3 44.8 Average realized price per pound of copper $ 1.33 $ 0.86 $ 0.79 Increase (decrease) in consolidated copper sales is due to (in millions): 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Changes in pounds sold: Consolidation of Batu Hijau $ 785.9 $ N/A Other (19.6 ) 20.2 Change in average realized copper price 21.9 5.2 $ 788.2 $ 25.4 58 Table of Contents Total Costs applicable to sales were $2.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as detailed in the table below. The increase from 2003 to 2004 resulted primarily from the consolidation of Batu Hijau and increased costs in Nevada and Australia/New Zealand. Costs applicable to sales gold , which includes total cash costs, accretion of reclamation and remediation liabilities related to consolidated gold production and write-downs of stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories increased to $1.9 billion in 2004 from $1.7 billion in 2003 and $1.6 billion in 2002. Costs applicable to sales base metals were $367.4 million, $44.3 million and $36.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase from 2003 to 2004 resulted primarily from the consolidation of Batu Hijau. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Operations below. The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales by operation: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) North America: Nevada, USA $ 716.3 $ 597.8 $ 657.1 Golden Giant, Canada 47.6 53.4 57.1 Holloway, Canada 24.7 20.8 20.4 Mesquite, California 9.3 10.1 La Herradura, Mexico 10.1 11.1 11.5 798.7 692.4 756.2 South America: Yanacocha, Peru 432.6 362.5 302.0 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 9.8 35.6 46.6 442.4 398.1 348.6 Australia/New Zealand: Pajingo, Australia 59.4 42.9 30.5 Yandal, Australia 105.9 158.7 136.4 Tanami, Australia 194.2 148.9 111.5 Kalgoorlie, Australia 140.9 108.4 85.0 Martha, New Zealand 28.1 24.9 19.6 Golden Grove, Australia 61.8 43.5 27.7 590.3 527.3 410.7 Indonesia: Batu Hijau 395.9 Minahasa 19.8 26.3 41.2 415.7 26.3 41.2 Central Asia: Zarafshan, Uzbekistan 32.4 32.9 34.0 Ovacik, Turkey 22.9 22.3 17.5 55.3 55.2 51.5 Africa 7.8 Other: Merchant Banking 0.8 0.8 0.5 Corporate and Other 0.2 (0.1 ) 0.8 1.0 0.4 $ 2,303.2 $ 1,700.3 $ 1,616.4 59 Table of Contents Deferred stripping.

Details of deferred stripping with respect to certain of the Company open pit mines are as follows: Nevada (4) La Herradura (5) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Life-of-mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 126.5 125.0 125.1 149.1 146.4 141.3 Average ore grade (2) 0.051 0.049 0.073 0.034 0.030 0.031 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (1) 154.3 124.9 72.2 156.1 157.4 158.5 Average ore grade (2) 0.059 0.075 0.081 0.026 0.026 0.026 Remaining Mine Life (years) (3) 10 9 10 4 5 6 Tanami (6) Kalgoorlie (7) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Life-of-mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 82.3 48.8 68.2 110.9 114.8 111.5 Average ore grade (2) 0.160 0.160 0.113 0.061 0.065 0.065 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (1) 52.3 63.5 86.4 102.9 112.2 131.0 Average ore grade (2) 0.130 0.108 0.107 0.063 0.063 0.054 Remaining Mine Life (years) (3) 1 1 2 13 13 14 Martha (8) Ovacik (9) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Life-of-mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 26.1 32.1 31.7 41.6 34.9 28.9 Average ore grade (2) 0.107 0.103 0.093 0.385 0.356 0.362 Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (1) 31.7 29.5 36.6 57.0 40.4 32.1 Average ore grade (2) 0.091 0.089 0.100 0.298 0.374 0.358 Remaining Mine Life (years) (3) 3 3 4 2 2 3 Batu Hijau (10) 2004 2003 2002 Life-of-mine Assumptions Used as Basis For Deferred Stripping Calculations Stripping ratio (1) 0.22 N/A N/A Average ore grade (2) 4.63 N/A N/A Actuals for Year Stripping ratio (1) 0.16 N/A N/A Average ore grade (2) 6.22 N/A N/A Remaining Mine Life (years) (3) 14 N/A N/A 60 Table of Contents (1) Total tons to be mined in future divided by total ounces of gold or total pounds of copper equivalent to be recovered in future, based on proven and probable reserves. Pounds of copper equivalent equate to copper pounds plus gold ounces converted to copper pounds on an equivalent revenue basis. (2) Total tons mined divided by total ounces of gold recovered or total pounds of copper equivalent recovered. (3) Remaining mine life (years) is as of January 1 st of the year being presented and is based on the then current life-of-mine plan. (4) The actual stripping ratio increased in 2004 from 2003 and is greater than life-of-mine due to increased waste removal from Section 30 at Twin Creeks. The actual grade decreased in 2004 as lower grade ore zones are being mined at Twin Creeks and Carlin. (5) La Herradura is included in the Company Other North America reportable segment. (6) The life-of-mine stripping ratio increased during 2004 from 2003 due to changes in mine plans as production winds down. The actual stripping ratio decreased during 2004 from 2003 due to the completion of several low-grade remnant pits. The one-year mine life is for open pit only. Underground mine life is six years. Tanami is included in the Company Australia/New Zealand reportable segment. (7) The actual stripping ratio decreased in 2004 due to fewer waste tons being moved. Kalgoorlie is included in the Company Australia/New Zealand reportable segment. (8) The actual life-of mine stripping ratio decreased in 2004 due to a positive grade reconciliation in 2003. Martha is included in the Company Australia/New Zealand reportable segment. (9) The life-of-mine stripping ratio increased in 2004 due to a change in mining method for certain reserves from underground to open pit. The actual stripping ratio increased significantly from 2003 due to accelerated waste removal required to maintain higher mill throughput. The life-of-mine grade increased as higher grade material will be mined due to change from underground to open pit. The actual grade decreased as lower grade areas are still being mined. Ovacik is included in the Company Central Asia reportable segment. (10) The actual stripping ratio is significantly lower than the life-of-mine stripping ratio as a direct result of mining higher ore grade in 2004 than the life-of-mine average. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) was $696.5 million, $564.5 million and $505.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 primarily resulted from the consolidation of Batu Hijau and significant capital expenditures in recent years at Yanacocha. The increase in 2003 was attributable to a decrease in the estimated useful lives of certain assets (primarily in Nevada) and an increase in the depreciable base. DD&A expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease. For a complete discussion, see Results of Operations, below. Newmont expects DD&A to be approximately $700 million to $730 million in 2005. 61 Table of Contents The following is a summary of Depreciation, depletion and amortization by operation: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) North America: Nevada, USA $ 126.8 $ 137.7 $ 118.2 Golden Giant, Canada 11.4 22.0 20.5 Holloway, Canada 7.0 5.3 6.7 Mesquite, California 3.9 6.3 La Herradura, Mexico 5.0 3.4 3.1 150.2 172.3 154.8 South America: Yanacocha, Peru 198.0 160.4 121.5 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 2.3 6.8 13.8 200.3 167.2 135.3 Australia/New Zealand: Pajingo, Australia 31.4 29.2 20.6 Yandal, Australia 26.8 35.8 43.5 Tanami, Australia 37.9 36.0 33.7 Kalgoorlie, Australia 16.2 9.8 9.0 Martha, New Zealand 13.8 11.5 13.9 Golden Grove, Australia 28.2 29.1 22.9 Other, Australia 4.2 5.3 3.4 158.5 156.7 147.0 Indonesia: Batu Hijau 117.5 Minahasa 2.4 7.6 9.5 Martabe 0.2 0.8 0.7 120.1 8.4 10.2 Central Asia: Zarafshan, Uzbekistan 10.3 10.1 10.3 Ovacik, Turkey 18.6 13.9 11.5 Other 0.1 0.1 0.1 29.0 24.1 21.9 Africa 0.8 1.7 Other: Merchant Banking 24.3 26.5 22.6 Corporate and Other 13.3 7.6 13.8 37.6 34.1 36.4 $ 696.5 $ 564.5 $ 505.6 Exploration, research and development was $192.4 million, $115.2 million and $88.9 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The period-to-period increases reflect increased exploration and related activity in response to higher prevailing gold and copper prices and increased spending on advanced projects, feasibility studies and exploration drilling at Martabe, Akyem, Minas Conga and Ahafo. Newmont expects Exploration, research and development expenses to be approximately $170 million to $200 million in 2005. 62 Table of Contents General and administrative was $115.8 million, $130.3 million and $115.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in 2004 from 2003 resulted from an increase in the allocation of costs incurred by corporate to the individual operations in 2004, partially offset by an increase in consulting fees and costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The increase in 2003 from 2002 was attributable to increased pension and other employee benefit-related expenses and increased compliance and corporate governance costs. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was 2.5% in 2004, compared to 4.1% in 2003 and 4.3% in 2002. Newmont expects General and administrative expenses to be approximately $115 million to $125 million in 2005. Write-down of goodwill of $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 was related to the Pajingo operation in Australia as a result of anticipated increased future operating costs and lower grade ore. Write-down of long-lived assets totaled $39.3 million, $35.3 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 write-down included $16.3 million related to the Ovacik mine in Turkey. In August 2004, the Ovacik mine temporarily suspended operations as a result of a court decision ordering the suspension of operating permits pending completion of certain additional permitting requirements and the submission of an updated environmental impact assessment. On March 1, 2005, the Ovacik mine was sold to a subsidiary of Koza Davetiye, a Turkish conglomerate. The remainder of the write-down for 2004 was primarily related to exploration tenements in Australia, reevaluation of future production and operating costs at Pajingo, and processing facilities at Yanacocha. The 2003 write-down primarily related to a $28.4 million impairment charge at Golden Giant and the mobile fleet at Yanacocha. The impairment charge at Golden Giant resulted from a reevaluation of the life-of-mine plan that eliminated marginal stopes and reflected higher projected life-of-mine operating costs due to a stronger Canadian dollar and higher power and labor costs, which led to reduced proven and probable reserves and increased life-of-mine operating costs. The 2002 write-down related to an impairment charge for exploration stage mineral interests and fixed assets at Kori Kollo. For a discussion of the Company policy for assessing the carrying value of its goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, see Critical Accounting Policies, above. Other expenses in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $34.4 million, $49.5 million and $29.4 million, respectively. The 2004 expense related to the closure of Minahasa, care and maintenance charges at Ovacik, engineering and permitting expenses for the power plant in Nevada and other miscellaneous expenses. The 2003 expense included additions to reclamation and remediation liabilities related to depleted ore bodies, an accrual for certain environmental obligations, costs associated with the finalization of a de-watering agreement in Nevada, severance costs at the Kori Kollo project in Bolivia, and costs related to compliance and governance implementation activities. The 2002 expenses primarily included integration costs relating to the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada and costs associated with employee severance benefits. Loss on investments, net was $39.0 million in 2004 and was primarily attributable to the impairment of our investment in Kinross for an other-than-temporary decline in market value in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Gain on investments, net was $83.2 million and $47.1 million for years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2003 gain was primarily related to the exchange of Echo Bay shares for Kinross shares. The 2002 gain was primarily related to Newmont sale of its investment in Lihir Gold Limited. Gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net, representing non-cash, mark-to-market gains and losses recognized on ineffective and partially ineffective derivative instruments, was $2.4 million, $22.9 million and $(39.8) million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 2004 involved a $0.7 million loss due to the ineffectiveness of gold put option cash flow hedges caused by rising gold prices and a $3.1 million gain due to undesignated interest rate swap contracts and the ineffectiveness of interest rate swap 63 Table of Contents fair value hedges on Newmont bonds. The 2003 gain primarily related to the acquired Normandy gold hedge books and resulted predominantly from a strengthening of the Australian dollar, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. dollar gold price. The loss in 2002 primarily related to the acquired Normandy gold hedge books and resulted from the increase in the U.S. dollar gold price, partially offset by the appreciation of the Australian dollar. The Company substantially eliminated the acquired Normandy hedge books as of December 31, 2003. Gain on extinguishment of NYOL liabilities, net was $220.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In 2003, Newmont acquired all of NYOL outstanding 8 7 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2008 and all of NYOL gold hedge contracts from the relevant counterparties. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $0.2 million and $33.8 million for years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2003, Newmont repurchased $148.0 million of its 8 3 / 8 % debentures, $52.3 million of its 8 5 / 8 % debentures, $80.5 million of Newmont Australia 7 1 / 2 % guaranteed notes, $30.9 million of Newmont Australia 7 5 / 8 % guaranteed notes and 100% of its 6% convertible subordinated debentures for total cash consideration of $445.6 million. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, Financing Activities . Royalty and dividend income totaled $65.8 million, $56.3 million and $35.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase from period-to-period was primarily attributable to higher gold and oil and gas prices. 2004 income also increased as a result of distributions received from the Company approximate 6.6% interest in Canadian Oil Sands Trust, which was acquired during the second and third quarters of 2004. Interest income, foreign currency exchange and other income was $76.9 million, $102.2 million and $39.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Interest income $ 23,366 $ 10,538 $ 14,139 Foreign currency exchange gain, net 9,213 96,971 14,020 Gain on sale of mining and exploration properties 28,004 15,394 6,112 Gain (loss) on QMC debt guarantee 10,616 (30,000 ) Other 5,749 9,279 5,614 $ 76,948 $ 102,182 $ 39,885 The increase in interest income in 2004 from 2003 resulted from higher cash balances held in short-term investments. As of December 31, 2003, the Company converted CDN$499 million of intercompany loans with a subsidiary whose functional currency is the Canadian dollar, to long-term notes, as the Company does not intend to settle these loans in the foreseeable future. As a result, the Company no longer records foreign currency gains and losses in earnings with respect to the converted long-term notes. The year ended December 31, 2003 foreign currency exchange gain included: (i) exchange gains, net of $58.9 million on the Canadian dollar-denominated intercompany loans reflecting a strengthening of the Canadian dollar during the period; (ii) a $27.4 million mark-to-market gain on ineffective foreign currency swaps; (iii) a $19.2 million foreign currency gain on the translation of Newmont Australia Limited financial statements to U.S. dollars; and (iv) other foreign currency losses of $8.5 million. The 2004 gain on sale of mining and exploration properties primarily resulted from the sale of Perama, Midwest Uranium and Bronzewing. The 2003 gain resulted from the sale of Mesquite and Wiluna. 64 Table of Contents Newmont was the guarantor of an A$71.0 million (approximately $53.2 million) amortizing loan facility of QMC Finance Pty Ltd. ( QMC ) which was collateralized by the assets of the Queensland Magnesium Project. Newmont reduced the amount accrued for this contingent obligation by the estimated fair value of the AMC assets that would be subrogated to Newmont in the event the guarantee was called, which resulted in a $30.0 million loss during the fourth quarter of 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2004, Newmont Australia Limited ( NAL ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newmont, entered into a transaction resulting in a loan from NAL to a subsidiary of QMC for A$30.0 million (approximately $23.2 million), the release of Newmont from its guarantee obligation and recognition of a $10.6 million gain resulting from the release of all previously accrued contingent liabilities. An allowance was provided for 100% of the loan receivable from the QMC entity. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was $97.6 million, $88.6 million and $129.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $13.1 million, $8.9 million and $5.2 million in each year, respectively. Net interest increased during 2004 as compared to 2003 as a result of the consolidation of Batu Hijau. Net interest expense declined during 2003 from 2002 primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt resulting from Newmont debt-reduction strategy. Income tax expense was $275.9 million in 2004, compared to $206.9 million and $19.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in income tax expense in 2004, compared to 2003, was primarily attributable to $173.6 million higher Pre-tax income before minority interest, equity income and impairments of affiliates and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle ( pre-tax income ). The Company effective tax rates were 25.1%, 22.4%, and 9.2% in 2004, 2003 and 2002 based on pre-tax income of $1.1 billion, $925.4 million, and $216.3 million, respectively. The factors that most significantly impact the Company effective tax rate are metal prices, percentage depletion and resource allowances, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to minority interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, foreign currency translation gains and losses, changes in tax laws and the impact of certain specific transactions. Most of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed the Company tax basis in its mineral reserves) are available to the Company under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in the Company consolidated United States income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company. For 2004 and prior years, similar types of deductions are available for mining operations in Canada and are referred to as resource allowances. The tax benefits from percentage depletion and resource allowances were $47.1 million, $21.5 million and $34.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 compared to the other periods resulted primarily from the inclusion of $13.8 million of additional tax savings from percentage depletion deductions realized when the Company filed its 2003 income tax return. Additional increases in percentage depletion allowances were also realized due to an increase in the Company average realized gold price. On October 22, 2004, the President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( the Act ). The Act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. In return, the Act also provides for a two-year phase-out of the existing extra-territorial income exclusion (ETI) for foreign sales. The Company expects the net effect of the phase out of the ETI and the phase in of this new deduction to result in a minimal change in the effective tax rate for the phase in years 2005 and 2006, based on current earnings levels. In the longer term, the Company expects that the tax benefit therefrom will result in a decrease of the annual effective tax rate of less than 1 percentage point based on current earnings levels. Under the guidance in FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in FASB Statement No. 109. As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at 65 Table of Contents the enactment date. Rather the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed. The Company operates in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. Many of these differences combine to move the Company overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the United States statutory rate. The effect of these differences is shown in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as either a rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings, net of credits. Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations make the Company ability to fully utilize all of its available foreign income tax credits on a year-by-year basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper produced by the Company, since lower prices can result in the Company having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carryback and carryforward periods and can only be used to reduce the United States income tax imposed on the Company foreign earnings included in its annual United States consolidated income tax return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable credits, were an increase of income tax expense of $11.0 million in 2004, and reductions of income tax expense of $27.8 million and $16.7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company separately stated in its effective income tax rate reconciliation under Change in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets a benefit of $49.1 million resulting from the utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards for which a valuation allowance previously had been recorded. This utilization primarily was caused by the realization of higher sources of taxable income in the United States resulting from the increase in the Company average realized gold price in 2004. The effect of different income tax rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested contributed to an increase in the Company income tax expense of $16.3 million and $5.0 million in 2004 and 2002 respectively, and a decrease in income tax expense of $13.4 million in 2003. The tax effect of changes in local country tax laws as set forth as a separate item in the Company effective tax reconciliation in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted in a net tax benefit of $51.4 million and $35.7 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The net tax benefit is primarily related to a change in tax law in Australia that allows the Company to consolidate wholly-owned subsidiaries in that country. The need to record valuation allowances related to the Company deferred tax assets (primarily attributable to net operating losses and tax credits) is principally dependent on the following factors: (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit; (ii) the Company long-term estimate of future average realized minerals prices; and (iii) the degree to which many of the tax laws and income tax agreements imposed upon the Company and its subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax deductions early in the mining process. These up-front deductions can give rise to net operating losses and credit carryforwards in circumstances where future sources of taxable income may not coincide with available carryforward periods even after taking into account all available tax planning strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities accrued for financial reporting purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could happen after mining operations have ceased, when sufficient sources of taxable income may not be available. Changes to valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by $58.6 million and $85.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and increased income tax expense in 2002 by $2.5 million. As noted above, $49.1 million of the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods with respect to the Company foreign tax credits was included in the total change in the valuation allowance for 2004. Partially offsetting these reductions in valuation allowances was the need to record valuation allowances for currently arising tax losses incurred by some of the Company foreign subsidiaries. The Company, for financial reporting purposes, consolidates subsidiaries of which it does not own 100% of the outstanding equity. However, for tax purposes, the Company only is responsible for the income taxes on the portion of the taxable earnings attributable to its ownership interest of each consolidated entity. Such minority interests contributed $7.3 million, $22.2 million and $11.5 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as reductions in the Company income tax expense. The Company effective tax in 2004 decreased by $12.7 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared with an increase of $54.4 million in 2003. In 2004 and 2003, these amounts primarily relate to the Australian tax effect of realized and unrealized translation gains attributable to United States dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and the gold derivatives positions at Newmont Australia Limited whose 66 Table of Contents functional currency is the United States dollar. Because Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from Newmont Australia Limited, no offsetting United States deferred income tax effect can be provided. The effect in 2004 differed from 2003 because of the significant strengthening of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar that took place primarily in 2003. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing the Company effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, Newmont effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. Minority interest in income of subsidiaries was $335.3 million, $173.2 million and $97.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 increase from 2003 resulted from the recording of the minority interest in Batu Hijau which was consolidated in 2004 (see Accounting Changes, above), and increased earnings at Yanacocha due to increased gold price and ounces sold, partially offset by an increase in costs. The 2003 increase from 2002 was primarily a result of increased earnings at Yanacocha, due to higher gold prices, increased gold sales and lower production costs (see Results of Operations, South American Operations). Equity loss and impairment of Australian Magnesium Corporation ( AMC ) was $119.5 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded losses of $119.5 million related to its investment in AMC composed of the following: (i) losses of $0.7 million representing Newmont proportionate share of AMC 2003 losses; (ii) second quarter 2003 losses resulting from a restructuring agreement of (a) $72.7 million representing the book value of its investment at June 30, 2003; (b) $24.8 million related to a loan receivable from AMC; (c) $10.0 million charge to settle Newmont guarantee of the obligation payable by AMC to Ford Motor Credit; (d) $6.6 million related to a contingent credit facility; and (e) $1.1 million related to various other items, offset by a $7.4 million income tax benefit; and (iii) a first quarter 2003 loss for an other-than-temporary decline in value of the investment of approximately $11.0 million. During December 2003, Newmont sold its interest in AMC. Equity income of affiliates was $2.6 million, $84.4 million and $53.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following table indicates equity income (loss) by affiliate: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Batu Hijau $ $ 82,892 $ 42,119 TVX Newmont Americas 810 9,737 Echo Bay (380 ) European Gold Refineries 1,224 AGR Matthey Joint Venture 1,417 725 1,675 $ 2,641 $ 84,427 $ 53,151 The decrease in 2004 from 2003 primarily resulted from the consolidation of Batu Hijau effective January 1, 2004. See Accounting Changes, above, for more information. The 2003 increase from 2002 related to Batu Hijau resulted primarily from higher copper prices, increased gold by-product credits and lower smelting and refining costs. Newmont recorded charges (benefit) for the Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax of $47.1 million, $34.5 million and $(7.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The 2004 charge resulted from the consolidation of Batu Hijau to conform Batu Hijau accounting policies to Newmont accounting policies. The 2003 charge reflects the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, that changed the method of accounting for the Company estimated mine reclamation and abandonment costs. The 2002 benefit related to a change in depreciation, 67 Table of Contents depletion and amortization of Property, plant and mine development, net to exclude future estimated development costs expected to be incurred for certain underground operations. See Accounting Changes, above, for more information. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in 2004 primarily included a $123.1 million gain in value of marketable equity securities and a $30.7 million gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, offset by losses of $11.1 million related to a minimum pension liability adjustment and $18.9 million for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax , in 2003, primarily included a $68.4 million gain on the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges and a $23.2 million gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, partially offset by a loss of $5.0 million related to a decline in value of marketable equity securities. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax , in 2002, primarily included losses of $28.7 million related to a minimum pension liability adjustment, $16.7 million for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and $12.8 million related to a decline in value of marketable equity securities.

Batu Hijau was accounted for using the equity method in 2003 and 2002, and as a result was not included in the weighted-average total cash cost per ounce for such years. Disclosure of total cash costs per ounce is intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacities of Newmont mining operations. Newmont management uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring the performance of its gold mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. This measure was developed in conjunction with gold mining companies associated with the Gold Institute, a non-profit industry group no longer in existence, in an effort to provide a level of comparability; however, Newmont measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. For all periods presented, total cash costs include charges for mining ore and waste associated with current period gold and copper production, processing ore through milling and leaching facilities, by-product credits, production taxes, royalties and other cash costs. Certain gold mines produce silver as a by-product. Proceeds from the sale of by-products are reflected as credits to total cash costs. With the exception of Yanacocha and Golden Grove, such by-product sales have not been significant to the economics or profitability of the Company mining operations. All of these charges and by-product credits are included in Costs applicable to sales. Charges for reclamation are also included in Costs applicable to sales, but are not included in total cash costs. Reclamation charges are included in total production costs, together with total cash costs and Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Total production costs provide an indication of earnings before interest expense and taxes for Newmont share of gold mining properties, when taking into account the average realized price 68 Table of Contents received for gold sold, as this measure combines Costs applicable to sales plus Depreciation, depletion and amortization, net of minority interest. A reconciliation of total cash costs and total production costs to Costs applicable to sales in total and by segment is provided in Item 2, Properties, Operating Statistics. The Company expects that gold production will range between 6.6 million and 6.8 million equity ounces in 2005 and will range between 6.5 million and 7.0 million equity ounces per year through 2007.

North America sold 7% fewer equity ounces of gold in 2004 when compared to 2003 and 10% fewer equity ounces in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily because of lower sales from Nevada and Golden Giant and the sale of Mesquite in November 2003. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 19% due to the decrease in production caused by lower grades in Nevada. In 2003, total cash costs per equity ounce increased 6% from 2002 primarily due to lower production. Nevada . Gold equity ounces sold in 2004 decreased 3% from 2003 as sales from inventories partially offset a 9% production decline. Production declines in 2004 were due to lower ore grade and recoveries, partially offset by increased mill throughput. The increase in throughput was due to the Gold Quarry expansion and a full year of production from Mill 5, which recommenced operations in June 2003. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 18%, primarily due to the processing of lower-grade material, higher contract service costs from contracted ore haulage at Carlin, increased tonnage hauled to Twin Creeks and higher diesel, electricity and mine equipment maintenance costs. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold decreased 9% from 2002, primarily due to a decline in oxide mill production, timing of material placed on leach pads and a build up of inventory. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 4% over 2002, primarily due to the decrease in ounces sold and higher labor, mine maintenance, electricity, diesel and contract mining costs. Nevada expects to sell approximately 2.6 million equity ounces of gold in 2005 at total cash costs of $285 per equity ounce. Newmont is in the process of obtaining permits for construction and operation of a 203-megawatt coal-fired power plant to be located near Carlin, Nevada. If all of the necessary permits and approvals are obtained and construction commences in 2005, the plant could begin commercial operations in late 2007 or early 2008. Preliminary estimates of capital expenditures for the project are approximately $400 million - $450 million. Operation of the plant could result in savings of up to $20 in total cash costs per ounce of gold produced by the Nevada operations. Non-governmental organizations have brought a series of actions relating to the Nevada operations, as described in more detail in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While Newmont believes that the legal actions are without merit, unfavorable outcomes could result in additional conditions being imposed on how the Company conducts operations, and such conditions could have a material adverse effect on Nevada results of operations or financial position. 69 Table of Contents Golden Giant, Canada . Gold equity ounces sold decreased 30% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to reduced mining faces at this mature mine. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 31% in 2004 from 2003, primarily from lower production and appreciation of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar (see Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, below). Gold equity ounces sold decreased 18% in 2003 from 2002, primarily due to a 35% decrease in mill throughput as a result of reduced mining faces partially offset by a 35% higher ore grade. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 16% in 2003 from 2002, primarily from lower production volume and appreciation of the Canadian dollar. During 2003, Golden Giant recorded an impairment charge of $28.4 million resulting from a reevaluation of the life-of-mine plan that reduced proven and probable reserves. Gold sales for 2005 are expected to total approximately 160,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $305 per equity ounce. Based on the current mine plans, operations are expected to be completed in early 2006. Holloway, Canada. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 18% in 2004 from 2003, resulting from higher costs associated with increased manpower, steel, electricity and appreciation of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar (see Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, below), partially offset by a 4% increase in gold equity ounces sold. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold decreased 33% from 2002, primarily due to a 20% decline in mill ore grade compared to 2002. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 53% as a result of declining production and a strengthening Canadian dollar. Holloway is expected to sell approximately 85,000 equity ounces in 2005 at total cash costs of $355 per equity ounce. Gold sales are projected to remain at that level in 2006. La Herradura, Mexico . Gold equity ounces sold increased 1% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due a 3% increase in ore placed on the leach pads. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold increased 6% over 2002, primarily due to capital investments that led to increased mining rates and ore placement on the leach pads. La Herradura is expected to sell approximately 80,000 equity ounces in 2005 at total cash costs of $150 per equity ounce. South American Operations Equity Ozs.

Gold equity ounces sold increased 6% in 2004 over 2003, primarily due to increased leach solution processing capacity including greater pumping capacity and additional carbon columns. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 13%, primarily due to an increase in workers participation payments resulting from higher taxable income, higher diesel fuel consumption and price, increased consumption of reagents and higher royalties due to increased gold prices. The increases were partially offset by increased silver by-product credits. By-product credits for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $24.4 million, $14.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold increased 25% from 2002, primarily due to increased leach solution processing capacity and an 18% higher ore grade due to a planned mining sequence leading to higher ore grades at the La Quinua and Cerro Yanacocha pits. Total cash costs per equity ounce decreased 4%, primarily due to the 70 Table of Contents increase in production and increased silver by-product credits, partially offset by higher workers participation payments due to higher taxable income, higher diesel fuel costs and higher royalties due to increased gold prices. Yanacocha is expected to sell approximately 1.5 million equity ounces in 2005 at total cash costs of $135 per equity ounce. Gold equity ounces sold are expected to decline by approximately 10% in 2006, after which gold equity ounces sold can be expected to decline significantly, unless additional oxide deposits are discovered and developed or feasibility studies to develop sulfide deposits are completed. During 2004, Peru enacted legislation to establish a sliding scale mining royalty of up to 3% based on the volume of mine production. The royalty is calculated on revenue from sales of product less certain refining and transportation expenses. While the Peruvian royalty became effective during the second quarter of 2004, it does not apply to those projects that had tax stabilization agreements prior to the adoption of the royalty law. Virtually all of Yanacocha current production is derived from projects that were stabilized prior to the enactment of the royalty legislation. However, pending amendment or successful legal challenges to the validity of the royalty legislation, future projects not covered by the tax stabilization agreements could be burdened by this royalty. Cerro Quilish is one deposit within the Yanacocha complex. In July 2004, Yanacocha received a drilling permit for the Cerro Quilish deposit and commenced drilling activities to further define the deposit. During September 2004, individuals from the Cajamarca region, where Cerro Quilish is located, conducted a sustained blockade of the road between the City of Cajamarca and the mine site, in protest of these exploration activities. Yanacocha suspended all drilling activities at Cerro Quilish and the blockade was resolved. At the request of Yanacocha, the Cerro Quilish drilling permit was revoked in November 2004. Yanacocha has reassessed the challenges involved in obtaining required permits for Cerro Quilish primarily related to increased community concerns. Based upon this reassessment, Yanacocha has reclassified 3.9 million ounces (1.98 million equity ounces) of gold from proven and probable reserves to mineralized material not in reserve as of December 31, 2004. Kori Kollo, Bolivia . Mining was completed and the mill was closed in October 2003. Production has continued from residual leaching. Kori Kollo will begin processing oxide ores on leach pads from the Kori Chaca pit and reprocessing high-grade tailings on a new leach pad in 2005. These projects are expected to produce 85,000 equity ounces in 2005 at total cash costs of $150 per equity ounce. Australia/New Zealand Operations Gold Equity Ozs.

Australia/New Zealand operations sold 5% fewer equity ounces of gold in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily because of lower production from Pajingo and Yandal due to the sale of Wiluna in December 2003 and Bronzewing in the third quarter of 2004. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold increased 11% compared to 2002, primarily due to a full year of Newmont ownership in 2003 compared to ten and one-half months in 2002. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased in 2004 compared to 2003 and in 2003 compared to 2002 by 16% and 24%, respectively, due to appreciation of the Australian and New Zealand dollars compared to the U.S. dollar (see Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, below) and the decrease in ounces sold in 2004. Pajingo, Australia . Gold equity ounces sold decreased 24% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a 33% decline in ore grade and a ground disturbance that delayed mill feed. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 78%, primarily due to the lower ore grade resulting in lower production, increased mine maintenance costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar. During the fourth quarter of 2004, Pajingo recorded goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charges of $51.8 million and $5.8 million, respectively, as a result of anticipated increased future operating costs and lower grade ore. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold increased 11% from 2002, primarily due to a 13% increase in ore grade and a full year of Newmont operations. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 36%, primarily due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar, increased development activity and increased overhead charges. Gold sales for 2005 are expected to be approximately 205,000 ounces at total cash costs of $250 per equity ounce. Based on current mine plans, gold equity ounces sold are expected to decline each year to approximately 55,000 ounces in 2008 as the project approaches the end of its life. Yandal, Australia . Gold equity ounces sold decreased 33% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a 46% decrease in mill throughput, partially offset by an 8% increase in mill ore grade. Jundee is the remaining active mine of the Yandal operations after the sale of the Wiluna operation in December 2003 and the cessation of mining at Bronzewing during the first quarter of 2004. Newmont sold Bronzewing in the third quarter of 2004 (see Other Investing Activities, below). Total cash costs per equity ounce remained the same as the appreciation of the Australian dollar was offset by production coming mainly from the lower cost Jundee operation. Gold equity ounces sold decreased 7% in 2003 from 2002, primarily from a 7% decrease in mill ore grade driven by lower grades at all three sites, partially offset by a full year of Newmont operations in 2003. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 27%, primarily due to higher operating costs related to increased underground activities at Jundee and Wiluna and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. Gold sales for 2005 are expected to be approximately 325,000 ounces at total cash costs of $300 per ounce. Sales for 2005 through 2009 are expected to vary between 235,000 and 325,000 equity ounces per year. Tanami, Australia . Gold equity ounces sold increased 12% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a decrease in inventory and the increase in ownership from 85.9% to 100% in April 2003. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 17%, primarily due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar, higher royalties due to increased gold prices and additional backfill costs underground. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold increased 30% over 2002, primarily due to a full year of Newmont operations, the April 2003 increase in ownership percentage and a 19% increase in mill throughput. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 17%, primarily due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar, higher royalties due to higher gold prices, increases in milling costs and higher overhead charges. 72 Table of Contents Gold sales for 2005 are expected to be approximately 475,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $295 per ounce. Kalgoorlie, Australia . Gold equity ounces sold increased 16% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a decrease in inventory. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 13%, primarily due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar, higher amortization of deferred stripping costs, increased diesel fuel prices and higher processing consumables costs. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold increased 25% from 2002, primarily due to a 15% increase in mill throughput and an 18% increase in mill ore grade, as well as having a full year of Newmont operations. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 22%, primarily due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar, higher amortization of deferred stripping and an increase in underground mining activity at Mt. Charlotte. The increased costs were partially offset by increased gold equity ounces sold. Gold sales for 2005 are expected to be approximately 440,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $335 per equity ounce. Martha, New Zealand . Gold equity ounces sold increased 20% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a 16% increase in mill ore grade and the increase in ownership from 92.28% to 100% in April 2003. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 7%, primarily due to the appreciation of the New Zealand dollar. Gold equity ounces sold in 2003 increased by only 1% compared to 2002, despite the fact that 2002 included only ten and one-half months of production. This is attributable to a 13% decline in mill ore grade in 2003, partially offset by an 18% increase in mill throughput. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 28%, primarily due to the appreciation of the New Zealand dollar, increased milling costs from higher electricity rates, higher consumption of grinding media, an earlier than planned SAG mill liner replacement and higher cyanide and lime consumption. Gold sales for 2005 are expected to be approximately 140,000 equity ounces at total cash costs of $225 per equity ounce. Gold equity ounces sold are expected to remain relatively constant until 2009. Golden Grove, Australia . Copper sales decreased by 41% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due lower grade and higher inventory sales in 2003. Zinc sales increased by 10%, primarily due to a 10% increase in ore processed and a decrease in inventory, partially offset by lower grade. Total cash costs per equity pound of copper and zinc increased 53% and 100%, respectively, primarily from lower copper and zinc grades, higher ground support costs and the appreciation of the Australian dollar. In 2003, copper sales increased 66% over 2002, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments. Lead, silver and gold by-product credits at Golden Grove totaled $15.7 million, $15.5 million and $16.0 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As Golden Grove has a poly-metallic ore body, such by-product credits are expected to continue in the future and to vary from period-to-period based on the portions of the ore body being extracted at the time. Golden Grove is expected to sell approximately 40 to 50 million equity pounds of copper at total cash costs per equity pound of $1.00 to $1.05 and approximately 200 to 220 million equity pounds of zinc at total cash costs per equity pound of $0.30 to $0.35 in 2005. 73 Table of Contents Indonesian Operations Equity Ozs.

Co-product accounting for copper and gold includes production costs identifiable for each product (royalties, freight, smelting and refining) and allocates the remaining costs in proportion to the sales revenue generated by each product. (2) Newmont economic interest decreased to 52.875% from 56.25% on October 1, 2004. (3) Batu Hijau was accounted for using the equity method in 2003 and 2002, and was not included in the weighted-average total cash costs per ounce for such years. Batu Hijau . During 2003 and 2002, Newmont accounted for its 56.25% economic interest (a 45% ownership interest) in Batu Hijau under the equity method of accounting (see Equity Investments, below). Upon adoption of FIN 46R, Newmont consolidated the operations of Batu Hijau as of January 1, 2004 (see Overview, above). As of October 1, 2004, Batu Hijau cumulative losses had been recovered and Batu Hijau began to report positive retained earnings, allowing for the payment of dividends, 6% of which are paid to the minority partner. Accordingly, Newmont began recognizing the minority interests in Batu Hijau at 47.125% (effective 52.875% Newmont share) of Batu Hijau earnings and will continue to do so until a loan to the minority interest partner is fully repaid (including accrued interest). See Consolidated Financial Results above for more information. Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 15%, by the end of 2005; 23%, by the end of 2006; 30%, by the end of 2007; 37%, by the end of 2008; 44%, by the end of 2009; and 51%, by the end of 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares of the project company would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest in the project company as a going concern. An Indonesian national currently owns a 20% interest in Batu Hijau, which would require Newmont and Sumitomo to offer a 3% interest in Batu Hijau to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals in 2006. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in Batu Hijau could be reduced to 49% by the end of 2010. Copper and gold sales quantities increased 12% and 22% in 2004 from 2003, respectively. The increases were primarily attributable to higher mill throughput reflecting modifications to the crusher circuit in the second half of 2003 and higher ore grades (copper 5%, gold 10%). Beginning in 2004, Newmont began utilizing co-product accounting for copper and gold whereby sales and costs applicable to sales are recognized for each product. During 2003 and 2002, Batu Hijau accounted for sales 74 Table of Contents of gold as a by-product credit to copper production costs. On a co-product basis, copper and gold total cash costs per equity pound of copper and ounce of gold increased 30% and 6%, respectively in 2004, due to higher diesel fuel consumption and price, higher equipment maintenance costs, increased mill throughput and higher insurance costs. In addition, under co-product accounting, copper was allocated a higher percentage of total costs during 2004, compared to 2003, as the average copper price increased (55%) more significantly than did the average gold price (13%) in 2004. In 2003, equity copper pounds and gold ounces sold decreased 5% and 18%, respectively, from 2002. The decrease in copper sales was primarily attributable to lower mill throughput. Gold equity ounces sold increased 22% due a 25% increase in the gold grade processed. Total equity cash costs on a co-product basis for copper and gold were similar in 2003 and 2002. Sales for 2005 are expected to total approximately 330 to 360 million equity pounds of copper at total cash costs per equity pound of $0.58 to $0.64 and 430,000 equity ounces of gold at total cash costs per equity ounce of $145. Minahasa . Gold equity ounces sold decreased 24% in 2004 from 2003, primarily reflecting lower grade ore and the completion of milling on August 30, 2004 resulting in lower mill throughput. Mining activities at Minahasa ceased late in 2001. The remaining stockpiles were processed by August 30, 2004. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold decreased 37% from 2002, primarily due to a 27% decrease in mill ore grade and a 3% decrease in mill throughput. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 14%, primarily due to the increased use of consumables, higher diesel fuel prices and a higher level of contracted services, partially offset by lower administrative expenses. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal actions related to Minahasa. Central Asia Operations Equity Ozs.

Gold equity ounces sold decreased 4% in 2004 from 2003 as a result of a 3% decrease in ore grade and a 2% decrease in ore placed on the leach pads. The lower ore grade is expected to continue during 2005. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 3% primarily a result of the decrease in gold ounces sold. In 2003, gold equity ounces sold decreased 15% from 2002 due to a 19% decrease in ore grade processed, partially offset by a 3% increase in ore placed on the leach pads. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 10%, primarily due to the decrease in gold equity ounces sold. Zarafshan-Newmont is expected to sell approximately 150,000 equity ounces in 2005 at total cash costs of $215 per equity ounce. Based on current mine plans, gold sales at Zarafshan-Newmont are expected to vary between 150,000 and 180,000 equity ounces per year during the four years after 2005. Ovacik, Turkey . Gold ounces sold decreased 35% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to a suspension of operations, discussed below, partially offset by reducing ore stockpiles and exhausting circuit inventory. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 50%, primarily due to the decline in production. In 2003, gold ounces sold increased 34% from 2002, primarily attributable to a 48% increase in mill throughput resulting from a revised 75 Table of Contents mine plan that incorporated an open pit extension and increased mill efficiencies, partially offset by a 6% decrease in mill ore grade. Total cash costs per equity ounce increased 6% in 2003 from 2002 as the positive impact of increased gold sales was offset by higher processing costs and higher administration costs. In August 2004, the Ovacik mine suspended operations as a result of a court decision ordering suspension of operating permits pending completion of certain additional permitting requirements and the submission of an updated environmental impact assessment. On March 1, 2005, the Ovacik mine was sold to a subsidiary of Koza Davetiye, a Turkish conglomerate. Consideration for the mine included $20 million paid at closing and various contingent payments that could total as much as $24.5 million if all conditions precedent are met. In the second quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a write-down of $16.3 million related to the long-lived assets at the Ovacik mine. Proven and probable reserves and the carrying value of long-lived assets at December 31, 2004 were approximately 100,000 equity ounces and $26.4 million, respectively. Other Operations Equity Ozs.

Merchant Banking Merchant Banking is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Merchant Banking, also referred to as Newmont Capital, manages a Royalty Portfolio, an Equity Portfolio, and a Downstream Gold Refining business, and engages in Value Realization activities (managing interests in oil and gas, iron ore, and coal properties as well as providing in-house investment banking and advisory services). Merchant Banking manages a Royalty Portfolio which includes interests that were acquired as a result of the Franco-Nevada acquisition, as well as royalties created by virtue of its land bank activities (through sale or farm-out). Royalty interests are generally in the form of a net smelter return ( NSR ) royalty that provides for the payment of a specified percentage of production, less certain specified transportation and refining costs. In some cases, Newmont owns a net profit interest ( NPI ) entitling Newmont to a specified percentage of the net profits, as defined in each case, from a particular mining operation. The majority of NSR royalty revenue and NPI revenue can be received in cash or in-kind at the option of Newmont. Merchant Banking royalty interests and investments generated $65.8 million, $56.3 million and $35.7 million of Royalty and dividend income in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase from period-to-period was primarily attributable to steady performance from the gold and platinum group metals royalties coupled with higher gold and oil and gas prices. The 2004 increase also included distributions received from Canadian Oil Sands Trust. As of December 31, 2004, Merchant Banking Equity Portfolio had a market value of approximately $0.5 billion compared to the 2003 value of approximately $147 million. In addition to a gain of approximately $123.1 76 Table of Contents million during 2004, Merchant Banking purchased marketable equity securities of Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources, Ltd. for approximately $199.6 million and $19.2 million, respectively. On January 31, 2003, Kinross Gold Corporation ( Kinross ), Echo Bay Mines Ltd. ( Echo Bay ) and TVX Gold Inc. ( TVX Gold ) were combined, and TVX Gold acquired Newmont 49.9% interest in the TVX Newmont Americas joint venture. Under the terms of the combination and acquisition and through the efforts of Merchant Banking, Newmont received a 13.8% interest in the restructured Kinross in exchange for its then 45.67% interest in Echo Bay and $180 million for its interest in TVX Newmont Americas. Newmont recognized a pre-tax gain of $84.3 million on the transaction in Gain on investments, net during the first quarter of 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, Newmont sold a portion of its Kinross shares for total cash proceeds of $224.6 million and recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $7.4 million. At June 30, 2004, Newmont recognized a $38.5 million impairment of its investment in Kinross for an other-than-temporary decline in value in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Merchant Banking sold its 9.74% equity holding in marketable securities of Lihir Gold during 2002 for approximately $84 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of approximately $47.3 million. Merchant Banking also manages the Company interests in downstream gold refining and distribution businesses (40% interest in AGR Matthey Joint Venture ( AGR ) and 50% interest in European Gold Refineries ( EGR )). Merchant Banking earned $2.6 million, $0.7 million and $1.3 million in Equity income of affiliates through its investments in AGR and EGR in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Merchant Banking Value Realization activities include managing the reserve delineation program on its 100% owned heavy oil leases in Alberta, Canada, and advancing its other interests in coal, iron ore and natural gas. Merchant Banking provides advisory services to Newmont to assist it in managing its portfolio of operating and property interests. In 2004, Merchant Banking assistance was provided in the sale of non-core properties including Bronzewing in Australia, Perama in Greece and Midwest Uranium in Canada. In addition, Merchant Banking participated in the restructuring of Australian Magnesium Corporation eliminating all remaining Newmont obligations (see Other Investing Activities below). In 2003, Merchant Banking advised Newmont on a variety of transactions including the process of extinguishing the majority of the bond and derivative liabilities of NYOL. These transactions gave rise to a Gain on extinguishment of NYOL liabilities, net of $220.5 million net of transaction costs, for the year ended December 31, 2003. Total cash payments to extinguish the NYOL bonds and the NYOL derivatives liabilities (including costs) were $202.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2003. Exploration Exploration, research and development expenditures were $192.4 million, $115.2 million, and $88.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of which approximately $112.2 million, $81.5 million and $71.3 million, respectively, related to exploration activities managed by the Exploration Segment. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately $53.9 million, $14.8 million, and $3.6 million, respectively, related to advanced projects (feasibility studies and exploration drilling at Martabe, Akyem, Minas Conga and Ahafo), and approximately $26.3 million, $18.9 million and $14.0 million, respectively, related to research, development and other activities not managed by Newmont Exploration Segment. Exploration expenditures in 2004 reflect higher funding of exploration and related activities by Newmont in response to higher prevailing gold prices. During 2004, Newmont replaced approximately 11.3 million gold ounces of depletion and divestitures with 12.4 million ounces of additions to proven and probable reserves, of which approximately 70% were attributable to Exploration. Exploration activities during 2004 primarily focused on the Minas Conga deposit in Peru and the Phoenix deposit in Nevada. Newmont added 4.5 million equity gold ounces at Minas Conga and 2.3 million equity gold ounces at Phoenix in 2004. Exploration also focused its activities on Newmont two projects in Ghana where reserves increased to 10.6 million equity gold ounces at 77 Table of Contents Ahafo and 5.4 million equity gold ounces at Akyem as of December 31, 2004, compared to 7.6 million equity gold ounces and 4.3 million equity gold ounces, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Exploration activities during 2003 primarily focused on the Antonio and Corimayo deposits at Yanacocha, various deposits at the Company Nevada and Australian operations and the Ahafo and Akyem projects in Ghana. Newmont anticipates it will spend between approximately $170 million and $200 million on exploration activities in 2005. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates In addition to its domestic operations in the United States, Newmont has operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Uzbekistan, Bolivia and other foreign locations. The Company foreign operations sell their gold, copper and zinc production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and total cash costs per ounce or pound to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on the Company revenue since gold, copper and zinc are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 42%, 45% and 46% of Newmont total cash costs were paid in local currencies in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company total cash costs are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations in the Company Consolidated Financial Statements. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. The following chart demonstrates the impacts on total cash costs and total cash costs per ounce or pound of variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at Newmont foreign operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004.

However, in the event that a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact the Company cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the Company believes that the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold, copper or zinc sales and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization calculated using the units-of-production method and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment , which revised SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and superseded APB Opinion 25 Accounting for 80 Table of Contents Stock Issued to Employees and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R requires measurement and recording to the financial statements the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award, recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for such award. Newmont will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R on July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective application. Accordingly, compensation expense will be recognized for all newly granted awards and awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after July 1, 2005. Compensation cost for the unvested portion of awards that are outstanding as of July 1, 2005 will be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period. The compensation cost for the unvested portion of awards will be based on the fair value at date of grant as calculated for our pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123. The effect on net income and earnings per share in the periods following adoption of SFAS No. 123R are expected to be consistent with our pro forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123, except that estimated forfeitures will be considered in the calculation of compensation expense under SFAS No. 123R. Additionally, the actual effect on net income and earnings per share will vary depending upon the number and fair value of options granted in 2005 compared to prior years. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs-an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material as current period costs. It also requires that allocations of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The Statement applies to inventory costs incurred in the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Newmont has not determined the impact, if any, on the Company financial position or results from operations. A committee of the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) discussed the accounting for deferred stripping costs but did not reach a consensus in 2004. The Task Force considered the recommendation that stripping costs incurred during production are a mine development cost that should be capitalized as an investment in the mine and attributed to the proven and probable reserves benefited in a systematic and rational manner. However, the Task Force directed the FASB staff to develop additional guidance about what constitutes a systematic and rational manner of attributing the capitalized costs to proven and probable reserves benefited. The Company cannot predict whether the deliberations of the EITF will ultimately modify or otherwise result in new accounting standards or interpretations thereof that differ from the Company current practices. Liquidity and Capital Resources For 2004, Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,556.8 million, compared to $684.4 million and $684.7 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was significantly impacted by the following key factors: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Equity gold ounces sold (in thousands) 6,988.4 7,383.6 7,631.7 Average price received per ounce of gold $ 412 $ 366 $ 313 Total cash costs per equity ounce of gold sold $ 231 $ 203 $ 189 Equity copper pounds sold (in millions) 422.3 417.7 407.0 Average price received per pound of copper $ 1.33 $ 0.86 $ 0.79 Exploration, research and development expenditures (in millions) $ 192.4 $ 115.2 $ 88.9 (Use) source of cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities (in millions) $ (89.3 ) $ (231.9 ) $ 13.3 Cash flow from operations during 2004 was impacted by the consolidation of Batu Hijau effective January 1, 2004, and higher gold and copper prices, partially offset by higher costs at virtually all operations and lower ounces sold in Nevada and Canada. Additionally, cash was used in 2004 to reduce operating accounts payable and reclamation liabilities by $64.0 million and $50.7 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease 81 Table of Contents in operating trade and accounts receivable of $50.1 million primarily related to copper concentrate sales. Cash used in 2003 for operating assets and liabilities primarily related to $118.8 million used for early settlement of effective derivative instruments and a temporary build up of inventories at 2003 year end that reduced cash flow from operations by $72.8 million. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities was $(1.4) billion, $(380.0) million and $112.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Newmont primary investing activities are Additions to property, plant and mine development, which were $718.0 million, $504.5 million and $300.1 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures during 2004 was primarily from development projects at Nevada and Ahafo as well as the consolidation of Batu Hijau. See Additions to Property, plant and mine development below for more information on capital expenditures. The Company also invested $1.7 billion in marketable debt and equity securities, primarily consisting of $1.5 billion for auction rate securities and $199.6 million for the Canadian Oil Sands Trust investment. Additionally, cash proceeds from the sale of investments impacted investing cash flow by $899.1 million, primarily consisting of $894.3 million for auction rate securities sold as part of the auction process. Also impacting cash flows from investing activities for 2004 was the recognition of $82.2 million of Batu Hijau cash balances in the Company balance sheet at January 1, 2004. In 2003 and 2002, the Company engaged in significant acquisition and disposition activity related to the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada and the subsequent disposition of investments acquired as part of those acquisitions. The year 2003 included $180.0 million in proceeds from the sale of TVX Newmont Americas and $232.2 million from the sale of Kinross Gold Corporation and other marketable securities; partially offset by $189.4 million investments in marketable debt and equity securities, primarily related to auction rate securities and investments in affiliates of $70.1 million. Additionally, during 2003, $57.6 million was used for the early settlement of ineffective derivative instruments and $11.2 million was used to acquire the Newmont NFM minority interests. Cash from investing activities in 2002 included $404.4 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, $84.0 million of proceeds from the sale of investments and $50.8 million of proceeds from the settlement of cross currency swaps, offset by $90.3 million of net cash consideration for the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada. See Investing Activities, below. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(475.2) million in 2004, compared to $400.7 million and $(558.9) million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily consisted of $253.7 million of debt repayments offset by proceeds from debt and stock issuances totaling $55.9 million and $77.5 million, respectively. The Company also used $236.9 million to pay dividends to minority interests during 2004 compared to $146.0 million and $28.8 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in dividends paid to minority interests was due to the consolidation of Batu Hijau, which had minority interest dividends of approximately $100.7 million during 2004. Additionally, $133.3 million was used to pay dividends to common stockholders during 2004, which increased to $0.30 per common share in 2004 from $0.17 per common share in 2003. The increase in cash from financing activities in 2003 was primarily related to approximately $1.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of 25 million shares of the Company common stock, proceeds of $492.8 million from borrowings under the Company credit facilities, $162.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock on the exercise of Franco-Nevada Class B warrants and $96.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to stock compensation plans, partially offset by $1.2 billion of debt repayments and $70.8 million of cash paid for dividends on common and preferred stock. Financing activities in 2002 included repayments of approximately $1.0 billion of debt partially offset by draw-downs on the Company credit facilities of $493.4 million. See Financing Activities, below. 82 Table of Contents Newmont contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (unaudited, in millions) Debt (1) $ 1,791.7 $ 398.7 $ 768.9 $ 243.4 $ 380.7 Capital lease obligations (1) 394.4 32.6 110.6 76.4 174.8 Remediation and reclamation obligations (2) 749.9 65.7 190.5 90.4 403.3 Other long-term liabilities (3) 122.2 17.9 40.2 21.7 42.4 Operating leases 24.4 4.2 11.2 5.7 3.3 Minimum royalty payments 27.5 10.2 6.9 10.4 Purchase obligations (4) 203.0 158.3 27.8 11.9 5.0 Other (5) 121.8 106.8 7.1 2.1 5.8 $ 3,434.9 $ 794.4 $ 1,163.2 $ 451.6 $ 1,025.7 (1) Amounts represent principal and estimated interest payments assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, the Company is required to close its operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these remediation and reclamation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding remediation and reclamation liabilities, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Contractual obligations for Other long-term liabilities include employee related liabilities such as severance, pension funding and other benefit plans. Pension plan funding beyond 2005 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (5) Other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the Company Consolidated Financial Statements include labor and service contracts. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases as disclosed in the above table and $357.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Newmont also provides an undrawn contingent support line of credit to Batu Hijau of $65 million. Batu Hijau has sales agreements to sell copper concentrates as follows (in thousands of metric tons): 930 in 2005; 685 in 2006; 650 in 2007; 625 in 2008 and 2009; and 2,725 thereafter. For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. Future Cash Flows The Company expects to use cash for capital expenditures (see Investing Activities, below), to fund the Exploration and Merchant Banking Segments (see Results of Operations, above) and to service debt. For information on the Company long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 11 to the 83 Table of Contents Consolidated Financial Statements. Newmont believes it will be able to fund all existing obligations from either Net cash provided by operating activities or cash and marketable debt securities on hand. Subject to any significant adverse changes in the Company long-term view of gold and copper prices, the Company has both the ability and intention to fund from Net cash provided by operating activities, the exploration expenditures and Merchant Banking investments that were assumed in the valuations performed to allocate goodwill to the Exploration and Merchant Banking Segments as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada (see Critical Accounting Policies, above). The Company believes it will be able to raise funds as needed in the future as opportunities for expansion arise. Newmont cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the spot price of gold and copper. The Company has a series of price-capped gold sales contracts under which it will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $350 per ounce in 2005 to $392 per ounce in 2011. The Company also has copper collar contracts for 580.9 million pounds of copper under which it will realize a minimum and maximum price of $1.10 and $1.30 per pound, respectively, in 2005 through 2007. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont Net cash provided by operating activities to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian dollar. For information concerning the sensitivity of the Company cash costs to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. The Company has entered into Australian dollar net zero-cost collar contracts under which it will purchase Australian dollars at a minimum average floor price of $0.568 and average maximum cap price of $0.783 per Australian dollar in 2005 and 2006. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont Net cash provided to operating activities to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Based on Newmont production profile for the next three years and proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2004, without considering future additions to such reserves, Newmont expects that equity ounces sold in 2005, 2006 and 2007 will be between 6.5 and 7.0 million equity ounces. The Company does not anticipate that reasonably expected variations in gold or copper sales alone will influence its ability to pay its debt and other obligations over that period. 84 Table of Contents Investing Activities Additions to Property, Plant and Mine Development Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) North America: Nevada, USA $ 168.7 $ 111.9 $ 54.6 Golden Giant, Canada 1.8 0.3 6.6 Holloway, Canada 5.2 2.8 1.2 La Herradura, Mexico 4.3 2.7 1.4 180.0 117.7 63.8 South America: Yanacocha, Peru 231.9 205.7 146.2 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 4.4 0.9 0.6 236.3 206.6 146.8 Australia/New Zealand: Pajingo, Australia 11.0 15.1 10.2 Yandal, Australia 19.5 17.4 20.7 Tanami, Australia 18.2 39.7 10.5 Kalgoorlie, Australia 27.2 14.9 8.6 Martha, New Zealand 6.6 12.3 5.3 Golden Grove, Australia 30.1 17.5 10.7 Other, Australia 6.9 2.3 2.8 119.5 119.2 68.8 Indonesia: Batu Hijau 34.6 N/A N/A Central Asia: Zarafshan, Uzbekistan 9.3 7.7 3.9 Ovacik, Turkey 8.5 6.5 4.0 17.8 14.2 7.9 Africa: Akyem, Ghana 8.9 7.8 Ahafo, Ghana 83.4 12.9 92.3 20.7 Corporate and Other 37.5 26.1 12.8 $ 718.0 $ 504.5 $ 300.1 Capital expenditures for North American operations during 2004 primarily included $51.6 million for the development of the Leeville underground mine, $26.2 million for the development of the Phoenix Project and $20.9 million for the Mill 5 flotation plant expansion.

Corporate Revolving Credit Facilities Through July 29, 2004, the Company had three uncollateralized revolving credit facilities with a consortium of banks: a $200 million U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility with an initial term of 364 days that was permitted to be extended annually to no later than October 2006; a $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that matured in October 2006 and provided for borrowing in U.S., Canadian and Australian dollars, and which also contained a letter of credit sub-facility; and a $150 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that was to mature in May 2005 and provided for borrowing in U.S. and Australian dollars. Interest rates and facility fees varied based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bore interest at a rate per annum equal to either the LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.45% to 1.25% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the lead bank prime rate plus a margin ranging from 0% to 0.25%. Facility fees were accrued at a rate per annum ranging from 0.10% to 0.40% of the commitment. Effective July 30, 2004, the Company entered into a new uncollateralized $1.25 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks. This new revolving credit facility replaced the three existing revolving credit facilities which were cancelled upon the effectiveness of the new facility. The new facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contains a letter of credit sub-facility. The new facility matures July 30, 2009. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, 88 Table of Contents uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.285% to 1.150% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the lead bank prime rate plus, in each case, a margin ranging from 0% to 0.150%. Facility fees accrue at a rate per annum ranging from 0.090% to 0.350% of the aggregate commitments. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 0.125% on the amount of revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. Letters of credit issued under the prior credit facilities letter of credit sub-facility were transferred to and remain outstanding under the new facility letter of credit sub-facility. At December 31, 2004, the facility fees were 0.125% of the commitment. There was $357.2 million outstanding under the letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2004. Prepaid Forward Sales Contract In July 1999, the Company entered into a prepaid forward gold sales contract (the Prepaid Forward ) and a forward gold purchase contract (the Forward Purchase ). Under the Prepaid Forward, the Company agreed to sell 483,333 ounces of gold, to be delivered in June of each of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in annual installments of 161,111 ounces (the Annual Delivery Requirements ). The Company also agreed under the Prepaid Forward to deliver semi-annually 17,951 ounces of gold, from June 2000 through June 2007 (the Semi-Annual Delivery Requirements ) for a total gold delivery obligation over the life of the Prepaid Forward of 752,598 ounces. At the time the Prepaid Forward was entered into, the Company received net proceeds of $137.2 million ($145.0 million of gross proceeds before transaction costs of $653,000 and the purchase of a $7.1 million surety bond to guarantee delivery of the Annual Delivery Requirements). The Company may also be entitled to receive additional proceeds in the future in connection with the annual deliveries of 161,111 ounces, to be determined at each delivery date based on the excess, if any, of the then market price for gold (up to a maximum of $380 per ounce) over $300 per ounce. At the time the Company entered into the Prepaid Forward, it also entered into the Forward Purchase, with the same counterparty, to hedge the price risk with respect to the Semi-Annual Delivery Requirements. The Forward Purchase provides for semi-annual purchases of 17,951 ounces of gold on each semi-annual delivery date under the Prepaid Forward at prices increasing from $263 per ounce in 2000 to $354 per ounce in 2007. On each semi-annual delivery date, the ounces purchased under the Forward Purchase are delivered in satisfaction of the Company delivery requirements under the Prepaid Forward. The transaction has been accounted for as a single borrowing of $145 million, with interest accruing, based on an effective interest rate recognized over the full term of the borrowing. Scheduled repayments are $48.3 million in each of years 2005, 2006 and 2007. Using relevant future market conditions and financial models, the estimated negative fair value of these contracts was approximately $204.5 million and $208.7 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Debt Covenants Certain of Newmont current debt facilities contain various common public debt covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. These debt instruments include the medium-term notes, 8 5 / 8 % debentures, 8 3 / 8 % debentures and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant. None of the aforementioned public debt instruments contain financial ratio covenants or credit rating provisions that could create liquidity issues for the Company. In addition to the covenants noted above, the Company new revolving credit facility contains financial ratio covenants requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash) to EBITDA (Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total capitalization ratio (ratio of net debt to total capitalization, which includes owner equity retained earnings and fixed assets) of less than or equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company assets and a negative pledge on certain assets. 89 Table of Contents Certain of the Company project debt facilities contain various common project debt covenants and default provisions including limitations on dividends subject to certain debt service cover ratios, limitations on sales of assets, negative pledges on certain assets, change of control provisions and limitations of additional permitted debt. At December 31, 2004, the Company and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants and default provisions in all material respects.

Newmont expects to be able to fund maturities of its debt from Net cash provided by operating activities and existing cash balances . Shelf Registration Statement In January 2004, Newmont filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables it to issue debt and equity securities from time-to-time having an aggregate offering price up to $1.0 billion. Newmont also filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 which enables it to issue, from time-to-time in connection with future acquisitions of businesses, properties or assets, common stock and common stock warrants having an aggregate offering price of $200 million. These registration statements were declared effective on February 4, 2004. Common Stock Offering During November 2003, Newmont completed an equity offering for 25 million shares of its common stock under its existing shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion from this offering are being used for general corporate purposes. Dividends The Company paid dividends of $0.30 per common share during 2004, $0.17 per common share during 2003 and $0.12 per common share in 2002. On February 2, 2005, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, payable March 24, 2005 to holders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2005. Redemption of Convertible Preferred Convertible Stock In April 2002, Newmont announced the redemption of all issued and outstanding shares of its $3.25 cumulative convertible preferred stock as of May 15, 2002. Pursuant to the terms of the cumulative convertible preferred stock, Newmont paid a redemption price of $50.325 per share, plus $0.8125 per share for accrued dividends at the redemption date. In settlement of the total redemption price of $51.1375 per preferred share, Newmont issued each holder of record 1.19187 shares of its common stock and cash for any remaining fractional interests. The Company paid $3.7 million in preferred stock dividends in 2002. Environmental The Company mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future 90 Table of Contents reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, $410.3 million and $361.0 million, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties. The increase in 2004 is primarily attributable to the consolidation of Batu Hijau (see Accounting Changes above). In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Company best estimate of its liability for these matters, $74.9 million and $58.6 million were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 81% greater or 34% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2004. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Other expenses in the period estimates are revised. Newmont spent $19.6 million, $18.7 million, and $14.6 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and expects to spend between $18 million and $20 million in 2005. Expenditures for 2004 related primarily to legacy Normandy properties in Australia, the McCoy/Cove property in central Nevada and the Dawn mill site near Ford, Washington. Expenditures for 2003 related primarily to the Dawn mill site and the McCoy/Cove property. Expenditures for 2002 relate primarily to the Dawn mill site and the Resurrection site near Leadville, Colorado. Included in capital expenditures were $43.1 million, $25.7 million and $14.3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Expenditures of between $30 million and $35 million are anticipated in 2005. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of cash operating costs.
