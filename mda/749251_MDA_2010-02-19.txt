ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The purpose of the following Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is to help facilitate the understanding of significant factors influencing the operating results, financial condition and cash flows of Gartner, Inc. Additionally, the MD&A also conveys our expectations of the potential impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that may impact future results. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for future periods. References to the Company, we, our, and us are to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following items impact the presentation and discussion of results in this MD&A section: On December 18, 2009 we acquired AMR Research, and on December 30, 2009 we acquired Burton Group. The financial results of these businesses, which were not material to our 2009 results, have been included in our results beginning on their respective dates of acquisition (see Note 2 Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The operating metrics of these acquired businesses have been excluded from our Business Measurements presentations and discussions below for comparability purposes. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company reclassified certain amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company eliminated its previously reported Other revenue line. The Other revenue line primarily consisted of fees earned from Research reprints and other miscellaneous products, and these revenues and related expenses are now included in the Research segment. In addition, certain expenses that were formerly classified in Selling, general & administrative are now included in Cost of services and product development and are included in Research segment expense. Prior periods have been reclassified in order to be consistent with the current period presentation. (see Note 1 Business Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In early 2008 we sold our Vision Events business, which had been part of our Events segment. As a result, the results of operations for this business for 2008 and earlier periods have been reported as a discontinued operation (see Note 3 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

BUSINESS OVERVIEW Gartner, Inc. is the world leading information technology research and advisory company that helps executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We offer independent and objective research and analysis on the information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology industries. We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to approximately 10,000 client organizations, including approximately 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, in over 80 countries. Our client base consists primarily of CIOs and other senior IT and executives from a wide variety of business enterprises, government agencies and the investment community. We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research provides insight for CIOs, other IT executives and professionals, business leaders, technology companies and the investment community through research reports and briefings, access to our analysts, as well as peer networking services and membership programs. Consulting consists primarily of consulting engagements that utilize our research insight, benchmarking data, problem-solving methodologies and hands on experience to improve the return on an organization IT investment through assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality. 12 Table of Contents Events consists of various symposia, summits and conferences focused on the IT industry as a whole, as well as IT applicable to particular industries and particular roles within an organization. BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Number of executive program members represents the number of paid participants in executive programs. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing Rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the number of people who attend events. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION We purchased AMR Research and Burton Group in December 2009. We believe each of these companies is recognized as best-in-class for what they do, and will expand our research market opportunity and accelerate our growth rate over time. We had total revenues of $1,139.8 million in 2009, a decline of 11% from the prior year. Revenues decreased in all 3 of our business segments and all of our geographic regions. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenues were down about 8% in 2009. We attribute the decline in revenue to the global economic downturn that began in 2008. We had income from continuing operations of $83.0 million in 2009, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $97.1 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, for 2008. The decline primarily reflects lower profitability in our Consulting and Events segments. Research revenues were down 4% year-over-year, to $752.5 million in 2009 from $781.6 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Research revenues were down 1% year-over-year. Despite the year-over-year decline in Research revenues, gross contribution margin increased by 2 points, primarily due to the tight cost controls we have implemented and to a lesser extent, our ability to implement price increases for our products. As of December 31, 2009, research contract value was $784.4 million, client retention was 78%, and wallet retention was 87%. Research contract value at December 31, 2009 was down 6% compared to the prior year end, but adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, was down 1% year-over-year. While down year-over-year, the $784.4 million of contract value at December 31, 2009 increased 6% from September 30, 2009, reflecting a broad-based increase with all industries, geographies, and client sizes showing improvement during the quarter. Consulting revenues declined 17% year-over-year, to $286.8 million in 2009 from $347.4 million in 2008, primarily due to a decline in core consulting. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues declined 15%. The Consulting segment contribution margin declined 2 points, primarily due to lower revenue in our contract optimization business and fewer SAS days filled, which have a higher contribution margin than core consulting. Utilization in core consulting was 68% for 2009. Backlog was $90.9 million at December 31, 2009, a decline of 6% from December 31, 2008. Events revenues decreased 33% in 2009 compared to the prior year due to discontinued events and a decline in revenue from our on-going events. We discontinued a number of events in 2009 in response to the economic downturn, travel restrictions, and other 13 Table of Contents factors. We held 54 events in 2009 compared to 70 in 2008, with a 12% decline in attendees at our 51 on-going events. The segment contribution margin declined by 2 points year-over-year, to 41%. For a more detailed discussion of our segment results, see Segment Results below. During 2009 we continued our focus on enhancing shareholder value by reducing our outstanding debt. We repaid $95.3 million of our term loans during 2009, which represented approximately 32% of the amount outstanding. We also used $104.5 million in cash to acquire AMR Research and Burton Group. We had $161.9 million of operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $116.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and we had approximately $170.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We believe that our cash position and borrowing capacity is more than adequate to meet our existing cash and liquidity requirements. FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our SymposiumITxpo series, that normally are held during the fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services; competition in the industry; and other factors. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below. The preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. On-going changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company financial statements in future periods. Our critical accounting policies are as follows: Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met, revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is shipped. Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment. Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition. The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses, which have not produced material cancellations to date. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. For those government contracts that permit cancellation, we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract. In addition, we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received. Deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were $65.3 million and $61.6 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had 14 Table of Contents not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit termination of $8.3 million and $12.1 million, respectively. Uncollectible fees receivable The allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2009 2008 Total fees receivable $ 325,698 $ 326,311 Allowance for losses (8,100 ) (7,800 ) Fees receivable, net $ 317,598 $ 318,511 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. Our annual goodwill assessment requires us to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge for a portion of the associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in our financial statements. Factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant negative industry or economic trends; Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and Our market capitalization relative to net book value. Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. We completed the annual goodwill impairment testing in the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and concluded that the fair values of each of the Company reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values. Accounting for income taxes As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made. Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ) and No. 110 ( SAB No. 110 ). The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, 15 Table of Contents over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (see Note 10 Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the Company Common Stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. Restructuring and other accruals We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. We also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operation for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Ended Ended Dollar Percentage Ended Ended Dollar Percentage December 31, December 31, Increase Increase December 31, December 31, Increase Increase 2009 (a) 2008 (Decrease) (Decrease) 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Decrease) Total revenues $ 1,139,800 $ 1,279,065 $ (139,265 ) (11 )% $ 1,279,065 $ 1,168,475 $ 110,590 9 % Costs and expenses: Cost of services and product development 498,363 572,208 73,845 13 % 572,208 546,569 (25,639 ) (5 )% Selling, general and administrative 477,003 514,994 37,991 7 % 514,994 456,975 (58,019 ) (13 )% Depreciation 25,387 25,880 493 2 % 25,880 24,298 (1,582 ) (7 )% Amortization of intangibles 1,636 1,615 (21 ) (1 )% 1,615 2,091 476 (23 )% Acquisition and integration charges 2,934 (2,934 ) (100 )% Other charges 9,084 9,084 100 % Operating income 134,477 164,368 (29,891 ) (18 )% 164,368 129,458 34,910 27 % Interest expense, net (16,032 ) (19,269 ) 3,237 17 % (19,269 ) (22,154 ) 2,885 13 % Other (expense) income, net (2,919 ) (358 ) (2,561 ) >(100 )% (358 ) 3,193 (3,551 ) >(100 )% Provision for income taxes 32,562 47,593 15,031 32 % 47,593 39,831 (7,762 ) (19 )% Income from continuing operations 82,964 97,148 (14,184 ) (15 )% 97,148 70,666 26,482 37 % Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 6,723 (6,723 ) (100 )% 6,723 2,887 3,836 >100 % Net income $ 82,964 $ 103,871 $ (20,907 ) (20 )% $ 103,871 $ 73,553 $ 30,318 41 % (a) In December 2009 we acquired AMR Research and Burton Group. The operating results of these businesses are included in our consolidated results beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. The results of these businesses were not material to our 2009 results. 2009 VERSUS 2008 TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 decreased $139.3 million, or 11%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. Revenues declined across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business 16 Table of Contents segments. The impact of foreign currency had a negative impact on our revenues in 2009, and excluding this impact, total revenues in 2009 were down 8% compared to 2008. Our revenues and operating results were negatively impacted by global economic conditions in 2009. An overview of our results by geographic region follows: Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients decreased 8%, to $663.8 million in 2009 from $723.2 million in 2008. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) decreased to $360.8 million in 2009 from $430.4 million in 2008, a 16% decrease. Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region decreased 8%, to $115.2 million in 2009 from $125.4 million in 2008. An overview of our results by segment follows: Research revenues decreased 4% in 2009 to $752.5 million compared to $781.6 million in 2008, and comprised approximately 66% and 61% of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Consulting revenues decreased 17% in 2009 to $286.8 million, compared to $347.4 million in 2008, and comprised approximately 25% and 27% of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Events revenues were $100.4 million in 2009, a decrease of 33% from $150.1 million in 2008, and comprised approximately 9% and 12% of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT decreased $73.8 million year-over-year, or 13%. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation reduced expense by about $19.0 million. We had lower conference expenses of $18.5 million primarily due to discontinued events. We also had reduced travel and internal meeting charges of $16.7 million and lower personnel costs of about $12.5 million, primarily due to our tight cost controls. The remaining $7.1 million net decrease was spread across a number of other expense categories. Cost of services and product development as a percentage of sales declined by 1 point, to 44% in 2009 from 45% in 2008, primarily due to tight expense controls across our businesses. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense decreased by about $38.0 million in 2009, or 7%, compared to 2008, despite increasing our sales force. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced expense by about $18.0 million. We also had lower travel, internal meeting, and recruiting costs of about $19.0 million, again due to our tight cost controls. The remaining net reduction was spread across a number of other expense categories. Excluding the 60 sales associates that joined us from AMR Research and Burton Group, we had 942 quota-bearing sales associates at December 31, 2009, a 2% increase from the prior year end. This additional investment in sales associates resulted in $9.0 million of higher payroll and benefits costs, which was offset by lower G&A charges. DEPRECIATION expense decreased 2% year-over-year which reflects reduced capital spending during 2009. Capital spending decreased to $15.1 million in 2009 from $24.3 million in 2008, a 38% decline, which reflects the Company reduced 2009 capital expenditures. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $1.6 million for both 2009 and 2008. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $2.9 million in 2009 and zero in 2008. Included is these charges are legal fees and consultant fees in connection with the acquisitions and integration of AMR Research and Burton Group, as well as severance costs related to redundant headcount. OPERATING INCOME decreased 18% year-over-year, to $134.5 million in 2009 from $164.4 million in 2008. Operating income as a percentage of revenues declined 1 point year-over-year, primarily due to lower profitability in our Consulting and Events segments and the $2.9 million acquisition and integration charge related to AMR Research and Burton Group. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled Segment Results below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $16.0 million in 2009 and $19.3 million in 2008, a 17% decline. The 2009 period includes $1.1 million of expense related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting on an interest rate swap contract (See Note 7 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the $1.1 million charge, Interest expense, net would have 17 Table of Contents declined approximately 22% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in the weighted-average amount of debt outstanding. OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET of $(2.9) million in 2009 consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses. The $(0.4) million Other expense in 2008 primarily consisted of a $1.2 million gain related to the settlement of a litigation matter offset by net foreign currency exchange losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES on continuing operations was $32.6 million in 2009 as compared to $47.6 million in 2008. The effective tax rate was 28.2% in 2009 and 32.9% in 2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 is attributable to several items. The most significant of these items include the following: (a) the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions relating to the expiration of statutes of limitation was larger in 2009 than in 2008 while pretax income was lower, and (b) differences relating to the taxability of life insurance contracts year-over-year. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, includes the results of the Company Vision Events business, which we sold in early 2008. The $6.7 million of income for 2008 includes a net gain on sale of approximately $7.1 million and a $(0.4) million operating loss. NET INCOME was $83.0 million in 2009 and $103.9 million in 2008, a decline of $20.9 million or 20%. The decline was primarily driven by the reduced contributions by our three business segments in the 2009 period and to a lesser extent, the $2.9 million acquisition and integration charge we recorded related to AMR Research and Burton Group. These decreases were partially offset by lower SG&A charges, a lower effective income tax rate, and reduced interest expense. Also contributing to the year-over-year decline in net income was the $6.7 million net gain from the sale of the Company former Vision Events business recorded in the 2008 period. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 14% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 13% year-over-year. 2008 VERSUS 2007 TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 increased $110.6 million, or 9%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in our Research and Consulting segments. Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, total revenues for 2008 would have increased 8% over 2007. An overview of our results by geographic region follows: Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 9%, to $723.2 million in 2008 from $661.2 million in 2007. Revenues from sales to clients in EMEA increased to $430.4 million in 2008 from $403.9 million in 2007, a 7% increase. Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region increased 21%, to $125.4 million in 2008 from $103.3 million in 2007. An overview of our results by segment follows: Research revenues increased 14% in 2008 to $781.6 million, compared to $683.4 million in 2007, and comprised approximately 61% and 58% of our total revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Consulting revenues increased 7% in 2008 to $347.4 million, compared to $325.0 million in 2007, and comprised approximately 27% and 28% of our total revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Events revenues were $150.1 million in 2008, a decrease of 6% from $160.1 million in 2007, and comprised approximately 12% and 14% of our total revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT increased $25.6 million year-over-year, or 5%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, Cost of service and product development would have increased by about 4%. The year-over-year increase was due to several factors. We had $17.0 million of higher salary, commissions, and other benefit costs, $5.7 million in additional severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force, and $4.0 million in additional Events fulfillment costs. The impact of foreign currency translation added about $2.1 million of expense. Partially offsetting these higher charges was a decrease of approximately $3.2 million in lower headcount costs, primarily due to our exit from consulting operations in Asia-Pacific in mid-2007. 18 Table of Contents As a percentage of sales, Cost of services and product development was 45% and 47% in 2008 and 2007 respectively, a decrease of 2 points, which is due to a number of factors. These factors include higher revenues coupled with the inherent operating leverage in our Research business, improved productivity in core Consulting, substantially increased revenues in our higher margin contract optimization business in our Consulting segment, and a continued focus on expense management. SG&A expense increased by $58.0 million in 2008, or 13%, compared to 2007. The increase in 2008 expense was primarily due to higher investment in our sales organization, severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force, and increases in other payroll and benefits costs. Growth in our sales organization resulted in approximately $38.0 million of additional payroll and benefits, commissions, and travel expense in 2008 when compared to 2007. We had 928 quota-bearing sales associates as of December 31, 2008, a 15% increase over December 31, 2007. We had $2.8 million in severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter 2008 reduction in force, while higher payroll and related benefits costs for our other staff added about $13.0 million in costs. The remaining increase was spread across a number of other cost categories, which was offset to some extent by lower recruiting and stock-based compensation charges. DEPRECIATION expense increased 7% in 2008, to $25.9 million compared to $24.3 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a change in the mix of investment in capital expenditures. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $1.6 million in 2008 compared to $2.1 million in 2007. The decrease was due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2007. OTHER CHARGES was zero in 2008 and $9.1 million in 2007. The $9.1 million included charges of $8.7 million related to the settlement of litigation and $2.7 million of severance costs related to the Company exit from consulting operations in Asia. Offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.3 million related to an excess facility which the Company returned to service. OPERATING INCOME was $164.4 million and $129.5 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $34.9 million, or 27%. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13% in 2008 and 11% in 2007, a 2 point increase, which is due to a number of factors, the most significant being the impact from higher revenues in our Research and Consulting businesses. The improved operating margin also reflects our tight focus on expense management, and charges of $9.1 million in 2007 related to the settlement of litigation and other items. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled Segment Results below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $19.3 million and $22.2 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, a decrease of $2.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in the weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding debt. The weighted-average interest rate on our debt, including the impact of our interest rate swaps, was 4.8% in 2008 and 6.0% in 2007. The impact of the lower average rate was partially offset by an increase in the weighted-average amount of debt outstanding of approximately $50.0 million during 2008. In 2008 we also had about $0.2 million of additional interest income, as well as a $0.2 million decrease in the amortization of debt issuance costs, both of which are recorded in Interest Expense, net. OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET was $(0.4) million in 2008 and $3.2 million in 2007. The $(0.4) million Other expense in 2008 primarily consisted of a $1.2 million gain related to the settlement of a litigation matter offset by net foreign currency exchange losses. The $3.2 million of Other income in 2007 primarily consisted of a $1.8 million gain from the settlement of a claim and net foreign currency exchange gains. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES on continuing operations was $47.6 million in 2008 as compared to $39.8 million 2007. The effective tax rate was 32.9% in 2008 and 36.0% in 2007. The lower effective tax rate in 2008 as compared to 2007 was attributable to several items. The most significant of these items included the following: (a) the Company generated a larger percentage of its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2008 as compared to 2007, and (b) differences relating to the tax impact of repatriated funds in 2008 as compared to 2007. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, which includes the results of the Company Vision Events business, was $6.7 million and $2.9 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company sold the Vision Events business, which had been part of the Company Events segment, in early 2008. The results for 2008 included a net gain on the sale of approximately $7.1 million and a loss from operations of $(0.4) million. NET INCOME was $103.9 million and $73.6 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $30.3 million, or 41%. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.34 per share year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.33 per share year-over-year. 19 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, and SG&A, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, Amortization of intangibles, and Other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. We acquired AMR Research on December 18, 2009 and Burton Group on December 30, 2009. The financial results of these businesses are included in the Financial Measurements beginning on their respective dates of acquisition. The results of these businesses were not material to our segment results. Business Measurements exclude data applicable to these businesses.

(3) Excludes AMR Research and Burton Group. 2009 VERSUS 2008 Research revenues declined 4% year-over-year, but excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, Research revenues were down about 1%. In spite of lower revenues, the Research contribution margin increased 2 points year-over-year. The improved margin was primarily driven by the tight cost controls we have implemented, which resulted in lower costs concentrated in personnel, travel, and internal meetings, and our ability to implement price increases for our products. Contract value decreased 6% when comparing December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2008, but excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, contract value was down 1% year-over-year. While down year-over-year, contract value increased $42.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, or 6%, one of our highest ever quarterly increases, with growth across all industries, geographies, and client sizes. We believe the increase reflects both improved sales effectiveness as well as an improving economic environment. 2008 VERSUS 2007 Revenue in our Research business was up 14% in 2008, to $781.6 million. We had growth across our entire product portfolio in 2008. Foreign currency translation impact was not significant. Research gross contribution increased to $495.4 million in 2008 from $419.6 million in 2007, an 18% increase, while the contribution margin increased 2 points, to 63% from 61%. The year-over-year contribution margin improved primarily due to our stronger revenue performance coupled with the operating leverage inherent in our Research business, along with tight expense management. Contract value was $834.3 million as of December 31, 2008, up 11% from $752.5 million at December 31, 2007. Adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, contract value was up approximately 8%. 20 Table of Contents Consulting 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 As Of And As Of And As Of And As Of And For the For the For the For the Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Ended Ended Percentage Ended Ended Percentage December 31, December 31, Increase Increase December 31, December 31, Increase Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) (Decrease) 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Decrease) Financial Measurements: (1) Revenues (2) $ 286,847 $ 347,404 $ (60,557) (17 )% $ 347,404 $ 325,030 $ 22,374 7 % Gross contribution (2) $ 112,099 $ 141,395 $ (29,296) (21 )% $ 141,395 $ 128,215 $ 13,180 10 % Gross contribution margin 39 % 41 % (2) points 41 % 39 % 2 points Business Measurements: (3) Backlog (2) $ 90,891 $ 97,169 $ (6,278) (6 % $ 97,169 $ 121,400 $ (24,231 ) (20 )% Billable headcount 442 499 (57) (11 % 499 472 27 6 % Consultant utilization 68 % 72 % (4) points 72 % 69 % 3 points Average annualized revenue per billable headcount (2) $ 435 $ 460 $ (25) (5 )% $ 460 $ 430 $ 30 7 % (1) Includes the operating results of AMR Research and Burton Group, which we purchased in December 2009.

(3) Excludes AMR Research and Burton Group. 2009 VERSUS 2008 Consulting revenues declined 17% when comparing 2009 with 2008, with the majority of the decline in core consulting, and to a lesser extent, in our SAS and contract optimization businesses. The decline in core consulting was driven by lower headcount, utilization, and billing rates. The decline in revenue in our contract optimization business reflects a large contract received at the end of 2008 which was not repeated in 2009. SAS revenues declined due to approximately 17% fewer fulfilled SAS days. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, overall Consulting revenues were down about 15%. The 2 point decline in the Consulting contribution margin reflects lower revenue in our SAS and contract optimization businesses, which have higher margins than core consulting. To a lesser extent, the decline also reflects lower utilization and billing rates in core consulting. We ended 2009 with 442 billable consultants, a decline of 11% from the prior year end as we tightly managed resources to match demand. The decline reflects normal attrition as well as the termination of approximately 30 consultants in January 2009 to better align our delivery resources with lower backlog. Consulting backlog declined 6% year-over-year but increased 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $90.9 million, as demand for our consulting services was solid in the U.S. while demand in Europe lagged. 2008 VERSUS 2007 Consulting revenues increased year-over-year by $22.4 million, or 7%. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues for 2008 were up about 6%. The revenue increase was due to strength in both the core consulting and benchmarking businesses and exceptionally strong results in our contract optimization business. Contributing to the year-over-year revenue increase in our contract optimization business was the completion of one large contract in the fourth quarter of 2008 which resulted in approximately $11.0 million of revenue. Consulting gross contribution increased by $13.1 million while the gross contribution margin improved by 2 points. These improvements were driven by improved utilization on higher headcount and higher billing rates, and higher revenues in our contract optimization business, which has a higher margin than our core consulting business. Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, was $97.2 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $121.4 million at December 31, 2007, as bookings slowed in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the weaker economic environment. 21 Table of Contents Events 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 As Of And As Of And As Of And As Of And For the For the For the For the Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Ended Ended Percentage Ended Ended Percentage December 31, December 31, Increase Increase December 31, December 31, Increase Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) (Decrease) 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Decrease) Financial Measurements: (1) Revenues(2) $ 100,448 $ 150,080 $ (49,632) (33 )% $ 150,080 $ 160,065 $ (9,985 ) (6 )% Gross contribution(2) $ 40,945 $ 64,954 $ (24,009) (37 )% $ 64,954 $ 81,908 $ (16,954 ) (21 )% Gross contribution margin 41 % 43 % (2) points 43 % 51 % (8 ) points Business Measurements: (3) Number of events 54 70 (16) (23 )% 70 62 (8 ) (13 )% Number of attendees 30,610 41,352 (10,742) (26 )% 41,352 44,216 (2,864 ) (6 )% (1) Includes the operating results of AMR Research and Burton Group, which we purchased in December 2009.

(3) Excludes AMR Research and Burton Group. 2009 VERSUS 2008 Events revenue was down $49.6 million, or 33% in 2009 due to the impact of discontinued events and a decline in revenue from our on-going events. We held 54 events in 2009, a decline of 16 events compared to the prior year. The 54 events held in 2009 consisted of 51 on-going events and 3 new events. The number of attendees at our 51 on-going events was down 12% while the number of exhibitors was down 31%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, Events revenues were down 32% year-over-year. Approximately $24.0 million of the revenue decrease was due to 19 discontinued events, including our Spring Symposium, which was a significant event in prior years. We discontinued these events in 2009 in response to the difficult operating environment, with tight travel restrictions and budget cuts at many companies due to the weak economy. We also had a $30.0 million decline in revenue from our 51 on-going events. These declines were slightly offset by approximately $4.0 million in higher revenue from new event launches and other miscellaneous events revenues. The Events contribution margin was down 2 points year-over-year primarily due to lower average attendee and exhibitor revenue at our 51 on-going events. While the number of attendees was down significantly year-over-year, this trend began to show improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 with attendance at our on-going events up 2%. We also began to see improvement in exhibitor participation. We believe these trends reflect a loosening of corporate travel budgets, resumed growth in marketing spend by technology companies, and our continuing efforts to increase client retention by enhancing the value and experience that our clients derive from our events. 2008 VERSUS 2007 Events revenues decreased 6% year-over-year, or $10.0 million, reflecting lower revenues from both attendees and exhibitors. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, events revenues were down approximately 7% year-over-year. We held 70 events in 2008 compared to 62 events in 2007, with overall attendance down about 6%, to 41,352 in 2008 from 44,216 in 2007. The 70 events held in 2008 included 59 on-going events and 11 new events. During 2008, the number of exhibitors at our on-going events declined by approximately 13%, while attendance was 38,961 as compared to 42,554 attendees in 2007, an 8% decrease. Average revenue at these on-going events declined slightly for attendees but increased slightly for exhibitors. Revenues from the 11 new events we held in 2008 was only slightly higher than the events we discontinued. The majority of the year-over-year revenue shortfall occurred in our fourth quarter, as travel restrictions, cuts in marketing budgets, and other expense controls at many companies took effect in response to the credit crisis and weakening global economy. Events gross contribution was $65.0 million in 2008 compared to $81.9 million for 2007, while the year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 8 points, to 43% from 51%. The decrease in the gross contribution margin was primarily due to lower revenues, higher fulfillment costs, the impact of lower margin new events, and severance charges related to our reduction in force. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our on-going operating activities. As of December 31, 2009, we had $116.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $170.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility (not including the $100.0 million expansion feature). Our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with approximately 60% held outside the United States as of December 31, 2009. 22 Table of Contents We repaid $95.3 million of our term loans in 2009, thus reducing the amount of term loans outstanding by about 32%. We paid $104.5 million in cash in December 2009 and $13.1 million in January 2010 for the acquisitions of AMR Research and Burton Group. We believe that we have adequate liquidity and that the cash we expect to earn from our on-going operating activities, our existing cash balances, and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected short-term and foreseeable long-term operating needs. The following table summarizes the Company changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending December 31, 2009: 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Twelve Months Ended Ended Dollar Ended Ended Dollar December 31, December 31, Increase December 31, December 31, Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) 2008 2007 (Decrease) Cash provided by operating activities $ 161,937 $ 184,350 $ (22,413 ) $ 184,350 $ 148,335 $ 36,015 Cash used by investing activities (119,665 ) (16,455 ) (103,210 ) (16,455 ) (24,136 ) 7,681 Cash used in financing activities (73,780 ) (119,835 ) 46,055 (119,835 ) (93,695 ) (26,140 ) Net (decrease) increase (31,508 ) 48,060 (79,568 ) 48,060 30,504 17,556 Effects of exchange rates 7,153 (17,076 ) 24,229 (17,076 ) 11,640 (28,716 ) Beginning cash and cash equivalents 140,929 109,945 30,984 109,945 67,801 42,144 Ending cash and cash equivalents $ 116,574 $ 140,929 $ (24,355 ) $ 140,929 $ 109,945 $ 30,984 2009 VERSUS 2008 Operating Our operating cash flow decreased by 12% in 2009, or $22.4 million. We had a decline of approximately $23.0 million in cash from our core operations, along with $14.5 million more in cash taxes paid and $8.0 million in higher severance payments due to the workforce reduction completed in early January 2009. Partially offsetting the declines were $14.8 million in lower interest payments on our debt, bonus payments, and payments on our excess facilities, and an $8.3 million improvement in working capital. The improved working capital primarily reflects improved cash collection on receivables. Investing We used an additional $103.2 million of cash in our investing activities in 2009 due to the $104.5 million of cash used for the acquisitions of AMR Research and Burton Group. We had $15.1 million of capital expenditures in 2009, a decline of 38% compared to the $24.3 million of capital expenditures in 2008. The decline reflects the Company tight focus on reducing costs. We also realized $7.8 million of cash proceeds in 2008 from the sale of our Vision Events business. Financing Cash used in financing activities declined by $46.1 million, primarily due to a significant decline in the use of cash for stock repurchases. Cash used for stock repurchases declined by about $197.1 million. Offsetting the decline in cash used for share repurchases was an increase in the use of cash to repay debt of about $108.7 million and a decline in cash proceeds from option exercises and excess tax benefits from equity compensation of approximately $42.3 million. 2008 VERSUS 2007 Operating Cash provided by operating activities increased $36.1 million, or 24%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to substantially increased cash from our core operations and improvement in our working capital, which together added approximately $45.0 million in higher operating cash flow. Our working capital improved primarily due to improved collection of receivables. Also contributing to the improved cash flow was $12.0 million in lower cash payments related to severance, excess facilities, and settlement of litigation, and about $2.0 million less in interest paid on our debt as interest rates declined. The improved operating cash flow in 2008 was somewhat offset by higher cash payments for taxes and bonuses of approximately $23.0 million. Investing Cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to cash used of $24.1 million in 2007. We had capital expenditures of $24.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2008, which was offset by net cash proceeds from the sale of our Vision Events business of approximately $7.8 million. We had capital expenditures of $24.2 million in 2007. 23 Table of Contents Financing Cash used in financing activities totaled $119.8 million in 2008 compared to cash used of $93.7 million in 2007, an increase in cash used of $26.1 million. The increased use of cash was primarily due to a significantly higher use of cash for stock repurchases in 2008. We used an additional $34.0 million of cash to repurchase our shares in 2008, to $200.8 million in 2008 compared to $166.8 million in 2007. Partially offsetting the additional use of cash used for stock repurchases was an increase of $10.2 million in cash proceeds from stock issued for stock plans, which rose to $44.7 million in 2008 compared to $34.5 million in 2007, driven by higher option exercises. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS At December 31, 2009, we had $329.0 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement, which provides for two amortizing term loans and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional $100.0 million at our lenders discretion (the expansion feature ), for a total revolving credit facility of $400.0 million. However, the $100.0 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions. The term loans are being repaid in consecutive quarterly installments plus a final payment due on January 31, 2012, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at our option. The revolving loan facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until January 31, 2012, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. See Note 7 Debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Credit Agreement.

(2) Represent amounts due under the Credit Agreement. Amounts due under the revolver are classified in the 1-3 Years category since the amounts are not contractually due until January 31, 2012. Interest payments on our outstanding debt are excluded from the amounts payable due to the variable nature of the interest rates and resulting payment amounts. Information regarding current interest rates on the Company debt is contained in Note 7 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, cash interest paid on our debt was $13.9 million, $22.4 million, and $24.1 million, respectively. (3) Includes amounts payable consisting primarily of a portion of the purchase price related to our acquisition of Burton Group on December 30, 2009. These amounts were paid in January 2010. (4) Represents a liability under the Company supplemental deferred compensation arrangement. Amounts payable to active employees whose payment date is unknown have been included in the More Than 5 Years category since the Company cannot determine when the amounts will be paid. (5) Includes interest and penalties. In addition to the $1.3 million liability, approximately $13.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-6, Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements , which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements. ASU 2010-6 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2010-6 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
