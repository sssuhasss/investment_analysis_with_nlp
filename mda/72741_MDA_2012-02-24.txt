Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related combined notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References in this Annual Report to NU, the Company, we, us and our refer to Northeast Utilities and its consolidated subsidiaries. All per share amounts are reported on a diluted basis. Refer to the Glossary of Terms included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for abbreviations and acronyms used throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of NU. The earnings and EPS of each business discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a financial measure not recognized under GAAP that is calculated by dividing the Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests of each business by the weighted average diluted NU common shares outstanding for the period. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate earnings results and to provide details of earnings results and guidance by business. We believe that this measurement is useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our businesses. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to our consolidated diluted EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. The discussion below also includes non-GAAP financial measures referencing our 2011 earnings and EPS excluding expenses related to NU's pending merger with NSTAR and a non-recurring charge at CL&P for the establishment of a reserve to provide bill credits to its residential customers and donations to charitable organizations, as well as our 2010 earnings and EPS excluding merger expenses incurred in 2010 and certain non-recurring benefits from the settlement of tax issues. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to more fully compare and explain the 2011, 2010 and 2009 results without including the impact of these non-recurring items. Due to the nature and significance of these items on Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests, management believes that this non-GAAP presentation is more representative of our performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to reported Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of operating performance. Reconciliations of the above non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated diluted EPS and Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests are included under Financial Condition and Business Analysis Overview Consolidated and Financial Condition and Business Analysis Future Outlook in Management's Discussion and Analysis , herein. All forward-looking information for 2012 and thereafter provided in this Management Discussion and Analysis assumes we will operate on a stand-alone basis, excluding the impacts of the pending merger with NSTAR, unless otherwise indicated. Financial Condition and Business Analysis Pending Merger with NSTAR: On October 18, 2010, NU and NSTAR announced that each company's Board of Trustees unanimously approved a merger agreement (the agreement ), under which NSTAR will become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of NU. On October 14, 2011, NU and NSTAR extended the termination date of the agreement, as defined therein, from October 16, 2011 to April 16, 2012. The transaction is structured as a merger of equals in a tax-free exchange of shares. Under the terms of the agreement, NSTAR shareholders will receive 1.312 NU common shares for each NSTAR common share that they own (the exchange ratio ). Following the merger, NU will provide electric and natural gas energy delivery service to approximately 3.5 million electric and natural gas customers through six regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On March 4, 2011, NU shareholders approved the agreement, approved an increase in the number of NU common shares authorized for issuance by 155 million common shares to 380 million common shares and fixed the number of trustees at 14. NSTAR shareholders approved the agreement on March 4, 2011. Subject to the conditions in the agreement, our first quarterly dividend per common share paid after the closing of the merger will be increased to an amount that is at least equal, after adjusting for the exchange ratio, to NSTAR's last quarterly dividend paid prior to the closing. Completion of the merger is subject to various customary conditions, including, among others, receipt of all required regulatory approvals. NU and NSTAR are awaiting approvals from PURA and the DPU. PURA is scheduled to issue a final decision on April 2, 2012. On February 15, 2012, NU and NSTAR reached comprehensive merger-related settlement agreements with both the Massachusetts Attorney General and the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources agreeing to certain conditions with respect to the merger, which are subject to DPU approval and have been requested by the parties to be approved on April 4, 2012. If both PURA and the DPU issue acceptable decisions by such dates, we expect the merger will be consummated by April 16, 2012. For further information regarding regulatory approvals on the pending merger, see Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Regulatory Approvals for Pending Merger with NSTAR, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. 28 Executive Summary The following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this Annual Report: Results: We earned $394.7 million, or $2.22 per share, in 2011, compared with $387.9 million, or $2.19 per share, in 2010. Excluding merger-related costs of $11.3 million, or $0.06 per share, and a non-recurring charge at CL&P of $17.9 million, or $ 0.10 per share, we earned $423.9 million, or $2.38 per share, in 2011. The non-recurring charge at CL&P relates to the establishment of a reserve to provide bill credits to its residential customers and donations to charitable organizations ( storm fund reserve ). Improved results in 2011 were due primarily to the impact of electric distribution rate case decisions that were effective July 1, 2010 for CL&P and PSNH and February 1, 2011 for WMECO and the impact of a higher level of investment in transmission infrastructure. Our Regulated companies earned $420.4 million, or $2.36 per share, in 2011, including the $17.9 million CL&P storm fund reserve, compared with $384 million, or $2.16 per share, in 2010. The distribution segment of our Regulated companies earned $220.8 million, or $1.24 per share, in 2011, including the $17.9 million CL&P storm fund reserve, compared with $206.2 million, or $1.16 per share, in 2010. The transmission segment of our Regulated companies earned $199.6 million, or $1.12 per share, in 2011, compared with $177.8 million, or $1.00 per share, in 2010. NU parent and other companies recorded net expenses of $25.7 million, or $0.14 per share, in 2011, compared with earnings of $3.9 million, or $0.03 per share, in 2010. In 2011, excluding merger-related costs of $11.3 million, or $0.06 per share, NU parent and other companies recorded net expenses of $14.4 million, or $0.08 per share. In 2010, results included a non-recurring benefit of $15.7 million, or $0.09 per share, associated with the settlement of tax issues and a charge of $9.4 million, or $0.06 per share, associated with merger-related costs. 2011 Major Storm Items: On August 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive damage to our distribution system resulting in incremental restoration costs of $135.6 million, $123.8 million of which were incurred by CL&P. Approximately 800,000 of our 1.9 million electric distribution customers were without power at the peak of the outages. CL&P capitalized $18.2 million of the restoration costs and deferred $105.6 million for future recovery. On October 29, 2011, an unprecedented storm inundated our service territory with heavy snow causing significant damage to our distribution and transmission systems resulting in incremental restoration costs of $218.5 million, $22.6 million of which were capitalized and $195.9 million were deferred for future recovery. Approximately 1.2 million of our electric distribution customers were without power at the peak of the outages. This was the largest storm in CL&P and WMECO's history and third largest in PSNH history in terms of customer outages. CL&P portion of incremental restoration costs was $174.6 million, of which $16.9 million was capitalized and $157.7 million was deferred for future recovery. The storms met the regulatory criteria for cost deferral and as a result, except for the CL&P storm fund reserve, they had no material impact on our results of operations. We believe our response to the storm damage was prudent and therefore we believe it is probable that CL&P, PSNH and WMECO will be allowed to recover these storm costs. Each operating company will seek recovery of its estimated deferred storm costs through its applicable regulatory recovery process. CL&P recorded a storm fund reserve of $30 million ($17.9 million after-tax) to provide bill credits to its residential customers who remained without power after noon on Saturday, November 5, 2011 as a result of the October snowstorm, and to provide donations to certain Connecticut charitable organizations. CL&P will not seek to recover this amount in its rates. A number of governmental inquiries have been initiated in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts to review the response of utilities and other entities to Tropical Storm Irene and the October snowstorm. Certain reviews were completed while other inquiries are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012. Strategy, Legislative, Regulatory and Other Items: On June 29, 2011, the DPUC (now PURA) issued a final decision in the Yankee Gas rate proceeding that was amended on September 28, 2011. The decision resulted in essentially no changes to distribution rates for 2011 and an increase of approximately $7 million in Yankee Gas annual revenues beginning July 1, 2012. On September 30, 2011, several parties filed a joint complaint with the FERC alleging that the base ROE used in calculating formula rates for transmission service under the ISO-NE Open Access Transmission Tariff by New England transmission owners, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, is unjust and unreasonable, and seeking an order to reduce the rate from 11.14 percent to 9.2 percent. On October 20, 2011, the New England transmission owners filed their response seeking dismissal of the complaint on the basis that the complainants failed to demonstrate that the existing base ROE is unjust and unreasonable and provided testimony and analysis demonstrating that the 11.14 percent base ROE remains just and reasonable. The FERC has not yet issued an order in this proceeding. 29 On September 13, 2011, CL&P and WMECO received the required permit from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers allowing them to commence full construction of GSRP. The $718 million project is expected to be placed in service in late 2013. As of December 31, 2011, GSRP was approximately 50 percent complete. In September 2011, the Clean Air Project was placed in service at PSNH Merrimack Station. By November 2011, both of the Merrimack Station coal-fired units were integrated with the scrubber, which is reducing emissions from the units. Finalization of project activities, including water discharge enhancements, is expected in mid-2012. We expect the project will cost approximately $422 million. Yankee Gas WWL project was completed and placed in service in November 2011. Project costs totaled approximately $54 million, $3.6 million below the previous estimate of $57.6 million. On December 23, 2011, CL&P filed a siting application with the Connecticut Siting Council to build the 40-mile, $218 million Connecticut section of the IRP. In early 2012, National Grid is expected to file siting applications with regulators in Massachusetts and Rhode Island to build its sections of the IRP. We expect to receive approvals from all three states in late 2013 and to place the IRP in service by late 2015. Liquidity: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.6 million as of December 31, 2011, compared with $23.4 million as of December 31, 2010, while cash capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion in 2011, compared with $954.5 million in 2010. On February 14, 2012, our Board of Trustees declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.29375 per share, payable on March 30, 2012 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2012, which equates to $1.175 per share on an annualized basis. Assuming our pending merger with NSTAR closes in 2012 after NSTAR pays its March 30, 2012 dividend of $0.45 per share, the terms of the merger agreement would require NU's first quarterly dividend paid after the merger to be at least $0.343 per share, or at least $1.372 per share on an annualized basis. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2011 totaled $901.1 million, compared with $832.6 million in 2010 (amounts are net of RRB payments). The improved cash flows in 2011 were due primarily to the impact of the recent electric distribution rate case decisions and 2011 income tax refunds, as compared to 2010 income tax payments, partially offset by a Pension Plan contribution and cash disbursements associated with major storm costs. On a stand-alone basis, 2012 cash flows provided by operating activities, net of RRB payments, are expected to be lower than in 2011 due primarily to approximately $50 million more in Pension Plan contributions than in 2011 and approximately $27 million in bill credits provided to CL&P residential customers in February 2012. In 2011, we issued $260 million of new long-term debt consisting of $160 million by PSNH and $100 million by WMECO. Additionally, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt secured PCRBs in April 2011 and refinanced $245.5 million of PCRBs in October 2011. PSNH refinanced $119.8 million of PCRBs in May 2011. In April 2012, NU parent has a debt maturity of $263 million, which we expect will be refinanced. In addition to remarketing the CL&P $62 million PCRBs, we expect to issue $150 million of long-term debt comprised of $100 million by WMECO and $50 million by Yankee Gas in the second half of 2012. Overview Consolidated: A summary of our earnings by business, which also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of consolidated non-GAAP earnings and EPS, as well as EPS by business, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests and diluted EPS, for 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts) Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests (GAAP) $ 394.7 $ 2.22 $ 387.9 $ 2.19 $ 330.0 $ 1.91 Regulated Companies $ 438.3 $ 2.46 $ 384.0 $ 2.16 $ 323.5 $ 1.87 NU Parent and Other Companies (14.4) (0.08) (2.4) (0.00) 6.5 0.04 Non-GAAP Earnings 423.9 2.38 381.6 2.16 330.0 1.91 Non-Recurring Tax Settlements - - 15.7 0.09 - - Merger-Related Costs (11.3) (0.06) (9.4) (0.06) - - Storm Fund Reserve (17.9) (0.10) - - - - Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests (GAAP) $ 394.7 $ 2.22 $ 387.9 $ 2.19 $ 330.0 $ 1.91 Improved results in 2011 were due primarily to the impact of electric distribution rate case decisions that were effective July 1, 2010 for CL&P and PSNH and February 1, 2011 for WMECO, the impact of a higher level of investment in transmission infrastructure, colder than normal weather in the first quarter of 2011, continued cost management efforts, and the absence of a net charge of approximately $3 million, or approximately $0.02 per share, taken in the first quarter of 2010 associated with the enactment of the 2010 Healthcare 30 Act. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in NU parent and other companies' results, a second quarter 2011 refund to transmission wholesale customers, as compared to a recovery from those customers in 2010, lower retail electric sales in 2011, compared to 2010, as well as higher Pension and PBOP costs, depreciation, property taxes and the storm fund reserve. Regulated Companies: Our Regulated companies consist of the electric distribution and transmission segments, with the Yankee Gas natural gas distribution segment and PSNH and WMECO generation activities included in the distribution segment. A summary of our Regulated companies' earnings by segment for 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 CL&P Transmission $ 151.9 $ 143.9 $ 136.8 PSNH Transmission 24.1 20.7 18.0 WMECO Transmission 22.8 13.0 9.5 NPT 0.8 0.2 - Total Transmission 199.6 177.8 164.3 CL&P Distribution 110.6 94.1 74.0 PSNH Distribution 76.2 69.3 47.5 WMECO Distribution 20.2 10.1 16.7 Yankee Gas 31.7 32.7 21.0 Total Distribution 238.7 206.2 159.2 Subtotal - Regulated Companies Earnings Before Non-Recurring Charge $ 438.3 $ 384.0 $ 323.5 Storm Fund Reserve (1) $ (17.9) $ - $ - Net Income - Regulated Companies $ 420.4 $ 384.0 $ 323.5 (1) Attributable to the CL&P distribution segment. The increased 2011 transmission segment earnings as compared to 2010 were due primarily to a higher level of investment in transmission infrastructure, and a higher proportion of equity funding to support the transmission investments, partially offset by a 2011 refund to transmission wholesale customers, as compared to a recovery from those customers in 2010, primarily impacting CL&P. The increased 2010 transmission segment earnings as compared to 2009 reflect a higher level of investment in transmission infrastructure. Our transmission rate base totaled $2.96 billion at the end of 2011, compared with $2.76 billion at the end of 2010. CL&P 2011 distribution segment earnings, excluding the $17.9 million storm fund reserve, were $16.5 million higher than 2010 due primarily to the impact of the 2010 distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010 and included an incremental rate increase effective July 1, 2011, lower uncollectibles expense and lower income taxes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher Pension and PBOP costs, a 1.5 percent decrease in retail electric sales and higher depreciation and property taxes. CL&P distribution segment regulatory ROE was 9.4 percent in 2011, as compared to 7.9 percent in 2010. PSNH 2011 distribution segment earnings were $6.9 million higher than 2010 due primarily to higher revenues as a result of the permanent distribution rate increase effective July 1, 2010, and higher generation-related earnings, partially offset by the absence of the 2010 favorable impact of the distribution rate case settlement, which allowed for the recovery of certain actual expenses retroactive to August 1, 2009, higher property taxes and a 0.4 percent decrease in retail electric sales. PSNH distribution segment regulatory ROE was 9.7 percent in 2011, as compared to 10.2 percent in 2010. WMECO 2011 distribution segment earnings were $10.1 million higher than 2010 due primarily to the impact of the distribution rate case decision effective February 1, 2011 and lower operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by a $5.3 million pre-tax charge to establish a reserve related to a wholesale billing adjustment, and higher depreciation and amortization. WMECO distribution segment regulatory ROE was 9 percent in 2011, as compared to 4.6 percent in 2010. Yankee Gas 2011 earnings were $1 million lower than 2010 due primarily to higher pension and PBOP costs, the absence of a 2010 benefit related to the settlement of various tax matters, and higher depreciation and property taxes. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by higher revenues resulting from an 8 percent increase in total firm natural gas sales, and lower uncollectibles expense. Yankee Gas regulatory ROE was 9.3 percent in 2011, as compared to 8.6 percent in 2010. On August 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive damage to our distribution system resulting in incremental restoration costs of $135.6 million. Approximately 800,000 of our 1.9 million electric distribution customers were without power at the peak of the outages. On October 29, 2011, an unprecedented storm inundated our service territory with heavy snow causing significant damage to our distribution and transmission systems resulting in incremental restoration costs of $218.5 million. Approximately 1.2 million of our electric distribution customers were without power at the peak of the outages, with 810,000 of those customers in Connecticut, 237,000 in New Hampshire, and 140,000 in Massachusetts. In terms of customer outages, this was the most severe storm in CL&P history, surpassing Tropical Storm Irene; the third most severe in PSNH history, following a December 2008 ice storm and a February 2010 winter storm; and the most severe in WMECO's history. 31 Estimated incremental restoration costs related to the storms are summarized in the table below and consist of costs that are deferred for future recovery and costs that are capitalized: For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 (Millions of Dollars) Deferred for Future Recovery Capitalized Total Incremental Costs Tropical Storm Irene: CL&P $ 105.6 $ 18.2 $ 123.8 PSNH 7.0 1.1 8.1 WMECO 3.2 0.5 3.7 Total Tropical Storm Irene 115.8 19.8 135.6 October Snowstorm: CL&P 157.7 16.9 174.6 PSNH 14.7 2.2 16.9 WMECO 23.5 3.5 27.0 Total October Snowstorm 195.9 22.6 218.5 Total Storm Costs $ 311.7 $ 42.4 $ 354.1 The storms met the regulatory criteria for cost deferral in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts and as a result, except for the CL&P storm fund reserve, the storm costs had no material impact on the results of operations of CL&P, PSNH or WMECO. We believe our response to the storm damage was prudent and therefore we believe it is probable that CL&P, PSNH and WMECO will be allowed to recover these costs. Each operating company will seek recovery of its costs through its applicable regulatory recovery process. For further information regarding various reviews on storm response and preparedness, see Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - 2011 Major Storms, in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. CL&P recorded a pre-tax charge for a storm fund reserve of $30 million, in the fourth quarter of 2011, to provide bill credits to its residential customers who remained without power after noon on Saturday, November 5, 2011 as a result of the October snowstorm, and to provide contributions to certain Connecticut charitable organizations. Approximately $27 million of the storm fund reserve was used to provide a one-time credit on the February 2012 bills of approximately 192,000 CL&P customers and approximately $3 million was paid to charitable organizations in December 2011. CL&P will not seek to recover this non-recurring amount in its rates, which is approximately $17.9 million after-tax, or $0.10 per share. For the distribution segment of our Regulated companies, a summary of changes in CL&P, PSNH and WMECO retail electric GWh sales, as well as total sales and percentage changes, and Yankee Gas firm natural gas sales and percentage changes in million cubic feet for 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010, on an actual and weather normalized basis (using a 30-year average), is as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to 2010 CL&P PSNH WMECO Total Electric Electric Percentage Decrease Weather Normalized Percentage Decrease Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Weather Normalized Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Decrease Weather Normalized Percentage Decrease Sales (GWh) Percentage Decrease Weather Normalized Percentage Decrease Residential (1.0)% - % (1.1)% (0.8)% (0.6)% - % 14,766 14,913 (1.0)% (0.2)% Commercial (2.0)% (0.8)% 0.2% 1.1% (1.5)% (0.5)% 14,301 14,506 (1.4)% (0.3)% Industrial (2.2)% (1.2)% (0.2)% 1.4% (0.9)% (0.1)% 4,418 4,481 (1.4)% (0.2)% Other (0.8)% (0.8)% (4.3)% (4.3)% (0.6)% (0.6)% 327 330 (1.0)% (1.0)% Total (1.5)% (0.5)% (0.4)% 0.4% (1.0)% (0.2)% 33,812 34,230 (1.2)% (0.3)% For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to 2010 Firm Natural Gas Sales (million cubic feet) (1) Percentage Increase Weather Normalized Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Residential 13,508 13,403 0.8% (3.2)% Commercial 17,175 15,137 13.5% 9.8% Industrial 16,197 14,866 8.9% 8.0% Total 46,880 43,406 8.0% 5.1% Total, Net of Special Contracts (2) 38,197 35,038 9.0% 5.4% (1) The 2010 sales volumes for commercial customers have been adjusted to conform to current year presentation. (2) Special contracts are unique to the customers who take service under such an arrangement and generally specify the amount of distribution revenue to be paid to Yankee Gas regardless of the customers usage. Actual retail electric sales for all three electric companies were lower in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to milder weather in the summer of 2011, compared to warmer than normal weather in the summer of 2010. In 2011, cooling degree days in Connecticut and western Massachusetts were 20.9 percent lower than 2010, and in New Hampshire, cooling degree days were 23.7 percent lower than 32 2010. For WMECO, the fluctuations in retail electric sales no longer impact earnings as the DPU approved a sales decoupling plan effective February 1, 2011. Under this decoupling plan, WMECO now has an established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenues of $125.6 million that it is able to recover, which effectively breaks the relationship between kWhs consumed by customers and revenues recognized. On a weather-normalized basis, total retail electric sales decreased slightly in 2011, as compared to 2010. We believe the weather-normalized commercial sales for CL&P and WMECO decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, due to the slow economic recovery in these service areas. PSNH commercial sales increased in 2011 due to one large self-generating customer who experienced multiple generation outages and relied on PSNH for energy. Industrial sales for both CL&P and WMECO decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, due in part to weak manufacturing activity in Connecticut and western Massachusetts. Our commercial and industrial electric sales continue to be negatively impacted by distributed generation and conservation programs. Our firm natural gas sales are subject to many of the same influences as our retail electric sales, but have benefitted from migration of interruptible customers switching to firm service rates and the addition of gas-fired distributed generation in Yankee Gas' service territory. Actual firm natural gas sales in 2011 were 8 percent higher than 2010. Colder weather, especially in the first quarter of 2011, was a contributing factor to the higher sales. Heating degree days for 2011 in Connecticut were 6.4 percent higher than 2010. On a weather normalized basis, actual firm natural gas sales in 2011 were 5.1 percent higher than 2010. Our expense related to uncollectible receivable balances (our uncollectibles expense) is influenced by the economic conditions of our region. Fluctuations in our uncollectibles expense are mitigated from an earnings perspective because a portion of the total uncollectibles expense for each of the electric distribution companies is recovered through each company energy supply rate and recovered through its tariffs. Additionally, for CL&P and Yankee Gas, write-offs of uncollectible receivable balances attributable to qualified customers under financial or medical duress (hardship customers) are fully recovered through their respective tariffs. For 2011, our total pre-tax uncollectibles expense that impacts earnings was $11.7 million, as compared to $23.4 million in 2010. The improvement in 2011 uncollectibles expense was due in part to continued enhanced accounts receivable collection efforts and credit monitoring. NU Parent and Other Companies: NU parent and other companies (which includes our competitive businesses held by NU Enterprises) recorded net expenses of $25.7 million, or $0.14 per share, in 2011, compared with earnings of $3.9 million, or $0.03 per share, in 2010. In 2011, excluding merger-related costs of $11.3 million, or $0.06 per share, NU parent and other companies recorded net expenses of $14.4 million, or $0.08 per share. In 2010, results included a non-recurring benefit of $15.7 million, or $0.09 per share, associated with the settlement of tax issues and a charge of $9.4 million, or $0.06 per share, associated with merger-related costs. Future Outlook We are not providing stand-alone EPS guidance in 2012 due to our pending merger with NSTAR. However, we expect that a number of key factors will negatively impact earnings in 2012 as compared with 2011. They include higher untracked Pension expense, which is expected to increase after-tax expense by approximately $15 million, higher reliability-related spending by CL&P, and a higher effective tax rate for CL&P's transmission and distribution segments. We expect those factors to be partially offset by an expected increase in transmission rate base of more than $200 million by the end of 2012, lower NU parent interest costs, and the positive impact of distribution rate increases that were effective July 1, 2011 for CL&P and are expected to be effective on July 1, 2012 for Yankee Gas and PSNH. Liquidity Consolidated: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.6 million as of December 31, 2011, compared with $23.4 million as of December 31, 2010. In 2011, our subsidiaries issued a total of $260 million in new long-term debt, excluding the refinancing of CL&P and PSNH PCRBs described below. On September 13, 2011, PSNH issued $160 million of first mortgage bonds that will mature on September 1, 2021 carrying a coupon rate of 3.20 percent. The net proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings previously incurred in the ordinary course of business and for general working capital purposes. On September 16, 2011, WMECO issued $100 million of unsecured senior notes that will mature on September 15, 2021 carrying a coupon rate of 3.50 percent. The net proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings previously incurred due largely in part to construction costs. On April 1, 2011, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt secured PCRBs that were subject to mandatory tender. The PCRBs, which mature on May 1, 2031, carry a coupon rate of 1.25 percent and have a mandatory tender on April 1, 2012, at which time CL&P expects to remarket the bonds. On May 26, 2011, PSNH issued $122 million of first mortgage bonds with a coupon rate of 4.05 percent and a maturity date of June 1, 2021, and used the proceeds to redeem $119.8 million of tax-exempt 1992 Series D and 1993 Series E PCRBs, each with a maturity date of May 1, 2021 and a coupon rate of 6 percent. The refinancing is expected to reduce PSNH interest costs by approximately $2.2 million in 2012. On October 24, 2011, CL&P issued $120.5 million of PCRBs carrying a coupon of 4.375 percent that will mature on September 1, 2028, and $125 million of PCRBs carrying a coupon of 1.25 percent that mature on September 1, 2028 and are subject to mandatory tender on September 3, 2013. The proceeds of these issuances were used to refund $245.5 million of PCRBs that carried a coupon of 5.85 33 percent and had a maturity date of September 1, 2028. The refinancing is expected to reduce CL&P interest costs by approximately $7.5 million in 2012. In 2012, in addition to remarketing the CL&P $62 million PCRBs, NU parent has a debt maturity on April 1, 2012 of $263 million, which we expect will be refinanced, and Yankee Gas has an annual sinking fund requirement of $4.3 million. Also in 2012, we expect to issue $150 million of long-term debt comprised of $100 million by WMECO and $50 million by Yankee Gas in the second half of 2012. On November 30, 2011, the FERC granted authorization to allow CL&P to incur total short-term borrowings up to a maximum of $450 million effective January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. In anticipation of increasing its short-term debt availability, on February 15, 2012, CL&P filed an application with the FERC requesting authorization to increase CL&P total short-term borrowing capacity from a maximum of $450 million to a maximum of $600 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2011 totaled $901.1 million, compared with operating cash flows of $832.6 million in 2010 and $745 million in 2009 (all amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows). The improved cash flows were due primarily to the impact of the CL&P and PSNH 2010 distribution rate case decisions that were effective July 1, 2010 (the CL&P July 1, 2010 rate increase was deferred from customer bills until January 1, 2011), the WMECO distribution rate case decision that was effective February 1, 2011, and income tax refunds of $76.6 million in 2011 largely attributable to accelerated depreciation tax benefits, compared to income tax payments of $84.5 million in 2010. Offsetting these benefits was a contribution of $143.6 million made into our Pension Plan in 2011, compared to $45 million in 2010, and approximately $157 million of cash disbursements made in 2011 associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October snowstorm. The increase in operating cash flows from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to the absence in 2010 of costs incurred at PSNH and WMECO related to the major ice storm in December 2008 that were paid in the first quarter of 2009, a decrease in Fuel, Materials and Supplies attributable to a $31.8 million reduction in coal inventory levels at the PSNH generation business as ordered by the NHPUC, and increases in amortization on regulatory deferrals primarily attributable to 2009 activity within PSNH ES and CL&P CTA tracking mechanisms where such costs exceeded revenues resulting in an unfavorable cash flow impact in 2009. Offsetting these favorable cash flow impacts was a $45 million contribution made into our Pension Plan in September 2010. On a stand-alone basis, 2012 cash flows provided by operating activities, net of RRB payments, are expected to be lower than in 2011 due primarily to approximately $50 million more in Pension Plan contributions than in 2011 and approximately $27 million in bill credits provided to CL&P residential customers in February 2012. In 2012, cash payments for Tropical Storm Irene and the October storm costs are estimated to be approximately $160 million, as compared to 2011 payments of approximately $157 million. A summary of the current credit ratings and outlooks by Moody's, S&P and Fitch for senior unsecured debt of NU parent and WMECO and senior secured debt of CL&P and PSNH is as follows: Moody's S&P Fitch Current Outlook Current Outlook Current Outlook NU Parent Baa2 Stable BBB Watch-Positive BBB Watch-Positive CL&P A2 Stable A- Watch-Positive A- Positive PSNH A3 Stable A- Watch-Positive A- Stable WMECO Baa2 Stable BBB+ Watch-Positive BBB+ Stable On April 18, 2011, Fitch raised PSNH's senior secured rating to A- from BBB+ to better reflect the firm's notching policy for senior secured debt. On the same day, Fitch raised its outlook on CL&P to positive from stable in part to reflect improved cash flow metrics. On May 16, 2011, S&P raised all of its corporate credit ratings and debt ratings on NU and its regulated utilities by one notch due primarily to improved financial metrics at the companies. S&P maintained its Watch-Positive outlook pending consummation of NU merger with NSTAR. On July 14, 2011, Fitch affirmed its existing ratings and outlooks of NU parent, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. There were no changes to Moody ratings or outlooks for NU or its subsidiaries in 2011. We paid common dividends of $194.6 million in 2011, compared with $180.5 million in 2010 and $162.4 million in 2009. This reflects an increase of approximately 7.3 percent in our common dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2011. On February 14, 2012, our Board of Trustees declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.29375 per share, payable on March 30, 2012 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2012, which equates to $1.175 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend represented an increase of 6.8 percent over the $0.275 per share quarterly dividend paid in 2011. Assuming our pending merger with NSTAR closes in 2012 after NSTAR pays its March 30, 2012 dividend of $0.45 per share, the terms of the merger agreement would require NU's first quarterly dividend paid after the merger to be at least $0.343 per share, or at least $1.372 per share on an annualized basis. Our ability to pay common dividends is subject to approval by our Board of Trustees and our future earnings and cash flow requirements and may be limited by state statute, the leverage restrictions in our revolving credit agreement and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay common dividends to NU parent. The Federal Power Act limits the payment of dividends by CL&P, PSNH and WMECO to their respective retained earnings balances unless a higher amount is approved by FERC; PSNH is required to reserve an additional amount of retained earnings under its FERC hydroelectric license conditions. In addition, relevant state statutes may impose additional limitations on the payment of dividends by the Regulated companies. CL&P, PSNH, WMECO and Yankee Gas also are parties to a revolving credit agreement that imposes leverage restrictions. The merger agreement requires that our first quarterly dividend per common share paid after the closing of the merger be increased to an amount that is at least equal, after adjusting for the exchange ratio, to NSTAR's last quarterly dividend paid prior to the closing. We do not expect the restrictions will prevent NU from meeting its obligations under the merger agreement. 34 In 2011, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas paid $243.2 million, $58.8 million, $26.3 million, and $38.2 million, respectively, in common dividends to NU parent. In 2011, NU parent made equity contributions to CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas of $6.7 million, $120 million, $91.8 million, and $8.5 million, respectively. Cash capital expenditures included on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and described in this Liquidity section do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income. A summary of our cash capital expenditures by company for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 CL&P $ 424.9 $ 380.3 $ 435.7 PSNH 241.8 296.3 266.4 WMECO 238.0 115.2 105.4 Yankee Gas 98.2 82.5 54.8 NPT 24.9 7.5 - Other 48.9 72.7 45.8 Total $ 1,076.7 $ 954.5 $ 908.1 The increase in our cash capital expenditures was the result of higher transmission segment cash capital expenditures of $150.6 million, primarily at WMECO and NPT, as well as higher capital expenditures at Yankee Gas related to the WWL Project. Proceeds from Sale of Assets in 2011 of $46.8 million included on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows related to the sale of certain CL&P transmission assets. For further information, see Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Transmission Segment - Other in this Management's Discussion and Analysis . As of December 31, 2011, NU parent had $17.9 million of LOCs issued for the benefit of certain subsidiaries (including $4 million for CL&P and $5.4 million for PSNH) and $256 million of short-term borrowings outstanding under its $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The weighted-average interest rate on these short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2011 was 2.2 percent, based on a variable rate plus an applicable margin based on NU parent's credit ratings. NU parent had $226.1 million of borrowing availability on this facility as of December 31, 2011. CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas are parties to a joint unsecured revolving credit facility in a nominal aggregate amount of $400 million. As of December 31, 2011, CL&P and Yankee Gas had short-term borrowings outstanding under this facility of $31 million and $30 million, respectively, leaving $339 million of aggregate borrowing capacity available. The weighted-average interest rate on these short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2011 was 3.1 percent (4.03 percent for CL&P), which is based on a variable rate plus an applicable margin based on CL&P and Yankee Gas respective credit ratings. We will continue to monitor availability of our credit facilities to assure that we have an adequate borrowing capacity. Our credit facilities and indentures require that NU parent and certain of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio. As of December 31, 2011, all such companies were in compliance with these covenants. Refer to Note 8, Short-Term Debt, and Note 9, Long-Term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of material terms and conditions of these agreements. Business Development and Capital Expenditures Consolidated: Our consolidated capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income (all of which are non-cash factors), totaled $1.2 billion in 2011, $1 billion in 2010, and $969.2 million in 2009. These amounts included $51.9 million in 2011, $68.7 million in 2010, and $52.7 million in 2009 related to our corporate service companies, NUSCO and RRR. Regulated Companies: Capital expenditures for the Regulated companies totaled $1.2 billion ($467.2 million for CL&P, $291.7 million for PSNH, and $290.3 million for WMECO) in 2011. 35 Transmission Segment : Transmission segment capital expenditures increased by $198.5 million in 2011, as compared with 2010, due primarily to increases at WMECO related to the construction of GSRP. A summary of transmission segment capital expenditures by company in 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 CL&P $ 128.6 $ 107.2 $ 163.0 PSNH 68.1 49.1 59.4 WMECO 236.8 95.2 67.7 NPT 25.9 9.4 1.7 Totals $ 459.4 $ 260.9 $ 291.8 NEEWS: GSRP, a project that involves the construction of 115 KV and 345 KV overhead lines from Ludlow, Massachusetts to Bloomfield, Connecticut, is the first, largest and most complicated project within the NEEWS family of projects. On September 13, 2011, CL&P and WMECO received the required permit from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers allowing them to commence full construction on GSRP. The $718 million project is expected to be placed in service in late 2013. As of December 31, 2011, the project was approximately 50 percent complete. The Interstate Reliability Project, which includes CL&P construction of an approximately 40-mile, 345 KV overhead line from Lebanon, Connecticut to the Connecticut-Rhode Island border in Thompson, Connecticut where it will connect to transmission enhancements being constructed by National Grid, is our second major NEEWS project. In August 2010, ISO-NE reaffirmed the need for the Interstate Reliability Project, which we expect to place in service in late 2015 at a cost of $218 million. On December 23, 2011, CL&P filed a siting application with the Connecticut Siting Council to build the Connecticut section of the Interstate Reliability Project. In early 2012, National Grid is expected to file siting applications with regulators in Massachusetts and Rhode Island to build its sections of the project. The late 2015 expected in-service date assumes that all siting application approvals will be received from all three states in late 2013 with construction commencing in late 2013 or early 2014. The Central Connecticut Reliability Project, which involves construction of a $301 million new 345 KV overhead line from Bloomfield, Connecticut to Watertown, Connecticut, is the third major part of NEEWS. In March 2011, ISO-NE announced that it would review the Central Connecticut Reliability Project along with other central Connecticut projects as part of a study known as the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Study. We expect ISO-NE to issue preliminary need results and transmission solutions in 2013. Included as part of NEEWS are costs for associated reliability related projects, all of which have received siting approval and most of which are under construction. These projects began going into service in 2010 and will continue to go into service through 2013. Through December 31, 2011, CL&P and WMECO had capitalized $132.6 million and $334.7 million, respectively, in costs associated with NEEWS, of which $33.9 million and $197.8 million, respectively, were capitalized in 2011. The total expected cost of NU share of NEEWS is approximately $1.3 billion, of which $646 million and $616 million relate to CL&P and WMECO, respectively. On May 27, 2011, the FERC issued an order accepting CL&P and WMECO filing requesting changes to the ISO-NE Tariff in order to include 100 percent of the NEEWS CWIP in regional rate base effective June 1, 2011. As a result of this order, CL&P and WMECO ceased accruing AFUDC on NEEWS CWIP as of June 1, 2011, and NU local customers will receive appropriate credits for the return on CWIP they have paid. Northern Pass: On October 4, 2010, NPT and Hydro Renewable Energy, a subsidiary of HQ, entered into a TSA in connection with the Northern Pass transmission project, which will be constructed by NPT. Northern Pass is a planned HVDC transmission line from the Qu bec-New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire. Northern Pass will interconnect at the Qu bec-New Hampshire border with a planned HQ HVDC transmission line. Under the terms of the TSA, which was accepted by the FERC without modification in February 2011, NPT will sell to HQ affiliate Hydro Renewable Energy 1,200 MW of firm electric transmission rights over the Northern Pass for a 40-year term and charge cost-based rates. The projected cost-of-service calculation includes an ROE of 12.56 percent through the construction phase of the project, and during commercial operation, an ROE equal to the ISO-NE regional rates base ROE (currently 11.14 percent) plus 1.42 percent. The TSA rates will be based on a capital structure for NPT of 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity. During the development and the construction phases under the TSA, NPT will be reco rding non-cash AFUDC earnings. In October 2010, NPT filed the Northern Pass project design with ISO-NE for technical approval and filed a presidential permit application with the DOE, which seeks permission to construct and maintain facilities that cross the U.S.-Canada border in New Hampshire and connect to HQ Trans nergie's facilities in Qu bec. The DOE held seven meetings in New Hampshire in mid-March 2011 seeking public comment. In response to concerns raised at these meetings, NPT revised its application to request additional time during the public comment period to allow NPT to review alternative routes. On June 15, 2011, the DOE extended the scoping comment period for at least forty-five days after NPT files an alternative route with the DOE. Certain environmental studies will need to be completed in order to obtain DOE permits. We expect construction to begin in 2014 and the project to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. On February 8, 2012, the New Hampshire legislature passed a bill that could potentially prohibit the use of eminent domain for the development of any non-reliability electric transmission projects, such as Northern Pass. The bill is currently awaiting action by the 36 New Hampshire Governor. We are reviewing the potential impact of the bill on NPT, should it be enacted, including its effect on the project's route, cost and schedule. We believe that NPT will be able to acquire the necessary rights along an acceptable route, which would make it feasible to construct the project even if the bill is enacted. Given the ultimate design needs of the project, along with siting and permit requirements, which will vary depending upon the route ultimately selected, there is a possibility for further delay in commencement of construction. We currently estimate that NU's 75 percent share of the costs of the Northern Pass transmission project will be approximately $830 million and NSTAR 25 percent share of the costs of the Northern Pass transmission project will be approximately $280 million, for a combined total expected cost of approximately $1.1 billion (including capitalized AFUDC). Through December 31, 2011, we capitalized $37 million in costs associated with NPT. Other: On May 31, 2011, CL&P and the Connecticut Transmission Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative (CTMEEC), a non-profit municipal joint action transmission entity formed by several Connecticut municipal electric utilities, completed the sale by CL&P to CTMEEC of a segment of high voltage transmission lines built by CL&P in the town of Wallingford, Connecticut. The assets were sold at their net book value of $42.5 million, plus reimbursement of closing costs. CL&P is operating and maintaining the lines under an operations and maintenance agreement with CTMEEC. The transaction did not include the transfer of land or equipment not related to electric transmission service. The transaction did not impact our five-year capital plan and is already reflected in CL&P transmission rate base forecasts. Distribution Segment : A summary of distribution segment capital expenditures by company for 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 CL&P: Basic Business $ 166.6 $ 126.2 $ 104.6 Aging Infrastructure 112.3 104.0 104.1 Load Growth 59.6 75.2 74.3 Total CL&P 338.5 305.4 283.0 PSNH: Basic Business 47.7 41.2 55.5 Aging Infrastructure 25.3 19.5 17.8 Load Growth 25.8 23.1 25.5 Total PSNH 98.8 83.8 98.8 WMECO: Basic Business 24.2 17.5 21.5 Aging Infrastructure 11.5 10.5 12.2 Load Growth 6.1 5.1 4.0 Total WMECO 41.8 33.1 37.7 Total - Electric Distribution (excluding Generation) 479.1 422.3 419.5 Yankee Gas 102.8 94.6 59.6 Other 1.0 2.0 0.6 Total Distribution 582.9 518.9 479.7 PSNH Generation: Clean Air Project 101.1 149.7 119.3 Other 23.7 27.4 25.7 Total PSNH Generation 124.8 177.1 145.0 WMECO Generation 11.7 10.1 - Total Distribution Segment $ 719.4 $ 706.1 $ 624.7 For the electric distribution business, basic business includes the relocation of plant, the purchase of meters, tools, vehicles, and information technology. Aging infrastructure relates to the planned replacement of overhead lines, plant substations, transformer replacements, and underground cable replacement. Load growth includes requests for new business and capacity additions on distribution lines and substation overloads. The Clean Air Project is a wet scrubber project that PSNH constructed and placed in service at its Merrimack Station in September 2011, the cost of which will be recovered through PSNH's ES rates under New Hampshire law. By November 2011, both of Merrimack Station coal-fired units were integrated with the scrubber, which is reducing emissions from the units. We expect finalization of project activities, including water discharge enhancements, in mid-2012 at a cost of approximately $422 million. On August 12, 2009, the DPU authorized WMECO to install up to 6 MW of solar energy generation in its service territory at an estimated cost of $41 million by the end of 2012. In October 2010, WMECO completed development of a 1.8 MW solar generation facility on a site in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The full cost of this project was $9.4 million. In December 2011, WMECO completed development of a 2.3 MW solar generation facility on a 12-acre brownfield site in Springfield, Massachusetts. The full cost of the Springfield project was $11.4 million. WMECO is continuing its evaluation of sites suitable for development of the remaining 1.9 MW of the authorized 6 MW of capacity. Yankee Gas' WWL Project, a 16-mile natural gas pipeline between Waterbury and Wallingford, Connecticut and the increase of vaporization output of its LNG plant, was placed in service in November 2011. Project costs totaled approximately $54 million, $3.6 37 million below the previous estimate of $57.6 million. Pursuant to the June 29, 2011 rate case decision, the WWL Project was included in Yankee Gas rate base upon entering service. Projected Capital Expenditures and Rate Base Estimates: Excluding the impacts of the pending merger with NSTAR, a summary of the projected capital expenditures for the Regulated companies' electric transmission segment and their distribution segment (including generation) by company for 2012 through 2016, including our corporate service companies' capital expenditures on behalf of the Regulated companies, is as follows: Year (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2012-2016 Total CL&P Transmission $ 174 $ 108 $ 255 $ 245 $ 55 $ 837 PSNH Transmission 66 125 142 94 41 468 WMECO Transmission 193 132 111 73 1 510 NPT 40 22 178 238 334 812 Subtotal Transmission $ 473 $ 387 $ 686 $ 650 $ 431 $ 2,627 CL&P Distribution: Basic Business $ 129 $ 121 $ 113 $ 114 $ 112 $ 589 Aging Infrastructure 119 101 88 90 92 490 Load Growth 67 63 73 67 72 342 Total CL&P Distribution 315 285 274 271 276 1,421 PSNH Distribution: Basic Business 52 49 49 50 48 248 Aging Infrastructure 29 24 28 26 25 132 Load Growth 31 37 33 40 39 180 Total PSNH Distribution 112 110 110 116 112 560 WMECO Distribution: Basic Business 17 16 18 18 19 88 Aging Infrastructure 15 16 16 16 16 79 Load Growth 7 7 6 6 6 32 Total WMECO Distribution 39 39 40 40 41 199 Subtotal Electric Distribution $ 466 $ 434 $ 424 $ 427 $ 429 $ 2,180 PSNH Generation: Clean Air Project $ 21 $ 2 $ - $ - $ - $ 23 Other 13 26 29 34 34 136 Total PSNH Generation 34 28 29 34 34 159 CL&P Generation 11 23 11 - - 45 WMECO Generation 19 10 10 10 - 49 Subtotal Generation $ 64 $ 61 $ 50 $ 44 $ 34 $ 253 Yankee Gas Distribution: Basic Business $ 26 $ 27 $ 28 $ 29 $ 30 $ 140 Aging Infrastructure 48 50 50 52 53 253 Load Growth 20 46 47 35 23 171 Total Yankee Gas Distribution $ 94 $ 123 $ 125 $ 116 $ 106 $ 564 Corporate Service Companies $ 44 $ 52 $ 36 $ 30 $ 29 $ 191 Total $ 1,141 $ 1,057 $ 1,321 $ 1,267 $ 1,029 $ 5,815 Actual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and periods above. Economic conditions in the northeast could impact the timing of our major capital expenditures. Most of these capital expenditure projections, including those for NPT, assume timely regulatory approval, which in most cases requires extensive review. The amounts above assume that we receive favorable responses from regulators to our proposed capital program and that our major transmission initiatives, some of which have not yet been filed with regulators, are approved in a timely manner. Delays in or denials of those approvals could reduce the levels of expenditures and associated rate base. 38 Based on the 2011 actual and 2012 through 2016 projected capital expenditures, the 2011 actual and 2012 through 2016 projected transmission, distribution and generation rate base as of December 31 of each year are as follows: Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 (Millions of Dollars) CL&P Transmission $ 2,100 $ 2,149 $ 2,091 $ 2,211 $ 2,424 $ 2,450 PSNH Transmission 390 407 524 654 707 721 WMECO Transmission 467 615 722 747 853 814 NPT - - - - - 804 Total Transmission 2,957 3,171 3,337 3,612 3,984 4,789 CL&P Distribution 2,603 2,726 2,826 2,932 3,019 3,114 PSNH Distribution 836 888 959 1,008 1,065 1,108 WMECO Distribution 423 434 442 446 451 455 Total Electric Distribution 3,862 4,048 4,227 4,386 4,535 4,677 CL&P Generation - 9 29 35 31 28 PSNH Generation 759 726 683 673 663 652 WMECO Generation 18 31 37 43 48 43 Total Generation 777 766 749 751 742 723 Yankee Gas Distribution 754 771 812 866 987 1,042 Total $ 8,350 $ 8,756 $ 9,125 $ 9,615 $ 10,248 $ 11,231 Transmission Rate Matters and FERC Regulatory Issues CL&P, PSNH and WMECO and most other New England utilities, generation owners and marketers are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's generation and transmission facilities and the rules by which these parties participate in the wholesale markets and acquire transmission services. Under these arrangements, ISO-NE, a non-profit corporation whose board of directors and staff are independent from all market participants, serves as the regional transmission organization for New England. ISO-NE works to ensure the reliability of the New England transmission system, administers the independent system operator tariff, subject to FERC approval, oversees the efficient and competitive functioning of the regional wholesale power market and determines the portion of the costs of our major transmission facilities that are regionalized throughout New England. Transmission - Wholesale Rates: Our transmission rates recover our total transmission revenue requirements, ensuring that we recover all regional and local revenue requirements for providing transmission service. These rates provide for annual reconciliations to actual costs. The difference between billed and actual costs is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers. As of December 31, 2011, we were in a total net overrecovery position of $31.4 million, which will be refunded to customers in June 2012. Of this amount, the transmission segments of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO were in an overrecovery position of $18.6 million, $1.7 million and $11.1 million, respectively. Pursuant to a series of orders involving the ROE for regionally planned New England transmission projects, the FERC set the base ROE at 11.14 percent and approved incentives that increased the ROE to 12.64 percent for those projects that were in-service by the end of 2008. Beginning in 2009, the ROE for all regional transmission investment approved by ISO-NE is 11.64 percent, which includes the 50 basis points for joining the regional transmission organization. In addition, certain projects were granted additional ROE incentives by FERC under its transmission incentive policy. As a result, CL&P earns between 12.64 percent and 13.1 percent on its major transmission projects. On June 28, 2011, FERC denied a motion by several New England states to reconsider the financial incentives FERC had granted the vast majority of NEEWS investments in 2008. Those incentives include an incremental 125-basis points to FERC base New England transmission ROE, cash recovery of earnings and interest on NEEWS investments while the projects are under construction, and recovery of prudently incurred costs on projects that are abandoned. FERC Base ROE Complaint: On September 30, 2011, several New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates and other parties filed a joint complaint with the FERC under Sections 206 and 306 of the Federal Power Act alleging that the base ROE used in calculating formula rates for transmission service under the ISO-NE Open Access Transmission Tariff by New England transmission owners, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, is unjust and unreasonable. The complainants asserted that the current 11.14 percent rate, which became effective in 2006, is excessive due to changes in the capital markets and are seeking an order to reduce the rate to 9.2 percent, effective September 30, 2011. On October 20, 2011, the New England transmission owners responded to the complaint, asking FERC to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the complainants failed to carry their burden of proof under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to demonstrate that the existing base ROE is unjust and unreasonable. The New England transmission owners included testimony and analysis reflecting a base ROE of 11.2 percent using FERC methodology and precedents, which they believe demonstrates that the current base ROE of 11.14 percent remains just and reasonable. As of December 31, 2011, CL&P, PSNH, and WMECO had approximately $1.5 billion of aggregate shareholder equity invested in their transmission facilities. As a result, each 10 basis point change in the authorized base ROE would change annual consolidated earnings by an approximate $1.5 million. 39 Although additional testimony was submitted by the complainants and the New England transmission owners in November and December 2011, the FERC has not yet issued an order in this proceeding and we cannot predict when this proceeding will be concluded, the outcome of this proceeding, or its impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Legislative Matters 2010 and 2011 Connecticut Legislation : In May 2010, the Connecticut Legislature approved a state budget for the 2011 fiscal year, which called for the assessment of an Economic Transition Charge to electric utility customers and the issuance by the state of Connecticut of up to $760 million of economic recovery revenue bonds that would be repaid over eight years through additional charges on electric utility customer bills. On September 29, 2010, the PURA approved a financing order for the bonds, but due primarily to legal challenges the bonds were never issued. On June 21, 2011, Governor Malloy signed legislation approving the state budget for the 2012 fiscal year that revoked the authorization for the state to issue the economic recovery revenue bonds. As a result of this change in legislation, as of July 1, 2011 CL&P customer bills do not include the charge associated with the economic recovery revenue bonds of approximately $0.0038 per kWh. On July 1, 2011, Governor Malloy signed legislation that consolidated oversight of state energy and environmental activities into the DEEP. Effective July 1, 2011, the DPUC was replaced by PURA, which is part of the DEEP. The five commissioners of the DPUC were replaced by three directors of PURA. PURA regulates Connecticut utility rates and terms of service and oversees certain safety standards of the state utilities, but various policy responsibilities, including the state Integrated Resource Plan, have been assumed by a separate division within DEEP. The legislation also authorized the state electric distribution companies, including CL&P, to build up to 10 MW of renewable generation, and authorized DEEP to study the potential for increased natural gas usage in Connecticut, including usage as a transportation fuel. 2011 New Hampshire Legislation: On March 30, 2011, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved House Bill 648, which would preclude companies constructing non-reliability projects, such as Northern Pass, from using eminent domain to acquire property for construction of such projects. On June 2, 2011, the New Hampshire Senate voted to send House Bill 648 back to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further study. On December 8, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee endorsed a number of changes to the state eminent domain legislation, but those changes did not include a ban on using eminent domain for non-reliability projects. On February 8, 2012, the New Hampshire legislature passed a bill that could potentially prohibit the use of eminent domain for development of any non-reliability electric transmission projects, such as Northern Pass. The bill is currently awaiting action by the New Hampshire Governor. For further information regarding the impacts to NPT, see Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Transmission Segment Northern Pass in this Management's Discussion and Analysis . Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Regulatory Approvals for Pending Merger with NSTAR: Federal: On February 10, 2012, the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired. On December 21, 2011, the Federal Communications Commission extended its approval until July 7, 2012. On July 6, 2011, FERC issued its approval of the merger. On December 20, 2011, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued two orders approving the indirect transfer of control of the operating licenses for Yankee Nuclear Power Station and Haddam Neck Plant held by YAEC and CYAPC, which will be effected upon the merger of NU and NSTAR. Massachusetts: On November 24, 2010, NU and NSTAR filed a joint petition requesting the DPU approval of our pending merger. On March 10, 2011, the DPU issued an order that modified the standard of review to be applied in the review of mergers involving Massachusetts utilities from a no net harm standard to a net benefits standard, meaning that the companies must demonstrate that the pending transaction provides benefits that outweigh the costs. NU and NSTAR filed supplemental testimony and a net benefit analysis with the DPU on April 8, 2011, estimating post-transaction net savings of approximately $780 million in the first 10 years following the closing of the merger and other customer benefits. An effective date for the merger of October 1, 2011 was used in the development of the net benefit study that was filed with the DPU. Evidentiary hearings began July 6, 2011 and concluded on July 28, 2011. Briefs in the case were filed with the DPU in September and October 2011. On July 15, 2011, the DOER filed a motion to stay the proceedings. On July 21, 2011, NU and NSTAR filed a response objecting to this motion. The DPU originally scheduled oral arguments for November 4, 2011 regarding the motion, which were further postponed during the fourth quarter of 2011 while NU, NSTAR and other parties made attempts to narrow and discuss the issues presented by the motion to stay. On January 6, 2012, oral arguments on the motion to stay were conducted. On February 15, 2012, NU and NSTAR reached comprehensive merger-related settlement agreements with both the Massachusetts Attorney General and the DOER. The first settlement agreement was reached with both the Attorney General and the DOER and covers a variety of rate-making and rate design issues, including a distribution rate freeze until 2016 for WMECO, NSTAR Electric Company and NSTAR Gas Company. The second settlement agreement was reached with the DOER and covers a variety of matters impacting the advancement of Massachusetts clean energy goals established by the Green Communities Act and Global Warming Solutions Act. Pursuant to the terms and provisions of the settlement agreements, all parties agree that the proposed merger between NU and NSTAR is consistent with the public interest and should be approved by the DPU. However, the settlement agreements allow the Attorney General and DOER to terminate their respective agreements for any reason at any time prior to approval by the DPU. All parties to the settlement agreements have requested that the DPU approve the merger on April 4, 2012. Connecticut: In December 2010, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, supported by the Connecticut Attorney General, petitioned the DPUC (now PURA) to reconsider its earlier view from November 2010 that it lacked jurisdiction. On June 1, 2011, the 40 PURA issued a decision stating that it lacked jurisdiction over the merger. On June 30, 2011, the Office of Consumer Counsel filed an appeal of the PURA's final decision. NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) and the New England Power Generators Association (NEPGA) filed similar appeals in July 2011 and filed petitions with the Connecticut Superior Court in July 2011, each requesting a declaratory ruling that the PURA has jurisdiction over the merger. On January 18, 2012, the PURA issued a final decision in which it revised its earlier declaratory ruling of June 1, 2011 that concluded it did not have jurisdiction to review the pending merger between NU and NSTAR. The final decision ruled that NU and NSTAR must now seek approval from PURA pursuant to Connecticut state law prior to completing the merger. As a result, on January 19, 2012, NU and NSTAR filed with PURA an application for approval of the merger. PURA is scheduled to issue a final decision on April 2, 2012. If both the DPU and PURA issue acceptable decisions by such dates, we expect the merger will be consummated by April 16, 2012. New Hampshire : On April 5, 2011, the NHPUC issued an order concluding that it does not have jurisdiction over the merger. Maine: On May 10, 2011, the Maine Public Utilities Commission approved the merger, subject to FERC approval, which was received on July 6, 2011. Federal: EPA Air Toxic Standard: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, a rule that establishes emission limits for hazardous air pollutants, including mercury and arsenic, from new and existing coal- and oil-fired electric generating units. The standards are the first to implement a nationwide emissions standard for hazardous air pollutants across all electric generating units, providing utility companies up to five years to meet the requirements. PSNH owns and operates approximately 1,000 MW of fossil fuel electric generating units, subject to these standards, including the Merrimack, Newington and Schiller stations. We believe the Clean Air Project at our Merrimack Station, along with existing equipment, enables that facility to meet at least the minimum requirements in the standards. A review of the potential impact of this rule on PSNH other generating units is not yet complete. However, PSNH believes that the work it has undertaken in recent years to comply with New Hampshire state regulations, including the Clean Air Project, will allow it to meet the new EPA Mercury and Air Toxic Standards without significant additional investment. EPA Proposed NPDES Permit: PSNH maintains a NPDES permit consistent with requirements of the Clean Water Act for Merrimack Station. In 1997, PSNH filed in a timely manner for a renewal of this permit. As a result, the existing permit was administratively continued. On September 29, 2011, the EPA issued a draft renewal NPDES permit for PSNH's Merrimack Station for public review and comment. The proposed permit contains many significant conditions to future operation. The proposed permit would require PSNH to install a closed-cycle cooling system (including cooling towers) at the station. The EPA estimated that the net present value cost to install this system and operate it over a 20-year period would be approximately $112 million. On October 27, 2011, the EPA extended the initial 60-day period for public review and comment on the draft permit for an additional 90 days until February 28, 2012. The EPA does not have a set deadline to consider comments and to issue a final permit. Given the complex and unprecedented nature of many of the requirements, extensive comments to the EPA on the draft permit are anticipated from within the utility industry as well as from various environmental groups. Merrimack Station is permitted to continue to operate under its present permit pending issuance of the final permit and subsequent resolution of matters appealed by PSNH and other parties. Due to the site specific characteristics of PSNH's other fossil generating stations, we believe it is unlikely that they would have similar permit requirements imposed on them. 2011 Major Storms: On June 1, 2011, a series of severe thunderstorms with high winds, including tornadoes, struck portions of WMECO service territory. Approximately 17,000 WMECO electric distribution customers were without power. On June 9, 2011, another series of severe thunderstorms with high winds struck CL&P, PSNH and WMECO's service territories, resulting in power outages for approximately 260,000 electric distribution customers, including 210,000 at CL&P. On August 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused extensive damage to our distribution system. Approximately 800,000 of our 1.9 million electric distribution customers were without power at the peak of the outages, with approximately 670,000 of those customers in Connecticut. On October 29, 2011, an unprecedented storm inundated our service territory with heavy snow causing significant damage to our distribution and transmission systems. Approximately 1.2 million of our electric distribution customers were without power at the peak of the outages, with 810,000 of those customers in Connecticut, 237,000 in New Hampshire, and 140,000 in Massachusetts. In terms of customer outages, this was the most severe storm in CL&P history, surpassing Tropical Storm Irene; the third most severe in PSNH history, following a December 2008 ice storm and a February 2010 wind storm; and the most severe in WMECO's history. CL&P recorded a pre-tax charge for a storm fund reserve of $30 million to provide bill credits to its residential customers who remained without power after noon on Saturday, November 5, 2011 as a result of the October snowstorm, and to provide contributions to certain Connecticut charitable organizations. CL&P will not seek to recover this amount in its rates. The magnitude of the storms costs and damages met the criteria for cost deferral in Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts and as a result, except for the CL&P storm fund reserve, the storms had no material impact on the results of operations of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. We believe our response to all storms was prudent and therefore we believe it is probable that CL&P, PSNH and 41 WMECO will be allowed to recover these storm costs. Each operating company will seek recovery of its estimated deferred storm costs through its applicable regulatory recovery process. Officials in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts have all initiated inquiries into their state's utilities response to the October snowstorm, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. In addition, the PURA has included a review of the utilities' responses during Tropical Storm Irene and hired a consultant for the purposes of conducting a management audit into the emergency response programs of CL&P. These inquiries are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012. Connecticut Governor Malloy appointed a panel to review the preparedness of numerous state entities, including the state's utilities, in the event of a category 3 hurricane. This panel made its recommendations on January 9, 2012. Governor Malloy also hired Witt Associates to provide an independent assessment of the state's and CL&P's preparedness, response and restoration efforts during the October snowstorm. The Witt Associates Final Report was issued on December 1, 2011. Numerous committees of the Connecticut General Assembly also held hearings covering all aspects of storm response in the state. No official report is expected from these committees. We are currently evaluating several long-term initiatives to address the findings and recommendations of the panel and Witt Associates' Final Report. We believe that, if adopted, the future costs associated with these new long-term initiatives will be recovered from customers. Connecticut CL&P: AMI: On August 29, 2011, PURA issued a draft decision rejecting the full deployment of AMI meters to all of CL&P customers at that time. PURA instead indicated that CL&P should begin installing AMI meters at a more moderate pace once industry standards are developed and CL&P has selected a specific technology to install. On September 2, 2011, the Commissioner of DEEP filed a motion with PURA to suspend the proceeding while the Bureau of Energy and Technology Policy conducts a process to establish an AMI policy for Connecticut, in accordance with the state law. On September 8, 2011, PURA granted DEEP motion and suspended its proceedings. No further schedule is available at this time from either DEEP or PURA. As a result, CL&P has removed the projected AMI capital costs of approximately $257 million from its current five-year capital program. Standard Service and Last Resort Service Rates: CL&P's residential and small commercial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under SS rates, and large commercial and industrial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under LRS rates. CL&P is fully recovering from customers the costs of its SS and LRS services. Effective January 1, 2012, the PURA approved a decrease to CL&P total average SS rate of approximately 8 percent and an increase to CL&P total average LRS rate of approximately 10.6 percent. The energy supply portion of the total average SS rate decreased from 9.732 cents per kWh to 8.443 cents per kWh while the energy supply portion of the total average LRS rate increased from 7.202 cents per kWh to 8.605 cents per kWh. CTA and SBC Reconciliation and Rates : On March 31, 2011, CL&P filed with the PURA its 2010 CTA and SBC reconciliation, which compared CTA and SBC revenues to revenue requirements. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, total CTA revenue requirements exceeded CTA revenues by $4.5 million. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, the SBC revenues exceeded SBC revenue requirements by $19.8 million. On October 12, 2011, PURA approved the 2010 CTA and SBC reconciliations as filed. The decision allowed a CTA rate, effective January 1, 2012, that would recover $26.1 million during 2012, and requires CL&P to provide updated actual and projected costs when it files its requested rate adjustments for January 1, 2012. The decision also allowed an SBC rate, effective January 1, 2012, that would collect $23.7 million during 2012. On December 22, 2011, PURA approved new CTA and SBC rates, effective January 1, 2012, using updated information provided by CL&P. Based on that updated information, the CTA rate will decrease from 0.332 cents per kWh to 0.128 cents per kWh, and the SBC will increase from 0.037 cents per kWh to 0.143 cents per kWh. FMCC Filing: On February 4, 2011, CL&P filed with the PURA its semi-annual filing, which reconciled actual FMCC revenues and charges and GSC revenues and expenses, for the period July 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010, and also included the previously filed revenues and expenses for the January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2010 period. The filing identified a total net overrecovery of $0.3 million, which includes the remaining uncollected or non-refunded portions from previous filings. A hearing was held during the second quarter of 2011 and on June 29, 2011, the PURA issued a final decision accepting CL&P calculations of GSC, bypassable FMCC and nonbypassable FMCC revenues and expenses for the period July 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. On August 1, 2011, CL&P filed with the PURA its semi-annual FMCC filing for the period January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011. The filing identified a total net overrecovery of $10.9 million for the period, which includes the remaining uncollected or non-refunded portions from previous filings. A hearing was held during the fourth quarter of 2011 and on December 28, 2011, the PURA issued a final decision accepting CL&P calculations of GSC, bypassable FMCC and nonbypassable FMCC actual revenues and expenses for the six months reviewed in the proceeding. On February 2, 2012, CL&P filed with the PURA its semi-annual FMCC filing for the period July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, and also included the previously filed revenues and expenses for the January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011 period. The filing identified a total net overrecovery of $18.7 million, which includes the remaining uncollected or non-refunded portions from previous filings. PURA has not yet set a schedule to review this filing, but we do not expect the outcome of the PURA's review to have a material adverse impact on CL&P's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Procurement Fee Rate Proceedings: In prior years, CL&P submitted to the PURA its proposed methodology to calculate the variable incentive portion of its transition service procurement fee, which was effective for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, and requested approval of the pre-tax $5.8 million 2004 incentive fee. CL&P has not recorded amounts related to the 2005 and 2006 procurement fee in earnings. CL&P recovered the $5.8 million pre-tax amount, which was recorded in 2005 earnings, through a CTA reconciliation process. On January 15, 2009, the PURA issued a final decision in this docket reversing its December 2005 draft decision and stated that CL&P was not eligible for the procurement incentive compensation for 2004. A $5.8 million pre-tax charge (approximately $3.5 million net of tax) was recorded in the 2008 earnings of CL&P, and an obligation to refund the $5.8 million to customers was established 42 as of December 31, 2008. CL&P filed an appeal of this decision on February 26, 2009. On February 4, 2010, the Connecticut Superior Court reversed the PURA decision. The Court remanded the case back to the PURA for the correction of several specific errors. On February 22, 2010, the PURA appealed the Connecticut Superior Court February 4, 2010 decision to the Connecticut Appellate Court, which then transferred the appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court. A decision is expected from the Connecticut Supreme Court in the second half of 2012. Connecticut - Yankee Gas: Distribution Rates: On June 29, 2011, PURA issued a final decision in the Yankee Gas rate proceeding that it amended on September 28, 2011. The final decision approved a regulatory ROE of 8.83 percent, based on a capital structure of 52.2 percent common equity and 47.8 percent debt, approved Yankee Gas WWL Project, and also allowed for an increase for bare steel and cast iron pipe annual replacement funding, as requested by Yankee Gas. The changes were effective July 20, 2011 and will have the effect of decreasing revenues by $0.2 million for the twelve months ending June 30, 2012 and increasing revenues by $6.9 million for the twelve months ending June 30, 2013. New Hampshire: Distribution Rates: In March 2011, PSNH filed with the NHPUC to collect certain exogenous costs, step increases, and storm costs, as permitted by its 2010 rate case settlement. These rate increases were offset by the scheduled termination, on June 30, 2011, of a rate recoupment charge, also from the 2010 rate case settlement. During the second quarter of 2011, the NHPUC issued rate orders approving net increases in revenue requirements effective July 1, 2011 to (1) recover exogenous costs, (2) implement a step increase program for capital additions and the reliability enhancement program, and (3) allow for the recovery of the 2010 windstorm costs. Together with the scheduled termination of the rate recoupment charge, the net impact of these rate changes was a $2.4 million decrease in rates effective July 1, 2011. ES, SCRC, and TCAM Filings : During the second quarter of 2011, PSNH filed with the NHPUC requests for ES, SCRC and TCAM rates of 8.89 cents per kWh, 1.09 cents per kWh, and 1.189 cents per kWh, respectively, to be effective July 1, 2011. On June 28, 2011, the NHPUC issued orders approving the ES and SCRC rates as filed, and on June 29, 2011, the NHPUC issued an order approving the TCAM rate as filed. On July 26, 2011, the NHPUC ordered PSNH to file a rate proposal that would mitigate the impact of customer migration expected to occur when the ES rate is higher than market prices. On January 26, 2012, the NHPUC rejected the PSNH proposal and ordered PSNH to file a new proposal no later than June 30, 2012, addressing certain issues raised by the NHPUC. On November 22, 2011, the NHPUC opened a docket to place the Clean Air Project into ES rates, including conducting a prudence review and establishing temporary rates. Hearings are scheduled on temporary rates for March 12 and 13, 2012. Following hearings on temporary rates, it is expected that recovery of costs of the Clean Air Project will begin during the second quarter of 2012. No formal schedule for the comprehensive prudence review or for permanent rates has been established. On December 30, 2011, the NHPUC issued an order establishing an ES rate of 8.31 cents per kWh, effective January 1, 2012, as opposed to the previous 8.89 cents per kWh. In September 2011, PSNH filed a petition with the NHPUC requesting a change in its SCRC annual rate for the period January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. In mid-December 2011, PSNH filed updated values, which set the proposed SCRC rate at 1.23 cents per kWh. In late December 2011, the NHPUC approved the SCRC rate as filed. ES and SCRC Reconciliation: On an annual basis, PSNH files with the NHPUC an ES/SCRC cost reconciliation filing for the preceding year. On April 29, 2011, the NHPUC approved a settlement between PSNH and the NHPUC staff regarding PSNH 2009 ES/SCRC reconciliation filing. The settlement did not have a material impact on PSNH's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On May 2, 2011, PSNH filed its 2010 ES/SCRC reconciliation with the NHPUC, whose evaluation includes a prudence review of PSNH's generation and power purchase activities. In November 2011, PSNH and the NHPUC staff reached a settlement regarding PSNH 2010 ES/SCRC reconciliation filing. The settlement did not have a material impact on PSNH's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The NHPUC held a hearing on the settlement in late November 2011, and issued an order approving the settlement on January 26, 2012. As of December 31, 2011, PSNH had ES and SCRC regulatory assets of $17.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which are being recovered from customers in 2012. Merrimack Clean Air Project: On July 7, 2009, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee (NHSEC) determined that PSNH's Clean Air Project was not subject to the NHSEC review as a sizeable addition to a power plant under state law. The NHSEC upheld its decision in an order dated January 15, 2010, denying requests for rehearing. This order was appealed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court on February 23, 2010. On July 21, 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that the appellants lacked standing to file their original action with the NHSEC, and that the NHSEC erred in entertaining the appellants' filing. The Court vacated the NHSEC decision, confirming PSNH's position that NHSEC approval was not necessary. 43 Massachusetts: Basic Service Rates : In 2011, WMECO fixed basic service rates ranged from 6.993 cents per kWh to 6.998 cents per kWh for residential customers, 7.498 cents per kWh to 8.006 cents per kWh for small commercial and industrial customers, and 6.958 cents per kWh to 7.450 cents per kWh for medium and large commercial and industrial customers. Effective January 1, 2012, WMECO rates for all basic service customers increased to reflect the basic service solicitations conducted by WMECO in November 2011. WMECO fixed basic service rates for residential customers increased to 7.715 cents per kWh, fixed rates for small commercial and industrial customers increased to 8.238 cents per kWh and fixed rates for large commercial and industrial customers increased to 8.451 cents per kWh. The fixed price increased by 0.753 cents per kWh for street lighting customers to 6.403 cents per kWh. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our management communicates to and discusses with our Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. See the combined notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Regulatory Accounting: The accounting policies of the Regulated companies conform to GAAP applicable to rate-regulated enterprises and historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process. The application of accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers. We use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe it is probable that the Regulated companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded. If we determined that we could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to our operations, or that we could not conclude that it is probable that costs would be recovered or reflected in future rates, the costs would be charged to earnings in the period in which the determination is made. For further information, see Note 2, Regulatory Accounting, to the consolidated financial statements. Unbilled Revenues: The determination of retail energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers is based on the reading of meters, which occurs regularly throughout the month. Billed revenues are based on these meter readings and the majority of recorded annual revenues is based on actual billings. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimates, and an estimated amount of unbilled revenues is recorded. Unbilled revenues represent an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues are included in Operating Revenues on the statement of income and are assets on the balance sheet that are reclassified to Accounts Receivable in the following month as customers are billed. Such estimates are subject to adjustment when actual meter readings become available, when there is a change in estimates and under other circumstances. The Regulated companies estimate unbilled revenues monthly using the daily load cycle method. The daily load cycle method allocates billed sales to the current calendar month based on the daily load for each billing cycle. The billed sales are subtracted from total month load, net of delivery losses, to estimate unbilled sales. Unbilled revenues are estimated by first allocating sales to the respective customer classes and then applying an average rate by customer class to the estimate of unbilled sales. The estimate of unbilled revenues is sensitive to numerous factors, such as energy demands, weather and changes in the composition of customer classes that can significantly impact the amount of revenues recorded. For further information, see Note 1L, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues, to the consolidated financial statements. Pension and PBOP: Our subsidiaries participate in a Pension Plan covering certain of our regular employees and in a PBOP Plan to provide certain health care benefits, primarily medical and dental, and life insurance benefits to retired employees. For each of these plans, the development of the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, funded status and net periodic benefit cost is based on several significant assumptions. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually and adjust them as necessary. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Pre-tax net periodic pension expense (excluding SERP) for the Pension Plan was $127.7 million, $80.4 million and $39.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The pre-tax net PBOP Plan expense was $43.6 million, $41.6 million and $37.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 44 We develop key assumptions for purposes of measuring the plans liabilities as of December 31 and expenses for the subsequent year. These assumptions include the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate, and health care cost trend rates and are discussed below. Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets : In developing this assumption, we consider historical and expected returns and input from our actuaries and consultants. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class. We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate. We used an aggregate expected long-term rate of return assumption of 8.25 percent on Pension and PBOP Plan assets as of December 31, 2011. Discount Rate : Payment obligations related to the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan are discounted at interest rates applicable to the timing of the plans cash flows. The discount rate that is utilized in determining the pension and PBOP obligations is based on a yield-curve approach. This approach is based on a population of bonds with an average rating of AA based on bond ratings by Moody s, S&P and Fitch, and uses bonds with above median yields within that population. The discount rates determined on this basis are 5.03 percent for the Pension Plan and 4.84 percent for the PBOP Plan as of December 31, 2011 and 5.57 percent and 5.28 percent for the respective plans as of December 31, 2010. Compensation/Progression Rate : This assumption reflects the expected long-term salary growth rate, which impacts the estimated benefits that pension plan participants receive in the future. We used a compensation/progression rate of 3.5 percent as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, which reflects our current expectation of future salary increases, including consideration of the levels of increases built into union contracts. Actuarial Determination of Expense : Pension and PBOP expense are determined by our actuaries and consist of service cost and prior service cost, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and amortization of the net transition obligation, offset by the expected return on plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses represent differences between assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions. We determine the expected return on plan assets by applying our assumed rate of return to a four-year rolling average fair values, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This calculation recognizes investment gains or losses over a four-year period from the years in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the calculated expected return and the actual return or loss based on the change in the fair value of assets during the year. As of December 31, 2011, investment losses that remain to be reflected in the calculation of plan assets over the next four years were $369 million and $5.8 million for the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan, respectively. As investment gains and losses are reflected in the average plan asset fair values, they are subject to amortization with other unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. The plans currently amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses as a component of pension and PBOP expense over the average future employee service period of approximately 10 and 9 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, the net unrecognized actuarial losses on the Pension and PBOP Plan liabilities, subject to amortization, were $819.3 million and $202.5 million, respectively. Forecasted Expenses and Expected Contributions : Based upon the assumptions and methodologies discussed above, we estimate that forecasted expense for the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan will be $167.9 million and $44.7 million, respectively, in 2012. Pension and PBOP expense for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans. Pension and PBOP expense charged to earnings is net of the amounts capitalized. We expect to continue our policy to contribute to the PBOP Plan at the amount of PBOP expense, excluding curtailments and special benefit amounts and adding contributions for the amounts received from the federal Medicare subsidy. NU's policy is to annually fund the Pension Plan in an amount at least equal to what will satisfy the requirements of ERISA, as amended by the PPA, and the Internal Revenue Code. NU's Pension Plan has historically been well funded, and a contribution was not required to be made from 1991 until the third quarter of 2010, when PSNH made a contribution to the plan of $45 million. NU made contributions totaling $143.6 million in 2011, $112.6 million of which were contributed by PSNH. Our Pension Plan funded ratio (the value of plan assets divided by the funding target in accordance with the requirements and guidelines of the PPA) was 80 percent as of January 1, 2011. We currently estimate that quarterly contributions aggregating to a total of $197.3 million will be made in 2012. Sensitivity Analysis : The following represents the hypothetical increase to the Pension Plan (excluding SERP) and PBOP Plan reported annual cost as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points (in millions): As of December 31, Pension Plan Cost Postretirement Plan Cost Assumption Change 2011 2010 2011 2010 Lower long-term rate of return $ 10.3 $ 10.7 $ 1.3 $ 1.2 Lower discount rate $ 14.2 $ 13.4 $ 2.3 $ 2.2 Higher compensation increase $ 6.5 $ 6.1 $ N/A N/A Pension Plan Contributions Discount Rate Sensitivity Analysis: Fluctuations in the average discount rate used to calculate expected Pension Plan contributions can have a significant impact on the amount of Pension Plan contributions estimated to be required. As of December 31, 2011, the average discount rate (segment rate) used to calculate funding target and to determine the expected Pension Plan contributions totaling $590 million for the period 2013 through 2016 was approximately 5.5 percent. If this discount rate was decreased by 50 basis points, all other items remaining constant, then the expected aggregate contributions would increase to 45 approximately $710 million for the period 2013 through 2016. In addition, the market performance of existing plan assets, the valuation of the plan's liabilities, and a variety of other factors would impact the Pension Plan contributions. Health Care Cost : The health care cost trend assumption used to project increases in medical costs was 7 percent for determining 2011 PBOP Plan expense. For 2012 and 2013, the rate is 7 percent, subsequently decreasing one half percentage point per year to an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2017. The effect of a hypothetical increase in the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would be to have increased service and interest cost components of PBOP Plan expense by $1.2 million in 2011, with a $16.2 million impact on the postretirement benefit obligation. See Note 10A, Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based test that requires us to use estimates and judgment. We have selected October 1 st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment testing date. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. If goodwill were deemed to be impaired, it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment. We determine the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model methodology. This methodology uses a weighted average cost of capital in which the ROE is developed using risk-free rates, equity premiums and a beta representing Yankee Gas' volatility relative to the overall market. The resulting discount rate is intended to be comparable to a rate that would be applied by a market participant. The discount rate may change from year to year as it is based on external market conditions. We performed an impairment analysis as of October 1, 2011 for the Yankee Gas goodwill balance of $287.6 million. We determined that the fair value of Yankee Gas substantially exceeds its carrying value and no impairment exists. In performing the evaluation, we estimated the fair value of the Yankee Gas reporting unit and compared it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimated the fair value of Yankee Gas using a discounted cash flow methodology and two market approaches that analyze comparable companies or transactions. This evaluation requires the input of several critical assumptions, including future growth rates, cash flow projections, operating cost escalation rates, rates of return, a risk-adjusted discount rate, long-term earnings and merger multiples of comparable companies. Income Taxes: Income tax expense is estimated annually for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes. Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences resulting from tax credits, non-tax deductible expenses, in addition to various other items, including items that directly impact our tax return as a result of a regulatory activity (flow-through items). The temporary differences and flow-through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the consolidated balance sheets. The income tax estimation process impacts all of our segments. We record income tax expense quarterly using an estimated annualized effective tax rate. A reconciliation of expected tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate to actual tax expense recorded is included in Note 11, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. We also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets. We follow generally accepted accounting principles to address the methodology to be used in recognizing, measuring and classifying the amounts associated with tax positions that are deemed to be uncertain, including related interest and penalties. The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under this guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us. Once a tax position meets the recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured using a cumulative probability assessment. Assigning probabilities in measuring a recognized tax position and evaluating new information or events in subsequent periods requires significant judgment and could change previous conclusions used to measure the tax position estimate. New information or events may include tax examinations or appeals (including information gained from those examinations), developments in case law, settlements of tax positions, changes in tax law and regulations, rulings by taxing authorities and statute of limitation expirations. Such information or events may have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accounting for Environmental Reserves: Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Adjustments made to estimates of environmental liabilities could have a significant impact on earnings. We estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available options (ranging from no action to full site remediation and long-term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. Our estimates incorporate currently enacted state and federal environmental laws and regulations and data released by the EPA and other organizations. The estimates associated with each possible action plan are judgmental in nature partly because there are usually several different remediation options from which to choose. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in estimates due to certain economic factors. For further information, see Note 12A, Commitments and Contingencies - Environmental Matters, to the consolidated financial statements and Other Matters below. 46 Fair Value Measurements: We follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). We have applied this guidance to the Company's derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value, marketable securities held in NU supplemental benefit trust and WMECO spent nuclear fuel trust, our valuations of investments in our pension and PBOP plans, and nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and AROs. Changes in fair value of the regulated company derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory assets or liabilities, as we expect to recover the costs of these contracts in rates. These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed and assumptions are made. We use quoted market prices when available to determine fair values of financial instruments. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not active and model-derived valuations. When quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy-related product prices for future years for long-dated derivative contracts, future contract quantities under full requirements and supplemental sales contracts, and market volatilities. Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information. Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. For further information, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a sensitivity analysis of how changes in the prices of energy and energy related products would impact earnings. For further information on derivative contracts and marketable securities, see Note 1J, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Derivative Accounting, Note 4, Derivative Instruments, and Note 5, Marketable Securities, to the consolidated financial statements. Other Matters Environmental Matter: HWP continues to investigate the potential need for additional remediation at a river site in Massachusetts containing tar deposits associated with an MGP site that HWP sold to HG&E, a municipal utility, in 1902. As of December 31, 2011, HWP had a $2.4 million reserve for estimated costs that HWP considers probable over the remaining life of the remediation term. Although a material increase to the reserve is not presently anticipated, management cannot reasonably estimate potential additional investigation or remediation costs because these costs would depend, among other things, on the nature, extent and timing of additional investigation and remediation that may be required by the MA DEP. For further information, see Note 12A, Commitments and Contingencies - Environmental Matters, to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted: For information regarding new accounting standards, see Note 1D, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted, to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments: Information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011 is summarized annually through 2016 and thereafter as follows: NU (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Long-term debt maturities (a) $ 329.3 $ 430.0 $ 275.0 $ 150.0 $ 15.4 $ 3,449.6 $ 4,649.3 Estimated interest payments on existing debt (b) 230.8 219.2 207.6 193.5 188.3 1,622.4 2,661.8 Capital leases (c) 3.0 2.6 2.2 2.2 2.0 9.5 21.5 Operating leases (d) 7.7 6.9 4.9 4.3 4.3 16.6 44.7 Funding of pension obligations (d) (h) 197.3 152.2 153.1 148.8 135.3 46.0 832.7 Funding of other postretirement benefit obligations (d) 44.7 28.3 25.5 23.8 21.0 18.6 161.9 Estimated future annual long-term contractual costs (e) 613.5 536.2 567.4 508.1 493.0 4,129.1 6,847.3 Other purchase commitments (d) (g) 1,965.5 - - - - - 1,965.5 Total (f) (i) $ 3,391.8 $ 1,375.4 $ 1,235.7 $ 1,030.7 $ 859.3 $ 9,291.8 $ 17,184.7 47 CL&P (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Long-term debt maturities (a) $ 62.0 $ 125.0 $ 150.0 $ 100.0 $ 15.4 $ 1,891.3 $ 2,343.7 Estimated interest payments on existing debt (b) 126.2 126.2 126.2 116.5 114.0 1,168.3 1,777.4 Capital leases (c) 2.3 2.1 1.9 1.9 1.9 9.4 19.5 Operating leases (d) 3.2 2.8 2.6 2.6 2.6 12.0 25.8 Funding of other postretirement benefit obligations (d) 17.3 9.5 8.6 8.1 7.1 6.3 56.9 Estimated future annual long-term contractual costs (e) 282.6 324.0 362.2 352.1 349.5 2,577.1 4,247.5 Other purchase commitments (d) (g) 744.8 - - - - - 744.8 Total (f) (i) $ 1,238.4 $ 589.6 $ 651.5 $ 581.2 $ 490.5 $ 5,664.4 $ 9,215.6 (a) Long-term debt maturities exclude fees and interest due for spent nuclear fuel disposal costs, unamortized premiums and discounts, and net changes in fair value of hedged debt for NU. (b) Estimated interest payments on fixed-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the coupon rate on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. Estimated interest payments on floating-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the average of the 2011 floating-rate resets on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. This same rate is then assumed for the remaining life of the debt. Interest payments on debt that have an interest rate swap in place are estimated using the effective cost of debt resulting from the swap rather than the underlying interest cost on the debt, subject to the fixed and floating methodologies. (c) The capital lease obligations include imputed interest for NU and CL&P. (d) Amounts are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. (e) Other than the net mark-to-market changes on respective derivative contracts held by both the Regulated companies and NU Enterprises, these obligations are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. (f) Does not include unrecognized tax benefits for NU and CL&P as of December 31, 2011, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the potential amounts of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Also does not include an NU contingent commitment of approximately $45 million to an energy investment fund, which would be invested under certain conditions, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the investment contributions. (g) Amount represents open purchase orders, excluding those obligations that are included in the capital leases, operating leases and estimated future annual long-term contractual costs. These payments are subject to change as certain purchase orders include estimates based on projected quantities of material and/or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. Because payment timing cannot be determined, we include all open purchase order amounts in 2012. (h) These amounts represent NU's estimated minimum pension contributions to its qualified Pension Plan required under ERISA, as amended by the PPA, and the Internal Revenue Code. Contributions in 2013 through 2016 and thereafter will vary depending on many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets, valuation of the plan's liabilities and long-term discount rates, and are subject to change. (i) For NU, excludes other long-term liabilities, including a significant portion of the unrecognized tax benefits described above, deferred contractual obligations, environmental reserves, various injuries and damages reserves ($37.5 million), employee medical insurance reserves ($7.7 million), long-term disability insurance reserves ($11.9 million) and the ARO liability reserves as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the timing of payments. For CL&P, excludes unrecognized tax benefits described above, deferred contractual obligations, environmental reserves, various injuries and damages reserves ($26.1 million), employee medical insurance reserves ($2.4 million), long-term disability insurance reserves ($4 million) and the ARO liability reserves. For further information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see Note 8, Short-Term Debt, Note 9, Long-Term Debt, Note 10A, Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, Note 12B, Commitments and Contingencies - Long-Term Contractual Arrangements, and Note 13, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements. RRB amounts are non-recourse to us, have no required payments over the next five years and are not included in this table. The Regulated companies' standard offer service contracts and default service contracts are also not included in this table.

Our Operating Revenues decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to: Lower electric distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in regulatory commission approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracked electric distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower energy and supply-related costs ($365.3 million), lower CTA revenues and stranded cost recoveries ($175.3 million), lower wholesale revenues ($85.2 million) and lower retail other revenues ($37.9 million), partially offset by higher CL&P FMCC delivery-related revenues ($28.6 million), higher retail transmission revenues ($12.2 million) and higher other tracked revenues ($28.7 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of electric distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $135.5 million due primarily to the rate case decisions that were effective during 2011. Improved transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in transmission infrastructure and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. These were partially offset by a refund to transmission wholesale customers, compared to a recovery from those customers in 2010. The transmission rates provide for an annual reconciliation and recovery or refund of projected costs to actual costs. The difference between projected costs and actual costs are recovered from, or refunded to, customers each year. 49 Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the following: 2011 Decrease (Millions of Dollars) as compared to 2010 Lower GSC supply costs and purchased power costs, partially offset by higher other costs at CL&P $ (323.4) Lower energy prices, a slight increase in ES customer migration to third party suppliers and lower retail sales for PSNH's remaining ES customers (54.3) Lower basic/default service supply costs at WMECO (11.7) Lower natural gas costs at Yankee Gas (15.1) Other (0.4) $ (404.9) Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to: Higher electric distribution expenses ($52.4 million) and higher natural gas expenses ($6.9 million), primarily related to CL&P establishment of a $30 million storm fund reserve to provide bill credits to its residential customers who remained without power after noon on Saturday, November 5, 2011, as a result of the October 2011 snowstorm and to provide contributions to certain Connecticut charitable organizations. In addition, there were higher pension costs and higher general and administrative expenses. Partially offsetting these increases were lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms that have no earnings impact ($11.8 million), such as retail transmission, reliability must run and customer service expenses. In addition, there were lower transmission segment expenses ($8.5 million). Higher NU parent and other companies expenses ($27.3 million) were due primarily to higher costs at NU unregulated electrical contracting business related to an increased level of work in 2011 ($19.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in costs related to NU's pending merger with NSTAR ($2.1 million). Maintenance Maintenance increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the partial amortization in 2011 of the allowed regulatory deferral, which was recorded in maintenance expense in 2010, as a result of the June 30, 2010 CL&P rate case decision ($54.9 million) and higher boiler equipment and maintenance costs at PSNH generation business related to the absence in 2011 of insurance proceeds received in 2010 related to turbine damage, which reduced 2010 costs ($7.4 million). Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher depreciation rates being used at PSNH and WMECO in 2011 as a result of distribution rate case decisions that were effective during 2011 and higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Partially offsetting these increases was a lower depreciation rate being used at CL&P as a result of the distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net, increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to lower CTA transition costs ($197.7 million) partially offset by lower retail CTA revenue ($154.6 million) at CL&P, the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act related to income taxes ($26 million) and increases in ES amortization ($11.4 million) and TCAM amortization ($5.9 million) at PSNH. Partially offsetting these increases was lower amortization related to the previously deferred unrecovered stranded generation costs related to income taxes at CL&P ($38.2 million) and lower amortization of the SBC balance at CL&P ($29.7 million). Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due to the maturity of CL&P RRBs in December 2010 and lower principal balances on the remaining PSNH and WMECO RRBs outstanding. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes in 2011, as compared to 2010, was due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to our capital program and an increase in the tax rate, offset by a decrease in the Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax due primarily to lower transmission segment revenues and lower CTA revenues in 2011, as compared to 2010. 50 Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 231.6 $ 231.1 $ 0.5 0.2 % Interest on RRBs 8.6 20.6 (12.0) (58.3) Other Interest 10.2 (14.4) 24.6 (a) $ 250.4 $ 237.3 $ 13.1 5.5 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown since it is not meaningful. Interest Expense increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher Other Interest in 2011, as compared to 2010, due to the prior year inclusion of a tax-related benefit, partially offset by lower Interest on RRBs in 2011, as compared to 2010, resulting from the maturity of CL&P RRBs in December 2010 and lower principal balances on the remaining PSNH and WMECO RRBs outstanding. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Other Income, Net $ 27.7 $ 41.9 $ (14.2) (33.9) % Other Income, Net decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to net losses on the NU supplemental benefit trust in 2011, compared to net gains in 2010, and the 2011 classification of C&LM and EIA incentives; partially offset by higher AFUDC related to equity funds. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Income Tax Expense $ 171.0 $ 210.4 $ (39.4) (18.7) % Income Tax Expense decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act ($25.2 million), adjustments for prior years taxes including adjustments to reconcile estimated taxes accrued to actual amounts reflected in our filed tax returns ( return to provision adjustments ) ($16.3 million), lower items that directly impact our tax return as a result of regulatory actions ( flow-through items) ($4.6 million) and lower pre-tax earnings ($2.1 million); partially offset by higher state income taxes ($9.6 million). 51 Comparison of 2010 to 2009 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 4,898.2 $ 5,439.4 $ (541.2) (9.9) % Operating Expenses: Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 1,985.6 2,629.6 (644.0) (24.5) Other Operating Expenses 958.4 1,001.2 (42.8) (4.3) Maintenance 210.3 234.2 (23.9) (10.2) Depreciation 300.7 309.6 (8.9) (2.9) Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 95.7 13.3 82.4 (a) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 232.9 217.9 15.0 6.9 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 314.7 282.2 32.5 11.5 Total Operating Expenses 4,098.3 4,688.0 (589.7) (12.6) Operating Income $ 799.9 $ 751.4 $ 48.5 6.5 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful.

Our Operating Revenues decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to: Lower electric distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in regulatory commission approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracked electric distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower GSC and supply-related FMCC charges ($574 million) and lower CL&P delivery-related FMCC ($39 million), partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($66 million) and higher transition cost recoveries ($48 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of electric distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $40 million due primarily to a 1.7 percent increase in retail electric sales volume due to warmer than normal summer weather and PSNH's rate changes that were effective July 1, 2010. A decrease in natural gas revenues was due primarily to lower cost of fuel, as fuel costs are fully recovered in revenues from sales to our customers, offset by an increase in sales volume. Firm natural gas sales increased 1.9 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Improved transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in transmission infrastructure and the return of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. 52 Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the following: 2010 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) as compared to 2009 Lower GSC supply costs and purchased power contract costs, partially offset by an increase in deferred fuel costs at CL&P $ (437.4) Lower prices on purchased natural gas at Yankee Gas (19.7) An increased level of ES customer migration to third party electric suppliers, partially offset by higher retail sales at PSNH (157.4) Lower basic service supply costs at WMECO (34.9) Increase in expenses due primarily to lower unregulated business wholesale contract mark-to-market gains and other loss 5.4 $ (644.0) Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to: Lower distribution and transmission segment expenses of $66 million were due primarily to lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms that have no earnings impact ($65 million), such as retail transmission, reliability must run and customer service expenses, and lower uncollectibles expense at Yankee Gas ($16 million), partially offset by higher electric distribution and natural gas expenses ($22 million and $3 million, respectively), including higher pension costs and storm restoration costs, and higher transmission segment expenses ($4 million). Higher NU parent and other companies expenses of $22 million due primarily to costs incurred in 2010 related to NU's pending merger with NSTAR and higher pension and environmental costs. Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the allowed regulatory deferral of approximately $32 million as a result of the June 30, 2010 CL&P rate case decision, of which $29.5 million was recognized as a deferral in maintenance expense, lower boiler and maintenance costs at PSNH generation business ($12 million), offset by higher distribution segment overhead line expenses ($13 million), higher distribution segment vegetation management costs ($2 million) and higher transmission segment routine station maintenance expenses ($2 million). Depreciation Depreciation decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to a lower depreciation rate being used at CL&P as a result of the distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010, partially offset by higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to a higher recovery of CTA costs at CL&P ($39 million), higher PSNH amortization on the ES deferral and TCAM ($42 million and $11 million, respectively), and previously deferred unrecovered stranded generation costs at WMECO ($11 million), partially offset by the impact of the 2010 Healthcare Act related to the deferral of lost tax benefits that we believe are probable of recovery in future electric and natural gas distribution rates ($26 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2010 Increase (Millions of Dollars) as compared to 2009 Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax $ 8.9 Property Taxes 12.5 Use Taxes 10.4 Other 0.7 $ 32.5 The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes was due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to our capital programs. The Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax increased primarily as a result of an increase in the transmission segment revenues and an increase in distribution segment revenues primarily related to retail transmission and higher transition cost recoveries in 2010, as compared to 2009. The increase in use taxes was due primarily to the absence in 2010 of a Connecticut state use tax refund. 53 Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 231.1 $ 224.7 $ 6.4 2.8 % Interest on RRBs 20.6 36.5 (15.9) (43.6) Other Interest (14.4) 12.4 (26.8) (a) $ 237.3 $ 273.6 $ (36.3) (13.3) % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Interest Expense decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the settlement of various state tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2010, which resulted in a reduction in Other Interest and lower Interest on RRBs resulting from lower principal balances outstanding, offset by higher Interest on Long-Term Debt as a result of $145 million in new long-term debt issuances in the first half of 2010 and $400 million in 2009, $150 million of which was issued by PSNH in December 2009. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase Percent Other Income, Net $ 41.9 $ 37.8 $ 4.1 10.8 % Other Income, Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher AFUDC related to equity funds ($7 million), higher C&LM and EIA incentives ($3 million and $2 million, respectively), offset with lower investment and interest income ($4 million and $2 million, respectively). Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 210.4 $ 179.9 $ 30.5 17.0 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the impact of the 2010 Healthcare Act ($30 million) and higher pre-tax earnings ($10 million), partially offset by lower impacts related to flow-through items and other impacts ($5 million) and adjustments for prior years' taxes including return to provision adjustments ($5 million). 54 Selected Consolidated Sales Statistics 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Revenues: (Thousands) Regulated Companies: Residential $ 2,091,270 $ 2,336,078 $ 2,569,278 $ 2,525,635 $ 2,558,547 Commercial 1,201,091 1,303,841 1,462,786 1,607,224 1,735,923 Industrial 252,878 268,598 297,854 399,753 412,381 Wholesale 350,413 506,475 445,261 545,127 392,675 Streetlighting and Railroads 35,283 42,387 33,035 38,522 45,880 Miscellaneous and Eliminations 47,485 (29,878) 128,118 24,673 84,043 Total Electric 3,978,420 4,427,501 4,936,332 5,140,934 5,229,449 Natural Gas 430,799 434,277 449,571 577,390 514,185 Total - Regulated Companies 4,409,219 4,861,778 5,385,903 5,718,324 5,743,634 Other and Eliminations 56,438 36,389 53,527 81,771 78,592 Total $ 4,465,657 $ 4,898,167 $ 5,439,430 $ 5,800,095 $ 5,822,226 Regulated Companies - Sales: (GWh) Residential 14,766 14,913 14,412 14,509 15,051 Commercial 14,301 14,506 14,474 14,885 15,103 Industrial 4,418 4,481 4,423 5,149 5,635 Wholesale 1,020 3,423 4,183 3,576 3,855 Streetlighting and Railroads 327 330 336 340 353 Total 34,832 37,653 37,828 38,459 39,997 Regulated Companies - Customers: (Average) Residential 1,710,342 1,704,197 1,696,756 1,700,207 1,697,073 Commercial 193,505 192,266 189,265 190,067 189,727 Industrial 7,083 7,150 7,207 7,342 7,291 Streetlighting, Railroads and Wholesale* 5,735 6,292 7,548 4,605 3,855 Total Electric 1,916,665 1,909,905 1,900,776 1,902,221 1,897,946 Natural Gas 207,753 205,885 206,438 204,834 202,743 Total 2,124,418 2,115,790 2,107,214 2,107,055 2,100,689 *Customer counts were redefined with the implementation of a new customer service system (C2) completed in October 2008. 55 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for CL&P included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Comparison of 2011 to 2010 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 2,548.4 $ 2,999.1 $ (450.7) (15.0) % Operating Expenses: Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 929.9 1,253.3 (323.4) (25.8) Other Operating Expenses 570.5 524.3 46.2 8.8 Maintenance 149.0 96.5 52.5 54.4 Depreciation 157.7 172.2 (14.5) (8.4) Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 65.2 83.9 (18.7) (22.3) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds - 167.0 (167.0) (100.0) Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 212.9 214.2 (1.3) (0.6) Total Operating Expenses 2,085.2 2,511.4 (426.2) (17.0) Operating Income $ 463.2 $ 487.7 $ (24.5) (5.0) % Operating Revenues CL&P's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Retail Sales in GWh 22,315 22,666 (351) (1.5) % CL&P's Operating Revenues decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to: A $545.4 million decrease in distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in PURA approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. The tracked distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower GSC and FMCC supply-related revenues ($316.4 million), lower CTA revenues ($165.5 million), lower wholesale revenues ($81.7 million) and lower retail other revenues ($38.4 million). The lower GSC and FMCC supply-related revenues were due primarily to lower customer rates resulting from lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2011, as compared to 2010. These lower revenues were partially offset by higher FMCC delivery-related revenues ($28.6 million) and higher retail transmission revenues ($14 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $110.4 million in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the retail rate increase effective January 1, 2011. A $15.7 million decrease in transmission segment revenues was due primarily to a refund to transmission wholesale customers, compared to a recovery from those customers in 2010. The transmission rates provide for an annual reconciliation and recovery or refund of projected costs to actual costs. The difference between projected costs and actual costs are recovered from, or refunded to, customers each year. This decrease was partially offset by increased transmission segment revenues due to a higher level of investment in the transmission infrastructure. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the following: 2011 Increase/(Decrease) (Millions of Dollars) as compared to 2010 GSC Supply Costs $ (325.8) Deferred Fuel Costs 10.5 Other Purchased Power Costs (60.4) Other 52.3 $ (323.4) The decrease in GSC supply costs was due primarily to lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2011, as compared to 2010. These GSC supply costs are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to various suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply SS and LRS load through a competitive solicitation process. These costs are included in PURA approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, as a result of higher distribution segment expenses ($60.4 million) mainly as a result of the establishment of a $30 million storm fund reserve to provide bill credits to its residential customers who 56 remained without power after noon on Saturday, November 5, 2011, as a result of the October 2011 snowstorm and to provide contributions to certain Connecticut charitable organizations. In addition, there were higher administrative and general expenses, including higher pension costs. Partially offsetting these increases were lower transmission segment expenses ($7.4 million) and lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($4.3 million). Maintenance Maintenance increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the partial amortization in 2011 of the allowed regulatory deferral, which was recorded in maintenance expense in 2010, as a result of the June 30, 2010 rate case decision ($54.9 million). Depreciation Depreciation decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to a lower depreciation rate being used as a result of the 2010 distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010, partially offset by higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net, decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to lower amortization related to the previously deferred unrecovered stranded generation costs related to income taxes ($38.2 million) and lower amortization of the SBC balance ($29.7 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were lower CTA transition costs ($197.6 million), partially offset by lower retail CTA revenue ($154.6 million), and the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act related to income taxes ($12 million). Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due to the maturity of RRBs in December 2010. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The decrease in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes in 2011, as compared to 2010, was due primarily to a decrease in the Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax due primarily to lower transmission segment revenues and lower CTA revenues in 2011, as compared to 2010, partially offset by an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to CL&P capital program and an increase in the tax rate. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 131.9 $ 134.6 $ (2.7) (2.0) % Interest on RRBs - 7.5 (7.5) (100.0) Other Interest 0.8 (4.4) 5.2 (a) $ 132.7 $ 137.7 $ (5.0) (3.6) % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown since it is not meaningful. Interest Expense decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the absence of Interest on RRBs in 2011, as CL&P's RRBs matured in December 2010, and lower Interest on Long-Term Debt in 2011 related to lower interest rates on the refinancing of the PCRBs. Partially offsetting these decreases was higher Other Interest in 2011, as compared to 2010, due to the prior year inclusion of a tax-related benefit. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Other Income, Net $ 9.7 $ 26.7 $ (17.0) (63.7) % Other Income, Net decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to net losses on the NU supplemental benefit trust in 2011, compared to net gains in 2010, as well as the 2011 classification of C&LM and EIA incentives. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Income Tax Expense $ 90.0 $ 132.4 $ (42.4) (32.0) % Income Tax Expense decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act ($13.2 million), adjustments for prior years taxes including return to provision ($16.7 million), a decrease in pre-tax earnings ($7.3 million) and lower flow-through and other impacts ($5.2 million). 57 Comparison of 2010 to 2009 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 2,999.1 $ 3,424.5 $ (425.4) (12.4) % Operating Expenses: Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 1,253.3 1,690.7 (437.4) (25.9) Other Operating Expenses 524.3 571.0 (46.7) (8.2) Maintenance 96.5 117.8 (21.3) (18.1) Depreciation 172.2 186.9 (14.7) (7.9) Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 83.9 45.8 38.1 83.2 Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 167.0 156.0 11.0 7.1 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 214.2 191.2 23.0 12.0 Total Operating Expenses 2,511.4 2,959.4 (448.0) (15.1) Operating Income $ 487.7 $ 465.1 $ 22.6 4.9 % Operating Revenues CL&P's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase Percent Retail Sales in GWh 22,666 22,266 400 1.8 % CL&P's Operating Revenues decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to: Lower distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in PURA approved tracking mechanisms that track and recover certain incurred costs that do not impact earnings. The tracked distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower GSC and supply-related FMCC revenues ($421 million) and lower delivery-related FMCC revenues ($39 million). The lower GSC and supply-related FMCC revenues were due primarily to lower customer rates resulting from lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2010, as compared to 2009. The lower delivery-related FMCC revenues were due primarily to changes in projections for certain delivery-related FMCC costs for 2010 that lowered the average rate charged to customers. These lower revenues were partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($37 million), higher transition cost recoveries ($27 million) and higher wholesale revenues ($4 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings decreased $3 million due primarily to an unfavorable variance in demand and customer service charge components offset by a 1.8 percent increase in retail sales in 2010, as compared to 2009. Improved transmission segment revenues ($29 million) resulting from a higher level of investment in this segment and the return of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the following: 2010 Decrease (Millions of Dollars) as compared to 2009 GSC Supply Costs $ (385.7) Deferred Fuel Costs (26.0) Other Purchased Power Costs (25.7) $ (437.4) The decrease in GSC supply costs was due primarily to lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2010, as compared to 2009. These GSC supply costs are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to various suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply SS and LRS load through a competitive solicitation process. The decrease in deferred fuel costs was due primarily to a smaller net overrecovery in 2010, as compared to 2009. These costs are included in PURA approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, as a result of lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($69 million) including reliability must run ($32 million) and retail transmission ($31 million), partially offset by higher distribution segment expenses ($20 million) mainly as a result of higher administrative and general expenses, including higher pension costs, and higher transmission segment expenses ($3 million). 58 Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily related to the allowed regulatory deferral of approximately $32 million as a result of the June 30, 2010 rate case decision, of which $29.5 million was recognized as a deferral in maintenance expense. Partially offsetting this decrease was higher distribution overhead line expenses ($3 million) and higher distribution segment vegetation management costs ($3 million). Depreciation Depreciation decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to a lower depreciation rate being used as a result of the distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net, increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher retail CTA revenue ($22 million) and lower CTA transition costs ($17 million). Partially offsetting these increases was a deferral of lost tax benefits related to the 2010 Healthcare Act that we believe are probable of recovery in future distribution rates ($15 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2010 Increase (Millions of Dollars) as compared to 2009 Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax $ 9.8 Property Taxes 7.0 Use Taxes 5.9 Other 0.3 $ 23.0 The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes was due primarily to an increase in the Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax as a result of the increase in the transmission segment revenues and an increase in distribution segment revenues primarily related to retail transmission and higher transition cost recoveries in 2010, as compared to 2009. The increase in property taxes was a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to CL&P's capital programs. The increase in use taxes was due to the absence in 2010 of a Connecticut state use tax refund. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 134.6 $ 133.4 $ 1.2 0.9 % Interest on RRBs 7.5 19.1 (11.6) (60.7) Other Interest (4.4) 3.3 (7.7) (a) $ 137.7 $ 155.8 $ (18.1) (11.6) % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Interest Expense decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to lower Interest on RRBs resulting from lower principal balances outstanding and the settlement of various tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2010, which resulted in a reduction in Other Interest. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase Percent Other Income, Net $ 26.7 $ 25.9 $ 0.8 3.1 % Other Income, Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher C&LM and EIA incentives ($3 million and $3 million, respectively), offset with lower investment and interest income ($3 million) and lower AFUDC related to equity funds ($1 million). Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 132.4 $ 118.8 $ 13.6 11.4 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the impact of the 2010 Healthcare Act ($15 million) and higher pre-tax earnings ($5 million), partially offset by lower impacts related to flow-through items ($4 million) and adjustments to reconcile estimated taxes accrued to actual amounts reflected in our filed tax returns ($2 million). 59 LIQUIDITY CL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2011 of $513.3 million, compared with operating cash flows of $501.7 million in 2010 (2010 amount is net of RRB payments, which is included in financing activities). The improved cash flows in 2011 were due primarily to the impact of the DPUC (now PURA) July 1, 2010 distribution rate case decision, which increased CL&P customer rates effective January 1, 2011, income tax refunds in 2011 of $27.5 million largely attributable to accelerated depreciation tax benefits, compared to income tax payments of $71.5 million in 2010. Offsetting these benefits was approximately $132 million of cash disbursements associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October snowstorm. CL&P had cash flows from operating activities in 2010 of $501.7 million, compared with operating cash flows of $482.2 million in 2009 (all amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). Improved cash flows in 2010 were attributed to a decrease in payments made related to CL&P's accounts payable in support of its operating activities. Improved cash flows were further due to increases in amortization on regulatory deferrals primarily attributable to 2009 activity within CL&P CTA tracking mechanism where such costs exceeded revenues resulting in an unfavorable cash flow impact in 2009. Offsetting the improved cash flows was an increase in income tax payments of $29.1 million, which was the result of accelerated depreciation tax benefits received throughout 2009 not being extended for the full year of 2010 until the fourth quarter of 2010. CL&P 2012 cash flows provided by operating activities are expected to be lower than in 2011 due primarily to approximately $27 million in bill credits provided to CL&P residential customers in February 2012. In 2012, cash payments for Tropical Storm Irene and the October storm costs are estimated to be approximately $140 million, as compared to 2011 payments of approximately $132 million. On April 1, 2011, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt secured PCRBs that were subject to mandatory tender. The PCRBs, which mature on May 1, 2031, carry a coupon rate of 1.25 percent and have a mandatory tender on April 1, 2012, at which time CL&P expects to remarket the bonds. On October 24, 2011, CL&P issued $120.5 million of PCRBs carrying a coupon of 4.375 percent that will mature on September 1, 2028, and $125 million of PCRBs carrying a coupon of 1.25 percent that mature on September 1, 2028 and are subject to mandatory tender on September 3, 2013. The proceeds of these issuances were used to refund $245.5 million of PCRBs that carried a coupon of 5.85 percent and had a maturity date of September 1, 2028. The refinancing is expected to reduce interest costs by approximately $7.5 million in 2012. Cash capital expenditures included on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, the AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income. CL&P's cash capital expenditures totaled $424.9 million in 2011, compared with $380.3 million in 2010. Investing activities in 2011 included Proceeds from Sale of Assets of $46.8 million included on the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows related to the sale of certain CL&P transmission assets. Financing activities in 2011 included $243.2 million in common dividends paid to NU parent, $31 million in short-term borrowings and $52.3 million in borrowings from the NU Money Pool. 60 Selected Consolidated Sales Statistics 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Revenues: (Thousands) Residential $ 1,345,290 $ 1,597,754 $ 1,840,750 $ 1,811,845 $ 1,854,404 Commercial 732,968 821,872 935,586 1,042,077 1,182,196 Industrial 126,783 144,463 151,839 190,723 208,087 Wholesale 278,751 441,660 386,034 484,843 347,514 Streetlighting and Railroads 25,177 32,084 22,638 28,710 35,370 Miscellaneous 39,418 (38,731) 87,691 163 54,246 Total $ 2,548,387 $ 2,999,102 $ 3,424,538 $ 3,558,361 $ 3,681,817 Sales: (GWh) Residential 10,093 10,196 9,848 9,913 10,336 Commercial 9,525 9,716 9,705 9,993 10,128 Industrial 2,414 2,467 2,427 2,945 3,264 Wholesale 1,591 3,040 3,434 3,637 3,563 Streetlighting and Railroads 284 286 286 294 304 Total 23,907 25,705 25,700 26,782 27,595 Customers: (Average) Residential 1,100,740 1,096,576 1,093,229 1,094,991 1,091,799 Commercial 103,975 103,166 101,814 102,464 102,411 Industrial 3,331 3,359 3,381 3,613 3,743 Streetlighting, Railroads and Wholesale* 4,260 4,366 5,307 2,883 2,583 Total 1,212,306 1,207,467 1,203,731 1,203,951 1,200,536 *Customers counts were redefined with the implementation of a new customer service system (C2) completed in October 2008. 61 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for PSNH included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Comparison of 2011 to 2010: Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/ (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 1,013.0 $ 1,033.4 $ (20.4) (2.0) % Operating Expenses: Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 308.8 363.1 (54.3) (15.0) Other Operating Expenses 217.1 230.2 (13.1) (5.7) Maintenance 93.1 82.4 10.7 13.0 Depreciation 76.1 67.2 8.9 13.2 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 25.4 11.2 14.2 (a) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 53.4 50.4 3.0 6.0 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 59.0 52.7 6.3 12.0 Total Operating Expenses 832.9 857.2 (24.3) (2.8) Operating Income $ 180.1 $ 176.2 $ 3.9 2.2 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Operating Revenues PSNH's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Retail Sales in GWh 7,815 7,847 (32) (0.4) % PSNH's Operating Revenues decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to: A $46.4 million decrease in distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in NHPUC approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs and do not impact earnings. This decrease primarily related to lower purchased fuel and power costs ($33.7 million), mostly related to lower energy prices and a slight increase in ES customer migration to third party electric suppliers. In addition, there were lower stranded cost recoveries ($5.3 million) and lower retail transmission revenues ($2.8 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers and undercollections to be recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $19.1 million in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the retail rate increase effective July 1, 2010. A $6.9 million improvement in transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in this segment and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to lower energy prices and a slight increase in ES customer migration to third party electric suppliers and lower retail sales for PSNH's remaining ES customers. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, as a result of lower retail transmission expenses ($8.7 million) and lower general and administrative costs ($3.9 million). Maintenance Maintenance increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher boiler equipment and maintenance costs at the generation business related to the absence in 2011 of insurance proceeds received in 2010 related to turbine damage, which reduced 2010 costs ($7.4 million) and higher distribution segment routine overhead line expenses ($5.7 million) primarily related to storm costs that did not meet the minimum requirement for regulatory deferral, offset by lower distribution segment vegetation management costs ($1.9 million). Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to a higher depreciation rate being used as a result of the distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010 and higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service related to PSNH's capital programs. 62 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to increases in ES amortization ($11.4 million), the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act related to income taxes ($6.7 million) and TCAM amortization ($5.9 million), partially offset by a decrease in SCRC amortization ($7.4 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes in 2011, as compared to 2010, was due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to PSNH capital program and an increase in the tax rate .

Of this decrease, $121 million related to lower recovery of purchased fuel and power costs mostly related to ES customer migration to third party electric suppliers, $19 million in lower transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation and $11 million related to lower wholesale revenues, offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($25 million) and an increase in the SCRC ($12 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers and undercollections to be recovered from customers in future periods. A $40 million increase in distribution segment revenues that impacts earnings primarily as a result of the retail rate increase effective July 1, 2010 and higher sales volume. Retail sales increased 1.3 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. A $9 million improvement in transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in this segment and the return of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to an increased level of ES customer migration to third party electric suppliers, partially offset by higher retail sales. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to lower distribution segment expenses ($7 million), mainly as a result of the rate case decision changing the collection of certain expenses to be tracked through the TCAM included in Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net in 2010. Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to lower boiler equipment and maintenance costs at the generation business ($12 million) as a result of insurance proceeds received in 2010 related to turbine damage, offset by higher distribution overhead line expenses related to storms in 2010 ($8 million). Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service related to PSNH capital programs. Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to increases in ES deferral ($42 million) and TCAM ($11 million) offset by decreases in the impact of the 2010 Healthcare Act related to the deferral of lost tax benefits that we believe are probable of recovery in future distribution rates ($7 million) and the Northern Wood Power Project accrual ($5 million) . 64 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2010 Increase (Millions of Dollars) as compared to 2009 Property Taxes $ 3.1 Use Taxes 1.5 Other 0.2 $ 4.8 The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes was due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to PSNH's capital programs.

LIQUIDITY PSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2011 of $151.8 million, compared with operating cash flows of $145.4 million in 2010 and $58.2 million in 2009 (amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The improved cash flows were due primarily to income tax refunds in 2011 of $29.3 million largely attributable to accelerated depreciation tax benefits, compared to income tax payments of $1.6 million in 2010, and the impact of PSNH 2010 distribution rate case settlement, which increased PSNH rates effective July 1, 2010. Offsetting these benefits was a contribution into the NU Pension Plan of $112.6 million in 2011, compared with a contribution into the NU Pension Plan of $45 million in 2010. 65 Selected Consolidated Sales Statistics 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Revenues: (Thousands) Residential $ 532,813 $ 529,992 $ 506,725 $ 472,486 $ 457,616 Commercial 340,597 360,373 407,743 431,461 413,196 Industrial 85,845 90,243 112,460 169,785 156,258 Wholesale 27,198 33,003 41,193 35,935 25,030 Streetlighting 6,218 6,669 6,331 6,515 6,018 Miscellaneous 20,332 13,159 35,139 25,020 24,954 Total $ 1,013,003 $ 1,033,439 $ 1,109,591 $ 1,141,202 $ 1,083,072 Sales: (GWh) Residential 3,141 3,175 3,097 3,105 3,176 Commercial 3,315 3,309 3,311 3,361 3,403 Industrial 1,336 1,339 1,318 1,435 1,528 Wholesale (703) 206 562 (243) 105 Streetlighting 23 24 24 25 24 Total 7,112 8,053 8,312 7,683 8,236 Customers: (Average) Residential 422,072 420,481 417,670 418,107 417,420 Commercial 72,021 71,746 70,984 70,807 70,341 Industrial 3,049 3,088 3,134 2,978 2,770 Streetlighting and Wholesale* 1,074 1,442 1,438 970 602 Total 498,216 496,757 493,226 492,862 491,133 *Customers counts were redefined with the implementation of a new customer service system (C2) completed in October 2008. 66 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for WMECO included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Comparison of 2011 to 2010 : Operating Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 Increase/ Percent (Decrease) Operating Revenues $ 417.3 $ 395.2 $ 22.1 5.6 % Operating Expenses: Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 145.6 157.3 (11.7) (7.4) Other Operating Expenses 98.3 102.1 (3.8) (3.7) Maintenance 17.7 19.2 (1.5) (7.8) Depreciation 26.5 23.6 2.9 12.3 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 6.4 2.3 4.1 (a) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 16.5 15.5 1.0 6.5 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 17.9 16.5 1.4 8.5 Total Operating Expenses 328.9 336.5 (7.6) (2.3) Operating Income $ 88.4 $ 58.7 $ 29.7 50.6 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Operating Revenues WMECO's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Decrease Percent Retail Sales in GWh 3,695 3,732 (37) (1.0) % WMECO's Operating Revenues increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to: An $18.6 million improvement in transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in this segment and the recovery of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. The portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $6.1 million due primarily to the retail rate increase effective February 1, 2011 ($11.1 million), partially offset by the establishment of a reserve related to a wholesale billing adjustment made in the third quarter of 2011 ($5 million). Amounts related to distribution revenues that did not impact earnings and are included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs decreased by $2.5 million in 2011, compared to 2010. Included in these amounts are pension, C&LM collections and other trackers. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections to be recovered from customers in future periods. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to lower basic service supply costs in addition to an increase in the deferral of excess basic service expense over basic service revenue. The basic service supply costs are the contractual amounts WMECO must pay to various suppliers that serve this load after winning a competitive solicitation process. To the extent these costs do not match revenues collected from customers, the DPU allows the difference to be deferred for future recovery from or refund to customers. The basic service supply costs decreased due primarily to lower supplier contract rates, partially offset by increased load volumes. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, as a result of a decrease in bad debt expense ($7.2 million) and lower retail transmission expenses ($2.4 million), offset by a reduction in the amount of deferred C&LM costs ($3.1 million) and an increase in administrative and general expenses ($0.8 million), primarily related to higher pension costs. All these costs are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact. Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to lower distribution segment routine overhead line expenses ($2.5 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment routine overhead line expenses ($0.8 million). 67 Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to a higher depreciation rate being used at WMECO as a result of the distribution rate case decision that was effective February 1, 2011 and higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service related to WMECO's capital programs. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net, increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to the absence in 2011 of the impact from the 2010 Healthcare Act related to income taxes ($4 million), the amortization of the 2008 through 2010 major storm costs ($3.1 million) and the amortization related to the recovery of certain hardship customer receivables ($1 million). The recovery of the storm costs and hardship customer receivables were approved by the DPU as result of WMECO's rate case decision effective February 1, 2011. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in transition charge amortization ($3.5 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes in 2011, as compared to 2010, was due primarily to an increase in property taxes related to an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to WMECO capital program and an increase in the tax rate .

Interest Expense increased in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher Interest on Long-Term Debt resulting from the $100 million debt issuance in September 2011, offset by lower Interest on RRBs resulting from lower principal balances outstanding.

Operating Revenues WMECO's retail sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase Percent Retail Sales in GWh 3,732 3,644 88 2.4 % WMECO's Operating Revenues decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to: A $20 million decrease related to distribution revenues that did not impact earnings and was included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through WMECO's tariffs. Included in these amounts are a decrease of $31 million related to a lower recovery of energy supply costs and a decrease of $7 million related to transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation. Offsetting these decreases were increases in transition cost recoveries, C&LM collections and retail transmission revenues ($8 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections to be recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $2 million due primarily to a 2.4 percent increase in retail sales in 2010, as compared to 2009. A $10 million improvement in transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in this segment and the return of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to lower basic service supply costs. The basic service supply costs are the contractual amounts WMECO must pay to various suppliers that serve this load after winning a competitive solicitation process. These costs decreased due primarily to lower supplier contract rates. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, as a result of higher distribution segment expenses ($9 million) resulting from higher administrative and general expenses, including pension costs, higher costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact primarily related to an increase in C&LM expenses attributable to the Massachusetts Green Communities Act ($6 million), and higher transmission segment expenses ($1 million). Maintenance Maintenance increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher distribution overhead line expenses. Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service related to WMECO's capital programs. Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the recovery of the previously deferred unrecovered stranded generation costs ($11 million), offset by a deferral of lost tax benefits related to the 2010 Healthcare Act that we believe are probable of recovery in future distribution rates ($4 million). 69 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 2010 Increase (Millions of Dollars) as compared to 2009 Property Taxes $ 1.5 Use Taxes 0.6 Other 0.3 $ 2.4 The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes was due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to WMECO's capital programs.

Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase Percent Income Tax Expense $ 16.3 $ 14.9 $ 1.4 9.4 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the impact of the 2010 Healthcare Act ($3 million), partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings and other impacts ($2 million). LIQUIDITY WMECO had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2011 of $108 million, compared with operating cash flows of $50.5 million in 2010 and $47.7 million in 2009 (amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The improved cash flows were due primarily to the impact of the DPU distribution rate case decision that was effective February 1, 2011, income tax refunds in 2011 of $4.9 million largely attributable to accelerated depreciation tax benefits, compared to income tax payments of $5 million in 2010 and a net positive cash flow impact associated with transmission overrecoveries in 2011, as compared to 2010. Offsetting these benefits was approximately $15 million of cash disbursements associated with Tropical Storm Irene and the October snowstorm. 70 Selected Consolidated Sales Statistics 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Revenues: (Thousands) Residential $ 213,167 $ 208,332 $ 221,803 $ 241,303 $ 246,526 Commercial 127,526 121,597 119,457 133,686 140,531 Industrial 40,250 33,892 33,555 39,245 48,036 Wholesale 44,464 31,812 18,034 24,349 20,131 Streetlighting 3,888 3,633 4,066 3,297 4,492 Miscellaneous (11,980) (4,105) 5,498 (353) 5,029 Total $ 417,315 $ 395,161 $ 402,413 $ 441,527 $ 464,745 Sales: (GWh) Residential 1,533 1,542 1,467 1,491 1,539 Commercial 1,474 1,496 1,474 1,547 1,589 Industrial 669 675 679 769 842 Wholesale 131 177 187 179 178 Streetlighting 19 20 24 22 25 Total 3,826 3,910 3,831 4,008 4,173 Customers: (Average) Residential 187,529 187,140 185,856 187,109 187,854 Commercial 17,630 17,475 16,587 16,916 17,096 Industrial 702 703 692 751 777 Streetlighting and Wholesale 434 516 835 785 703 Total 206,295 205,834 203,970 205,561 206,430 71
