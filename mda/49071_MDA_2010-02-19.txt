ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana is one of the nation largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies, based on our 2009 revenues of approximately $31.0 billion. We are a full-service benefits solutions company, offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit products for employer groups, government benefit programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 10.3 million members in our medical benefit plans, as well as approximately 7.2 million members in our specialty products. We manage our business with two segments: Government and Commercial. The Government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare, Military, and Medicaid. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals. When identifying our segments, we aggregated products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing, benefits, and underwriting requirements. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other revenue, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks, in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Our results are impacted by many factors, but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium, ASO fee, and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs. Benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces, including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures, new prescription drugs and therapies, an aging population, lifestyle challenges including diet and smoking, the tort liability system, and government regulation. Our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The selling, general, and administrative expense ratio, or SG&A expense ratio, which is computed by taking total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, administrative services fees and other revenues, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency. Proposed Health Insurance Initiatives The President of the United States and members of the U.S. Congress have proposed significant reforms to the U.S. health care system. In November 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act and in December 2009 the U.S. Senate passed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which we refer to collectively as the Acts . While there are significant differences between the two Acts, they include, for example, limiting Medicare Advantage payment rates, mandatory issuance of insurance coverage, requirements that would limit the ability of health plans and insurers to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk, stipulating annual rebates to enrollees if the amount of premium revenues expended on medical costs falls below prescribed ratios for group and individual health insurance coverage, and imposing new non-deductible taxes on health insurers increasing in the aggregate from $2 billion to $10 billion annually over ten years. In addition, certain members of Congress have proposed a single-payer health care system, a government health insurance option to compete with private plans, and other expanded public health care measures. Various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level. Because of the 34 Table of Contents unsettled nature of these initiatives and the numerous steps required to implement them, we cannot predict what health insurance initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on our business. However, legislative changes, if enacted, may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, including lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the non-deductible excise tax, financial position, including goodwill recoverability, and cash flows. Government Segment Our strategy and commitment to the Medicare programs has led to significant growth. Medicare Advantage membership increased to 1,508,500 members at December 31, 2009, up 72,600 members, or 5.1% from 1,435,900 members at December 31, 2008, primarily due to sales of preferred provider organization, or PPO products. Average Medicare Advantage membership increased 11.5% in 2009 compared to 2008, including the impact from the 2008 acquisitions of Cariten, Metcare, OSF, and SecureHorizons, discussed below. Likewise, Medicare Advantage premium revenues have increased 19.1% to $16.4 billion for 2009 from $13.8 billion for 2008. Recently the mix of sales has shifted increasingly to our network-based PPO offerings, which is particularly important given the enactment of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, or the Act, discussed more fully below. Medicare Advantage members enrolled in network-based products was approximately 63% at December 31, 2009 compared to 51% at December 31, 2008, with our PPO membership increasing 94.6% from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. Medicare Advantage members enrolled in network-based products increased to approximately 71% in January 2010. We expect Medicare Advantage membership to increase by 240,000 to 260,000 members, or approximately 16% to 17%, in 2010. Due to the enactment of the Act in July 2008, beginning in 2011, sponsors of Medicare Advantage Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. We have 564,200 PFFS members, or approximately 37% of our total Medicare Advantage membership at December 31, 2009, down from 49% at December 31, 2008. Approximately 87% of our PFFS members at December 31, 2009 resided in geographies where we have developed a provider network and offer a networked plan. We are continuing to implement various operational and strategic initiatives, including further developing our networks and building network-based plan offerings to address the adequate network requirement. We anticipate these initiatives, together with certain counties exemption from the network requirement, to result in more than 95% of our PFFS members having the choice of remaining in a Humana plan in 2011. Final 2010 Medicare Advantage rates were announced by CMS on April 6, 2009, with an effective rate decrease for the industry of 4% to 5%. Based on information available at the time we filed our 2010 bids in June 2009, we believe we have effectively designed Medicare Advantage products that address the lower rates while continuing to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original Medicare with a supplement policy as well as other Medicare Advantage competitors within our industry. In addition, we will continue to pursue our cost-reduction and outcome-enhancing strategies, including care coordination and disease management, to mitigate the adverse effects of this rate reduction on our Medicare Advantage members. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute operational and strategic initiatives with respect to changes in the Medicare Advantage program. Failure to execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We also offer Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under the Medicare Part D program. These plans provide varying degrees of coverage. In order to offer these plans in a given year, in June of the preceding year we must submit bids to CMS for approval. During 2008, we experienced prescription drug claim expenses for our Medicare stand-alone PDPs that were higher than we had originally assumed in the bid that we submitted to CMS in June 2007. These higher claim levels for our Medicare stand-alone PDPs reflected a combination of several variances between our actuarial bid assumptions versus our experience. These variances resulted from, among other things, differences between the actuarial utilization assumptions (which are our attempts to predict members future utilization of drugs) in the bids for one of our plans versus our actual claims 35 Table of Contents experience in 2008, as well as an increase in the percentage of higher cost members. These issues were addressed for 2009 based on enhancements made to our bid development and review processes. Our Medicare stand-alone PDP membership declined to 1,927,900 members at December 31, 2009, down 1,138,700 members, or 37.1%, from December 31, 2008, resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience. These actions also resulted in a substantial decline in our stand-alone PDP benefit ratio for 2009 compared to 2008. We expect Medicare stand-alone PDP membership to decrease by 50,000 to 100,000 members, or approximately 3% to 5%, in 2010 as we continue to price and design benefits to correspond with our historical experience. Our quarterly Government segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member plan period which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the Government segment benefit ratio generally improves as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low-income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone PDP products affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern. Our military services business primarily consists of the TRICARE South Region contract which covers benefits for healthcare services provided to beneficiaries through March 31, 2010. On December 16, 2009, we were notified by Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, or TMA, that it intends to exercise its options to extend the TRICARE South Region contract for Option Period VII and Option Period VIII. The exercise of these option periods would effectively extend the TRICARE South Region contract through March 31, 2011. In July 2009, we were notified by the Department of Defense that we were not awarded the third generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region which had been subject to competing bids. We filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the DoD and those that appear to have been used by the DoD in making its contractor selection. In October 2009, we learned that the GAO had upheld our protest, determining that the TMA evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the South Region. On December 22, 2009, we were advised that TMA notified the GAO of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the GAO decision with respect to our protest. At this time, we are not able to determine what actions TMA will take in response to recommendations by the GAO, nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the GAO will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award. For 2009, premiums and ASO fees associated with the TRICARE South Region contract were $3.4 billion, or 11.2% of our total premiums and ASO fees. We are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill, which had a carrying value of $49.8 million at December 31, 2009, potential exit costs, possible asset sales, and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses. Goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2009. Commercial Segment Commercial segment pretax earnings, impacted by the economic recession and the highly competitive environment partially offset by higher investment income, decreased by $103.5 million, or 49.8%, for 2009 compared to 2008. Commercial segment medical membership at December 31, 2009 of 3,410,800 decreased 210,000 members, or 5.8% from December 31, 2008. The decline in membership primarily was a result of the impact of the economic recession, including the loss of two larger ASO accounts. The economic recession has led to increased in-group member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels primarily through reductions of less experienced workers. As a result, we experienced higher utilization of benefits, mainly in our fully-insured group accounts, primarily due to the shift in the mix of members to an older workforce having more health care needs, as well as members utilizing more benefits ahead of actual or perceived layoffs, members 36 Table of Contents seeking to maximize their benefits once their deductibles are met, and increased COBRA participation. The membership declines were partially offset by enrollment gains in our individual product, a strategic area of commercial growth. Individual membership at December 31, 2009 increased 13.0% from December 31, 2008. This increase in individual membership, together with administrative costs associated with increased business for our mail-order pharmacy, led to a higher Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio. We expect Commercial segment medical membership to decline by 160,000 to 180,000 members in 2010. Financial Position At December 31, 2009, cash, cash equivalents and our investment securities totaled $9.1 billion, or 64.4% of total assets, with 17.7% of the $9.1 billion invested in cash and cash equivalents. Investment securities consist of debt securities of investment-grade quality with an average credit rating by S&P of AA+ at December 31, 2009 and an average duration of approximately 4.5 years. Including cash and cash equivalents, the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately 3.8 years. We had $5.5 million of mortgage-backed securities associated with Alt-A or subprime loans at December 31, 2009 and no collateralized debt obligations. Our net unrealized position improved $301.3 million from a net unrealized loss position of $229.9 million at December 31, 2008 to a net unrealized gain position of $71.4 million at December 31, 2009. Gross unrealized losses were $78.4 million at December 31, 2009 compared to $313.0 million at December 31, 2008. Gross unrealized gains were $149.8 million at December 31, 2009 compared to $83.2 million at December 31, 2008. All issuers of securities we own trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments. We believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased. As of December 31, 2009, we do not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized costs basis, and as a result, we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2009. During 2008, we recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $103.1 million of which $68.7 million resulted from investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., or Lehman, or its subsidiaries. Lehman and certain of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008. The other impairments primarily relate to declines in values of securities, primarily associated with the financial services industry. Of the $103.1 million, $48.5 million was allocated to the Government segment and $54.6 million was allocated to the Commercial segment. There were no material other-than-temporary impairments in 2009. We continuously review our investment portfolios. There is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. In addition, in the fall of 2008 we terminated all fixed to variable interest-rate swap agreements outstanding associated with our senior notes based on recent changes in the credit market environment. In exchange for terminating these interest-rate swap agreements, we received cash of $93.0 million representing the fair value of the swap assets. This transaction also fixed the interest rate on our senior notes to a weighted-average rate of 6.08%. We may re-enter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors. We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future, as well as to refinance or repay debt. Our long-term debt, consisting primarily of senior notes, of $1,678.2 million represented 22.5% of total capitalization at December 31, 2009, declining from 30.3% at December 31, 2008. The earliest maturity of our senior notes is in June 2016. We have available a 5-year, $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires in July 2011. As of December 31, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement. 37 Table of Contents Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. In 2009, our subsidiaries paid dividends of $774.1 million to the parent compared to $296.0 million in 2008. In addition, the parent made capital contributions to our subsidiaries of $132.3 million in 2009 compared to $242.8 million in 2008. Based on the statutory financial statements as of December 31, 2009, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $3.6 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries, $1.2 billion above the aggregate $2.4 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states. Other Highlights Earnings increased 60.6% to $6.15 per diluted common share in 2009 from $3.83 per diluted common share in 2008, primarily reflecting substantially lower stand-alone PDP claims expenses. Cash flows from operations increased $439.3 million to $1,421.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $982.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily resulted from increased earnings associated with lower stand-alone PDP prescription drug claims. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Recent Acquisitions On October 31, 2008 we acquired PHP Companies, Inc. (d/b/a Cariten Healthcare), or Cariten, for cash consideration of approximately $256.1 million. The Cariten acquisition increased our presence in eastern Tennessee, adding approximately 49,700 commercial fully-insured members, 21,600 commercial ASO members, and 46,900 Medicare HMO members. This acquisition also added approximately 85,700 Medicaid ASO members under a contract which expired on December 31, 2008 and was not renewed. On August 29, 2008, we acquired Metcare Health Plans, Inc., or Metcare, for cash consideration of approximately $14.9 million. The acquisition expanded our Medicare HMO membership in central Florida, adding approximately 7,300 members. On May 22, 2008, we acquired OSF Health Plans, Inc., or OSF, a managed care company serving both Medicare and commercial members in central Illinois, for cash consideration of approximately $87.3 million. This acquisition expanded our presence in Illinois, broadening our ability to serve multi-location employers with a wider range of products, including our specialty offerings. The acquisition added approximately 33,400 commercial fully-insured members, 29,700 commercial ASO members, and 14,000 Medicare HMO and PPO members. On April 30, 2008, we acquired UnitedHealth Group Las Vegas, Nevada individual SecureHorizons Medicare Advantage HMO business, or SecureHorizons, for cash consideration of approximately $185.3 million, plus subsidiary capital and surplus requirements of $40 million. The acquisition expanded our presence in the Las Vegas market, adding approximately 26,700 Medicare HMO members. On November 30, 2007, we acquired KMG America Corporation, or KMG, for cash consideration of $155.2 million plus the assumption of $36.1 million of long-term debt. KMG provides long-duration insurance benefits 38 Table of Contents including supplemental health and life products. This acquisition added approximately 95,900 members, primarily commercial ASO. On October 1, 2007, we acquired CompBenefits Corporation, or CompBenefits, for cash consideration of $369.6 million. CompBenefits provides dental and vision insurance benefits and added approximately 4.4 million specialty members. These acquisitions expanded our commercial product offerings allowing for significant cross-selling opportunities with our medical insurance products. On March 1, 2007, we acquired DefenseWeb Technologies, Inc., or DefenseWeb, a company responsible for delivering customized software solutions for the Department of Defense, for cash consideration of $27.5 million. Certain of these transactions are more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products. These tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion that follows. Summary Net income was $1,039.7 million, or $6.15 per diluted common share, in 2009 compared to $647.2 million, or $3.83 per diluted common share, in 2008. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher operating earnings in our Government segment as a result of significantly lower prescription drug claims expenses associated with our Medicare stand-alone PDP products. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 6.6%, to $29.9 billion for 2009, compared to $28.1 billion for 2008 primarily due to higher premium revenues in the Government segment. Premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Government segment premium revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 8.8%, to $22.8 billion for 2009 compared to $21.0 billion for 2008 primarily attributable to higher average Medicare Advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums partially offset by a decrease in our Medicare stand-alone PDP membership. 40 Table of Contents Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Average Medicare Advantage membership increased 11.5% in 2009 compared to 2008, including the impact from the 2008 acquisitions of Cariten, Metcare, OSF, and SecureHorizons, discussed previously. Sales of our PPO products drove the majority of the 72,600 increase in Medicare Advantage members since December 31, 2008. Medicare Advantage per member premiums increased 6.8% during 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the effect of introducing member premiums for most of our Medicare Advantage products. Medicare stand-alone PDP premium revenues decreased $1.1 billion, or 31.1%, during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 1,138,700, or 37.1%, decrease in PDP membership since December 31, 2008, principally resulting from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience. Commercial segment premium revenues increased $16.5 million, or 0.2%, to $7.1 billion for 2009 primarily due to the acquisitions of OSF and Cariten in the second and fourth quarters of 2008, respectively, and an increase in per member premiums, substantially offset by a decline in fully-insured membership. Per member premiums for fully-insured group accounts increased 5.0% during 2009 compared to 2008. Fully-insured membership decreased 7.0%, or 139,300 members, to 1,839,500 at December 31, 2009 compared to 1,978,800 at December 31, 2008 primarily due to the impact of the economic recession which has led to increased in-group member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees were $496.1 million for 2009, an increase of $44.2 million, or 9.8%, from $451.9 million for 2008, primarily due to an increase in per member fees, partially offset by a decline in Commercial ASO membership, primarily isolated to the loss of two larger ASO accounts. Investment Income Investment income totaled $296.3 million for 2009, an increase of $76.1 million from $220.2 million for 2008 primarily reflecting net realized losses in 2008 of $79.4 million compared to net realized gains of $19.5 million in 2009. Net realized losses in 2008 primarily resulted from other-than-temporary impairments in our investment and securities lending portfolios of $103.1 million. Excluding the change associated with net realized gains/losses, investment income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average invested balances as a result of the reinvestment of operating cash flow. Other Revenue Other revenue totaled $241.2 million for 2009, an increase of $31.8 million from $209.4 million for 2008. The increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to Right SourceRx SM , our mail-order pharmacy. Benefit Expenses Consolidated benefit expense was $24.8 billion for 2009, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 4.5%, from $23.7 billion for 2008. The increase primarily was driven by an increase in Government segment benefit expense, as described below. The consolidated benefit ratio for 2009 was 82.8%, a 170 basis point decrease from 84.5% for 2008. The decrease primarily was attributable to a decrease in the Government segment benefit ratio as described below. The Government segment benefit expenses increased $1.0 billion, or 5.7%, during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in the average number of Medicare Advantage members and the impact from the acquisitions of Cariten, Metcare, OSF, and SecureHorizons. The Government segment benefit ratio for 2009 41 Table of Contents was 83.5%, a 240 basis point decrease from 2008 of 85.9%, primarily driven by a 320 basis point decline in the Medicare benefit ratio. The decline in the Medicare benefit ratio primarily resulted from a substantial decline in Medicare stand-alone PDP benefit expenses as a result of our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience. The Commercial segment benefit expenses increased $36.3 million, or 0.6%, during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the OSF and Cariten acquisitions in the second and fourth quarters of 2008, respectively. The benefit ratio for the Commercial segment of 80.6% for 2009 increased 30 basis points from the 2008 benefit ratio of 80.3%, primarily reflecting higher utilization associated with the general economy and the highly competitive environment, as well as the impact of the H1N1 virus, partially offset by an increase in per member premiums. We experienced higher utilization of benefits in our fully-insured group accounts as in-group attrition, primarily as a result of reductions of less experienced workers, has led to a shift in the mix of members to an older workforce having more health care needs, as well as members utilizing more benefits ahead of actual or perceived layoffs, members seeking to maximize their benefits once their deductibles are met, and increased COBRA participation. SG&A Expense Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $282.9 million, or 7.2%, during 2009 compared to 2008. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in the average number of our employees due to the Medicare growth and higher average individual product membership. The average number of our employees increased 1,600 to 28,500 for 2009 from 26,900 for 2008, or 5.9%. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2009 was 13.8%, increasing 10 basis points from 13.7% for 2008 primarily due to an increase in the Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio as discussed below. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio is expected to decrease to a range of 13.0% to 13.5% for 2010 from efforts to realign our cost structure. Our Government and Commercial segments incur both direct and shared indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. SG&A expenses in the Government segment increased $137.0 million, or 6.2%, during 2009 compared to 2008. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 30 basis points from 10.6% for 2008 to 10.3% for 2009. The decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage membership. For example, during 2009 we transitioned the recently acquired OSF and Metcare members into our primary Medicare service platform and eliminated the cost of having duplicate platforms. Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $145.9 million, or 8.5%, during 2009 compared to 2008. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio increased 170 basis points from 22.4% for 2008 to 24.1% for 2009. The increase primarily was due to administrative costs associated with increased business for our mail-order pharmacy and higher average individual product membership. Average individual product membership increased 17.6% during 2009 compared to 2008. Individual accounts bear a higher SG&A expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2009 totaled $250.3 million compared to $220.4 million for 2008, an increase of $29.9 million, or 13.6%, primarily reflecting depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures since December 31, 2008. 42 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense was $105.8 million for 2009, compared to $80.3 million for 2008, an increase of $25.5 million, primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. In the second quarter of 2008, we issued $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018 and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038, the proceeds of which were used for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement. The weighted average effective interest rate for all of our long-term debt was 5.97% for 2009 and 4.73% for 2008. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for 2009 of 35.1% compared to the effective tax rate of 34.8% for 2008. The increase was due to a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income substantially offset by the reduction of the $16.8 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of audit settlements. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. We expect the 2010 effective tax rate to be approximately 36.0%.

Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products. These tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion that follows. Summary Net income was $647.2 million, or $3.83 per diluted common share, in 2008 compared to $833.7 million, or $4.91 per diluted common share, in 2007. The year-over-year decline primarily reflects lower operating earnings in our Government segment as a result of higher expenses associated with our Medicare stand-alone PDP products and lower net investment income primarily due to other-than-temporary impairments in our investment portfolios of $65.3 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased $3.7 billion, or 14.9%, to $28.1 billion for 2008, compared to $24.4 billion for 2007 primarily due to higher premium revenues in both the Government and Commercial segments. Premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Government segment premium revenues increased $2.8 billion, or 15.0%, to $21.0 billion for 2008 compared to $18.2 billion for 2007 primarily attributable to higher average Medicare Advantage membership and 44 Table of Contents an increase in per member premiums partially offset by a decrease in our Medicare stand-alone PDP membership. Average Medicare Advantage membership increased 18.7% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales of our PPO and PFFS products drove the majority of the 292,900 increase in Medicare Advantage members since December 31, 2007. The Cariten, OSF, SecureHorizons, and Metcare acquisitions also added 94,900 Medicare HMO and PPO members. Medicare Advantage per member premiums increased 3.9% during 2008 compared to 2007. Medicare stand-alone PDP premium revenues decreased 7.9% during the 2008 period compared to the 2007 period, primarily due to a 375,400, or 10.9%, decrease in PDP membership since December 31, 2007. Commercial segment premium revenues increased $0.9 billion, or 14.5%, to $7.1 billion for 2008 primarily due to our specialty product offerings, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and life products, as a result of the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007, as well as strategic line-of-business organic growth. Our fully-insured membership increased 9.4%, or 170,200 members, to 1,978,800 at December 31, 2008 compared to 1,808,600 at December 31, 2007. Excluding 83,100 fully-insured members added with the acquisitions of Cariten and OSF, the increase primarily was due to membership gains in Smart products and other consumer offerings, individual, and small group product lines. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees were $451.9 million for 2008, an increase of $60.4 million, or 15.4%, from $391.5 million for 2007, primarily due to higher rates, a shift in the mix of Commercial segment membership towards higher rate groups, and the impact from acquisitions. Investment Income Investment income totaled $220.2 million for 2008, a decrease of $94.0 million from $314.2 million for 2007, primarily reflecting other-than-temporary impairments in our investment and securities lending portfolios of $103.1 million recorded during 2008. Of the $103.1 million, $48.5 million was allocated to the Government segment and $54.6 million was allocated to the Commercial segment. Excluding these realized losses, investment income increased primarily due to higher average invested balances and net realized capital gains, partially offset by lower interest rates. Higher average invested balances primarily resulted from the reinvestment of operating cash flow and the acquired investment portfolio related to the KMG acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue totaled $209.4 million for 2008, an increase of $59.5 million from $149.9 million for 2007. The increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to Right SourceRx SM , our mail-order pharmacy. Benefit Expenses Consolidated benefit expense was $23.7 billion for 2008, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 17.0%, from $20.3 billion for 2007. The increase primarily was driven by an increase in Government segment benefit expense. The consolidated benefit ratio for 2008 was 84.5%, a 150 basis point increase from 83.0% for 2007. The increase primarily was attributable to a higher Government segment benefit ratio. The Government segment benefit expenses increased $2.7 billion, or 17.9%, during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in the average number of Medicare Advantage members. The Government segment benefit ratio for 2008 was 85.9%, a 210 basis point increase from 2007 of 83.8% primarily due to a higher Medicare stand-alone PDP benefit ratio from higher prescription drug utilization and an increase in the percentage of higher cost members in our Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans. 45 Table of Contents The Commercial segment benefit expense increased $709.4 million, or 14.2%, from 2008 to 2007. This increase primarily resulted from the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase in fully-insured membership and an increase in average per member claim costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation. The benefit ratio for the Commercial segment of 80.3% for 2008 decreased 20 basis points from the 2007 benefit ratio of 80.5% primarily reflecting an increase in average members in our specialty products from the acquisition of CompBenefits in the fourth quarter of 2007 and organic growth in our individual line of business. Individual and specialty, primarily dental and vision, accounts generally carry a lower benefit ratio and a higher SG&A expense ratio compared to larger accounts due to higher distribution costs. See related SG&A expense ratio discussion in the following section. SG&A Expense Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $468.2 million, or 13.5%, during 2008 compared to 2007. The increases primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees due to the Medicare growth, and the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions. The number of employees increased by 3,900 to 28,900 at December 31, 2008 from 25,000 at December 31, 2007, or 15.6%. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2008 was 13.7%, decreasing 20 basis points from 13.9% for 2007 primarily due to improving administrative cost efficiency associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage and Commercial medical membership, partially offset by growth in certain of our businesses which carry a higher administrative expense load such as mail-order pharmacy, specialty products, and individual medical products. Our Government and Commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. SG&A expenses in the Government segment increased $180.9 million, or 8.9%, during 2008 compared to 2007. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 60 basis points from 11.2% for 2007 to 10.6% for 2008. The decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage membership. The Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $287.3 million, or 20.0%, during 2008 compared to 2007. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio increased 90 basis points from 21.5% for 2007 to 22.4% for 2008. The increases primarily were due to an increase in specialty business, including the acquisition of CompBenefits and KMG in the fourth quarter of 2007, together with higher average individual product membership and increased mail-order pharmacy business. Average individual product membership increased 40.5% during 2008 compared to 2007. Specialty and individual accounts bear a higher SG&A expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2008 totaled $220.4 million compared to $184.8 million for 2007, an increase of $35.6 million, or 19.3%, reflecting higher intangible amortization expense due to acquisitions and increased capital expenditures. Interest Expense Interest expense was $80.3 million for 2008, compared to $68.9 million for 2007, an increase of $11.4 million, primarily due to higher average outstanding debt, partially offset by lower rates. 46 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for 2008 of 34.8% compared to the effective tax rate of 35.3% for 2007. The decrease primarily was due to a lower combined state income tax rate and a greater proportion of tax-exempt investment income to total pretax income in 2008. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. Liquidity Our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums, ASO fees, and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments, SG&A expenses, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and repayments on borrowings. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. The use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $1,613.6 million at December 31, 2009 from $1,970.4 million at December 31, 2008. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is summarized as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,421,582 $ 982,310 $ 1,224,262 Net cash used in investing activities (1,859,261 ) (498,324 ) (1,845,391 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 80,844 (554,016 ) 921,278 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (356,835 ) $ (70,030 ) $ 300,149 Cash Flow from Operating Activities The change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in earnings. Our 2008 operating cash flows and earnings were impacted by significantly higher prescription drug claim payments for our Medicare stand-alone PDPs as discussed previously. Comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and ASO fees and payments of benefit expenses. We illustrate these changes with the following summaries of receivables and benefits payable. 47 Table of Contents The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Change 2009 2008 (in thousands) Military services: Base receivable $ 451,248 $ 436,009 $ 404,570 $ 15,239 $ 31,439 Change orders 2,024 6,190 5,168 (4,166 ) 1,022 Military services subtotal 453,272 442,199 409,738 11,073 32,461 Medicare 238,056 232,608 137,345 5,448 95,263 Commercial and other 183,124 164,035 126,718 19,089 37,317 Allowance for doubtful accounts (50,832 ) (49,160 ) (68,260 ) (1,672 ) 19,100 Total net receivables $ 823,620 $ 789,682 $ 605,541 33,938 184,141 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Provision for doubtful accounts 19,054 5,398 Receivables from acquisition 6,974 (36,646 ) Change in receivables per cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations $ 59,966 $ 152,893 Military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees. The claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period. The timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the $15.2 million and $31.4 million increase in base receivables for 2009 as compared to 2008 and 2008 as compared to 2007, respectively, and the $47.9 million decrease in base receivables for 2007 as compared to 2006. Medicare receivables increased $5.4 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 and $95.3 million for 2008 as compared to 2007, and decreased $6.5 million for 2007 as compared to 2006. Medicare receivables are impacted by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model. The detail of benefits payable was as follows at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Change 2009 2008 (in thousands) IBNR(1) $ 1,902,700 $ 1,851,047 $ 1,695,088 $ 51,653 $ 155,959 Military services benefits payable(2) 279,195 306,797 341,372 (27,602 ) (34,575 ) Reported claims in process(3) 357,718 486,514 253,054 (128,796 ) 233,460 Other benefits payable(4) 682,961 561,221 407,319 121,740 153,902 Total benefits payable $ 3,222,574 $ 3,205,579 $ 2,696,833 16,995 508,746 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Benefits payable from acquisition (96,021 ) Change in benefits payable in cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations $ 16,995 $ 412,725 (1) IBNR represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR). 48 Table of Contents (2) Military services benefits payable primarily results from the timing of the cost of providing health care services to beneficiaries and the payment to the provider. A corresponding receivable for reimbursement by the federal government is included in the base receivable in the previous receivables table. (3) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff. (4) Other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements. The increase in benefits payable in 2009 primarily was due to an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements as well as an increase in IBNR, both primarily as a result of Medicare Advantage membership growth, partially offset by a decrease in the amount of processed but unpaid claims, including pharmacy claims, which fluctuate due to month-end cutoff. The increase in benefits payable in 2008 and 2007 primarily was due to the increase in IBNR from growth in Medicare Advantage members and, to a lesser extent, benefit claims inflation, an increase in the amount of processed but unpaid claims, including pharmacy claims, which fluctuate due to month-end cutoff, and an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements from Medicare Advantage membership growth. In addition to the timing of receipts for premiums and ASO fees and payments of benefit expenses, other working capital items impacting operating cash flows over the past three years primarily resulted from changes in the timing of collections of pharmacy rebates as well as the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions of our contracts with CMS. Cash Flow from Investing Activities We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities, primarily fixed income securities, totaling $1,975.2 million in 2009, $685.5 million in 2008, and $430.1 million in 2007. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review, and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $185.5 million in 2009, $261.6 million in 2008, and $239.2 million in 2007. Increased capital spending in 2008 included expenditures associated with constructing a new data center building and mail-order pharmacy warehouse and capital spending in 2007 included the purchase of three medical centers which were previously leased in South Florida. Excluding acquisitions, we expect total capital expenditures in 2010 of approximately $200 million. Cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $422.9 million in 2008 and $493.5 million in 2007 primarily related to the SecureHorizons, OSF, and Cariten acquisitions in 2008 and the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions in 2007. Cash Flow from Financing Activities In 2009, net borrowings under our credit agreement decreased $250.0 million primarily from the repayment of amounts borrowed to fund the acquisition of Cariten. During 2008, the net repayment of $550 million under our credit agreement primarily related to amounts repaid from the issuance of $750 million in senior notes offset by the $250 million financing of the Cariten acquisition. Net borrowings of $350 million under our credit agreement during 2007 primarily related to the financing of the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions. In June 2008, we issued $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018 and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038. Our net proceeds, reduced for the original issue discount and cost of the offering, were $742.6 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement. 49 Table of Contents Receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were $493.5 million higher than claims payments during 2009, $188.7 million higher than claim payments during 2008, and $185.1 million less than claims payments during 2007. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further description. In exchange for terminating interest-rate swap agreements in 2008, we received cash of $93.0 million. The remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2009, 2008, and 2007 primarily resulted from the change in the securities lending payable, common stock repurchases, proceeds from stock option exercises, and the excess tax benefit from stock compensation. The decrease in securities lending since 2007 resulted from lower margins earned under the program. During 2009, there were no repurchases of common shares under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors. During 2008, we repurchased 2.1 million common shares for $92.8 million under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors. We also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of $22.8 million in 2009, $13.3 million in 2008, and $27.4 million in 2007. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity Stock Repurchase Plan On February 22, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150 million of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 2.1 million shares in open market transactions for $92.8 million at an average price of $44.19. On July 28, 2008 (announced August 4, 2008), the Board of Directors increased the authorized amount to $250 million, excluding the $92.8 million used prior to that time in connection with the initial February 2008 authorization. No shares were repurchased in 2008 or 2009 under the July 2008 authorization. The July authorization was set to expire on December 31, 2009. On December 10, 2009 (announced December 11, 2009), the Board of Directors renewed its $250 million authorization through December 31, 2011. Under this authorized share repurchase program, shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchases, or in privately-negotiated transactions, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. We have not yet repurchased any shares under the December 2009 authorization. Senior Notes During 2008, we issued $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018 and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038. The 7.20% and 8.15% senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded (or subsequently upgraded) and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances. We also previously issued $300 million of 6.30% senior notes due August 1, 2018 and $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016. All four series of our senior notes, which are unsecured, may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified make-whole amount. Concurrent with the senior notes issuances, we entered into interest-rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. During 2008, we terminated all of our swap agreements. We may re-enter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors. Our senior notes and related swap agreements are more fully discussed in Notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Credit Agreement Our 5-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement expires in July 2011. Under the credit agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a revolving credit basis or a competitive advance basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The 50 Table of Contents spread, currently 50 basis points, varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 27 to 80 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 12.5 basis points, may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. In addition, a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for each day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50% of the total $1.0 billion commitment. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on LIBOR, at our option. The terms of the credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse event clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of $3,387.9 million at December 31, 2009 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0:1. We are in compliance with the financial covenants, with actual net worth of $5,776.0 million and a leverage ratio of 0.8:1, as measured in accordance with the credit agreement as of December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement. We have outstanding letters of credit of $3.5 million secured under the credit agreement. No amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2009, we had $996.5 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement, none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement. We have other customary, arms-length relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some parties to the credit agreement. Other Long-Term Borrowings Other long-term borrowings of $37.5 million at December 31, 2009 represent junior subordinated debt assumed in the 2007 KMG acquisition of $36.1 million and financing for the renovation of a building of $1.4 million. The junior subordinated debt, which is due in 2037, may be called by us in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 8.02% payable quarterly until 2012, and then payable at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 310 basis points. The debt associated with the building renovation bears interest at 2.00%, is collateralized by the building, and is payable in various installments through 2014. Liquidity Requirements We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future, and to refinance or repay debt. See the section entitled Risk Factors in this report. Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2009 was BBB- according to Standard & Poor Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa3 according to Moody Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s. A downgrade by S&P to BB+ or by Moody to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $750 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by $1.9 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $7.5 million. In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the parent company increased $415.1 million to $665.6 million at December 31, 2009 compared to $250.5 million at December 31, 2008. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. During 2009, our subsidiaries paid dividends of $774.1 million to the parent compared to $296.0 million in 2008 and $377.0 million in 2007. In addition, the parent made capital contributions to our subsidiaries of $132.3 million in 2009 compared to $242.8 million in 2008 and $307.3 million in 2007. 51 Table of Contents Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., the parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Based on the statutory financial statements as of December 31, 2009, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $3.6 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries, $1.2 billion above the aggregate $2.4 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states. Contractual Obligations We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2009 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Debt $ 1,587,528 $ 540 $ 614 $ 291 $ 1,586,083 Interest(1) 1,311,551 111,734 222,109 220,073 757,635 Operating leases(2) 598,913 133,634 218,684 136,415 110,180 Purchase obligations(3) 139,369 65,879 57,808 15,682 Future policy benefits payable and other long-term liabilities(4) 1,484,989 45,656 219,446 133,645 1,086,242 Total $ 5,122,350 $ 357,443 $ 718,661 $ 506,106 $ 3,540,140 (1) Interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements. (2) We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2019. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased such asset, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (4) Includes future policy benefits payable ceded to third parties through 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We expect the assuming reinsurance carriers to fund these obligations and reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverables included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts payable in less than one year are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. 52 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2009, we are not involved in any SPE transactions. Guarantees and Indemnifications Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held April 20, 2010 see Certain Transactions with Management and Others. Government Contracts Our Medicare business, which accounted for approximately 62% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily consisted of products covered under the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan contracts with the federal government. These contracts are renewed generally for a one-year term each December 31 unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare business have been renewed for 2010. CMS is continuing to perform audits of selected Medicare Advantage plans of various companies to validate the provider coding practices and resulting economics under the actuarial risk-adjustment model used to calculate the individual member capitation paid to Medicare Advantage plans. Several Humana contracts have been selected by CMS for audit and we expect that CMS will continue conducting audits for the 2007 contract year and beyond. We generally rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including risk-adjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions, which we generally send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. The CMS audits involve a review of a sample of provider medical records for the contracts being audited. Rates paid to Medicare Advantage plans are established under a bid model, the actuarial process whereby our premium is based on a comparison of our beneficiaries risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the government original Medicare program. As a result, we believe that an actuarially sound adjustment of payments from these audits would need to take into account the level of coding accuracy and provider medical 53 Table of Contents record documentation completeness under the government original Medicare program, since the risk adjustment system, bids, benefit structures and payment rates were premised on that data. This would help to ensure that the audit methodology applied to Medicare Advantage plans accurately calculates the economic impact of the audit findings. Additionally, our payment received from CMS, as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members, is based on bids that did not, by CMS design, include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments. We believe that applying a retroactive audit adjustment after CMS acceptance of bids would improperly alter this process of establishing member benefits and premiums. CMS has not formally announced its audit payment adjustment methodology, nor has CMS formally indicated whether the audit payment adjustment methodology will be based on a comparison to original Medicare coding accuracy. CMS has further indicated that it may make retroactive contract-level payment adjustments. Any such payment adjustments could occur as early as 2010, and could be effected prior to our, or other Medicare Advantage plans, having the opportunity to appeal audit findings or the underlying payment adjustment methodology. We continue to work with CMS and our industry group to submit comments to CMS regarding its proposed audit and appeals process, which CMS has published in a proposed rule and has referenced in informal guidance documents. We are unable to estimate the financial impact of any audits that may be conducted related to 2007 revenue and beyond or whether any findings would cause a change to our method of estimating future premium revenue in bid submissions made to CMS for future contract years, or compromise premium rate assumptions made in our bids for prior contract years. At this time, we do not know whether CMS will require payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology without comparison to original Medicare coding, and using its method of extrapolating findings to the entire contract. However, if CMS requires payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology without comparison to original Medicare coding, and using a method of extrapolating findings to the entire contract, and if we are unable to obtain any relief preventing the payment adjustments from being implemented, we believe that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our Medicaid business, which accounted for approximately 2% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2009, consists of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida, with the vast majority in Puerto Rico. Our Medicaid contracts with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, or PRHIA, for the East and Southeast regions were extended through December 31, 2009 with no change in terms. The PRHIA has confirmed its intention to extend the current contracts until June 30, 2010, with no changes in terms, and is in the process of executing such extensions. The loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our military services business, which accounted for approximately 12% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily consists of the TRICARE South Region contract. The original 5-year South Region contract expired March 31, 2009. Through an Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract to the TRICARE South Region contract, an additional one-year option period, the sixth option period, which runs from April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010, was exercised by the government. The Amendment also provides for two additional six-month option periods: the seventh option period runs from April 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010 and the eighth option period runs from October 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011. Exercise of each of the seventh and eighth option periods is at the government option. On December 16, 2009, we were notified by TMA that it intends to exercise its options to extend the TRICARE South Region contract for Option Period VII and Option Period VIII. The exercise of these option periods would effectively extend the TRICARE South Region contract through March 31, 2011. The contract transition provisions require the continuation of certain activities, primarily claims processing, during a wind-down period lasting approximately six months following the expiration date. Claims incurred on or prior to the expiration date would continue to be processed during the wind-down period under the terms existing prior to the expiration date. 54 Table of Contents As required under the current contract, the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for each option period are negotiated. Any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us. These changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In July 2009, we were notified by the Department of Defense that we were not awarded the third generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region which had been subject to competing bids. We filed a protest with the GAO in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the DoD and those that appear to have been used by the DoD in making its contractor selection. In October 2009, we learned that the GAO had upheld our protest, determining that the TMA evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the South Region. On December 22, 2009, we were advised that TMA notified the GAO of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the GAO decision with respect to our protest. At this time, we are not able to determine what actions TMA will take in response to recommendations by the GAO, nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the GAO will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefit expenses and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Benefit Expense Recognition Benefit expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows: December 31, 2009 Percentage of Total December 31, 2008 Percentage of Total (dollars in thousands) IBNR $ 1,902,700 59.0 % $ 1,851,047 57.7 % Reported claims in process 357,718 11.1 % 486,514 15.2 % Other benefits payable 682,961 21.2 % 561,221 17.5 % Benefits payable, excluding military services 2,943,379 91.3 % 2,898,782 90.4 % Military services benefits payable 279,195 8.7 % 306,797 9.6 % Total benefits payable $ 3,222,574 100.0 % $ 3,205,579 100.0 % 55 Table of Contents Military services benefits payable primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government as more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This amount is generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government, as more fully-described on page 48. Estimating IBNR is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in this estimate can materially affect, either favorably or unfavorably, our results of operations and overall financial position. Accordingly, it represents a critical accounting estimate. Most benefit claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider. As a result, these liabilities generally are described as having a short-tail . As such, we expect that substantially all of the December 31, 2009 estimate of benefits payable will be known and paid during 2010. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate. Therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. We develop our estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim experience. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent three months, the key assumption used in estimating our IBNR is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12-month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes. Completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period. For the most recent three months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, changes in member cost sharing, changes in medical management processes, product mix, and weekday seasonality. The completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result. Conversely, for the most recent three months of incurred claims, the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result, which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation. Changes in claim processes, including receipt cycle times, claim inventory levels, recoveries of overpayments, outsourcing, system conversions, and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors. The receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received. Increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last few years. For example, the average receipt cycle time has decreased from 15.6 days in 2007 to 14.0 days in 2009 which represents a 10.3% reduction in cycle time over the three year period. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claim may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using our completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. The drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities, physician services, prescription drugs, and new medical technologies, as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these 56 Table of Contents expense components. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, increases in medical services capacity, direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services, an aging population, catastrophes, and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends. Internal factors such as system conversions, claims processing cycle times, changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. All of these factors are considered in estimating IBNR and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Additionally, we continually prepare and review follow-up studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time. The results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management. The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2009 data: Completion Factor (a): Claims Trend Factor (b): Factor Change (c) Decrease in Benefits Payable Factor Change (c) Decrease in Benefits Payable (dollars in thousands) 1.10% $ (147,656 ) (5.50 )% $ (250,189 ) 1.00% $ (134,232 ) (4.25 )% $ (193,328 ) 0.90% $ (120,809 ) (3.50 )% $ (159,211 ) 0.80% $ (107,386 ) (2.75 )% $ (125,095 ) 0.70% $ (93,963 ) (2.00 )% $ (90,978 ) 0.60% $ (80,539 ) (1.25 )% $ (58,861 ) 0.50% $ (67,116 ) 0.00 % $ (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2009 caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent three months. (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2009 caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent three months. (c) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. The following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable, excluding military services. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefit expenses as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Balances at January 1 $ 2,898,782 $ 2,355,461 $ 1,979,733 Acquisitions 96,021 41,029 Incurred related to: Current year 21,934,973 21,092,135 18,015,247 Prior years (252,756 ) (268,027 ) (242,922 ) Total incurred 21,682,217 20,824,108 17,772,325 Paid related to: Current year (19,572,740 ) (18,579,247 ) (15,847,574 ) Prior years (2,064,880 ) (1,797,561 ) (1,590,052 ) Total paid (21,637,620 ) (20,376,808 ) (17,437,626 ) Balances at December 31 $ 2,943,379 $ 2,898,782 $ 2,355,461 57 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions. As previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. The amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefit expenses ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments. Favorable Development by Changes in Key Assumptions 2009 2008 2007 Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) (dollars in thousands) Trend factors $ (151,171 ) (3.5 )% $ (175,268 ) (5.2 )% $ (124,957 ) (4.3 )% Completion factors (101,585 ) 0.8 % (92,759 ) 1.0 % (63,985 ) 0.8 % Medicare Part D reconciliation n/a n/a (53,980 ) n/a Total $ (252,756 ) $ (268,027 ) $ (242,922 ) (a) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. As summarized in the table above, the majority of the favorable development resulted from trend factors for the most recent three months ultimately being lower than originally estimated for each of the years presented. Some of the more significant factors that drove the actual trend factors lower than the originally estimated trends over the last three years include lower than originally estimated utilization of hospital and physician services for both our Commercial and Medicare lines of business, as well as rapid growth in our Medicare Advantage and Commercial high deductible products in new geographic areas which resulted in more limited historical information from which to base trend rate estimates. Additionally, actual completion factors ultimately were higher than our original completion factors used to establish reserves at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, which were based upon historical patterns. This increase in completion factor percentage primarily resulted from a shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim submissions and improved claim recovery patterns associated with system and process changes. Finally, first-year Medicare Part D enrollment and eligibility issues during 2006 led to actual claim settlements with other health plans and various state governments during 2007 for amounts less than originally estimated. Similar adjustments in 2009 and 2008 were not significant due to a lower volume of new enrollees and subsequent improvements in the program enrollment process. We continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves. Because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards, there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our December 31, 2009 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table, as has occurred in previous years. Benefit expenses associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Military services $ 3,019,655 $ 2,819,787 $ 2,481,814 Future policy benefits 73,130 64,338 16,392 Total $ 3,092,785 $ 2,884,125 $ 2,498,206 58 Table of Contents Our TRICARE contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk of financing health benefits. The federal government both reimburses us for our cost of providing health benefits and bears responsibility for 80% of any variance from the annual target health care cost and actual health care cost as more fully described beginning on page 61. Therefore, the impact on our income from operations from changes in estimate for TRICARE benefits payable is reduced substantially by corresponding adjustments to revenues. The net decrease to income from operations as determined retrospectively, after giving consideration to claim development occurring in the current period, was approximately $7.8 million for 2008 and $13.7 million for 2007. The impact from changes in estimates for 2009 is not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2010 will change as our December 31, 2009 benefits payable estimate develops throughout 2010. Future policy benefits payable of $1,193.0 million and $1,164.8 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, represent liabilities for long-duration insurance policies including long-term care, health, and life insurance policies and annuities sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. These reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon actual experience. The basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our experience deteriorates to the point the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits. Future policy benefits payable include $571.9 million at December 31, 2009 and $503.2 million at December 31, 2008 associated with a closed block of long-term care policies acquired in connection with the November 30, 2007 KMG acquisition. Long-term care policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established. The risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of long-term care policies. We monitor the loss experience of these long-term care policies and, when necessary, apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold. We filed and received approval for certain state premium rate increases in 2009 and continue to expect to file for premium rate increases for additional states in 2010. To the extent premium rate increases and/or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions, future adjustments to reserves could be required. In addition, future policy benefits payable include amounts of $225.0 million at December 31, 2009 and $232.0 million at December 31, 2008 which are subject to 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other long-term assets. As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. The amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has been impacted by the growth in our Medicare business, coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member. However, our Medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section. 59 Table of Contents Premium revenues and ASO fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. In addition, we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay. Enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government, also known as retroactive membership adjustments, are estimated based on available data and historical trends. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in the current period revenue. We bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and members in our Medicare and individual products monthly. We receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. Changes in revenues from CMS for our Medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Medicare Part D Provisions We cover prescription drug benefits in accordance with Medicare Part D under multiple contracts with CMS. The payments we receive monthly from CMS and members, which are determined from our annual bid, represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage. We recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract. Our CMS payment is subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. In addition, we receive and disburse amounts for portions of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk, as described more fully below. The risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience. We record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or long-term in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected settlement. The estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain, including member eligibility differences with CMS. In 2009, we received net proceeds of $59.6 million related to our reconciliation with CMS regarding the 2008 Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of $55.4 million at December 31, 2008. In 2008, we paid $78.7 million related to our reconciliation with CMS regarding the 2007 Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of $102.6 million at December 31, 2007. The net liability associated with the 2009 risk corridor estimate, which will be settled in 2010, was $144.6 million at December 31, 2009. Reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent funding from CMS for its portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and related settlement of CMS prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year. We account for these subsidies as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We do not recognize premium revenues or benefit expense for these subsidies. Receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts 60 Table of Contents payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period. Gross financing receipts were $2,354.2 million and gross financing withdrawals were $1,860.7 million during 2009. CMS subsidy activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2009 was $11.7 million to other current assets and $402.9 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses. In order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage, CMS provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage, or coverage beyond CMS defined standard benefits. The demonstration payment option is an arrangement in which CMS pays a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the government portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage. The capitation amount represents a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer. We chose the demonstration payment option for some of our plans that offer enhanced coverage over the last three years and in 2010. This capitation amount, derived from our annual bid submissions, is recorded as premium revenue. The variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer is subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. This reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for CMS to administer the program. Medicare Risk-Adjustment Provisions CMS has implemented a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity. The CMS risk-adjustment model pays more for members with predictably higher costs, as described in Item 1. Business beginning on page 5. Under this risk-adjustment methodology, diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us. We generally rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including risk-adjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions, which we generally send to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk-adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to CMS and ultimately accepted by CMS. Military services In 2009, military services revenues represented approximately 12% of total premiums and administrative services fees. Military services revenue primarily is derived from our TRICARE South Region contract with the Department of Defense. The single TRICARE contract for the South Region includes multiple revenue generating activities. We allocate the consideration to the various components of the contract based on the relative fair value of the components. TRICARE revenues consist generally of (1) an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries; (2) health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government; and (3) administrative services fees related to claim processing, customer service, enrollment, disease management and other services. We recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided. Health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided. Administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed. The TRICARE South Region contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits. Annually, we negotiate a target health care cost amount, or target cost, with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee. Any variance from the target cost is shared. We earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance of actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost. We receive 20% for any cost underrun, subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10% of the target cost. We pay 20% for any cost overrun, subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4% of the target cost. A final settlement occurs 12 61 Table of Contents to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies. We defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. We estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefit expenses. We continually review these benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. The military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders. Change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract. Under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations. Change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $7,497.2 million, or 53% of total assets at December 31, 2009, and $5,215.4 million, or 40% of total assets at December 31, 2008. Debt securities, detailed below, comprised this entire investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 and over 99% of this investment portfolio at December 31, 2008. The fair value of debt securities were as follows at December 31, 2009 and 2008: December 31, 2009 Percentage of Total December 31, 2008 Percentage of Total (dollars in thousands) U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies: U.S. Treasury and agency obligations $ 1,009,352 13.5 % $ 599,898 11.5 % Mortgage-backed securities 1,688,663 22.5 % 1,297,705 24.9 % Tax-exempt municipal securities 2,224,041 29.7 % 1,689,462 32.5 % Mortgage-backed securities: Residential 95,412 1.3 % 347,308 6.7 % Commercial 279,626 3.7 % 260,299 5.0 % Asset-backed securities 107,188 1.4 % 144,370 2.8 % Corporate debt securities 2,079,568 27.7 % 855,827 16.4 % Redeemable preferred stock 13,300 0.2 % 10,050 0.2 % Total debt securities $ 7,497,150 100.0 % $ 5,204,919 100.0 % Approximately 99% of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with an average credit rating of AA+ by S&P at December 31, 2009. Most of the debt securities that are below investment-grade are rated BB or better, the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Tax exempt municipal securities included pre-refunded bonds of $346.9 million at December 31, 2009 and $694.8 million at December 31, 2008. These pre-refunded bonds are secured by an escrow fund consisting of U.S. government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity. The ratings of these pre-refunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations (AAA by S&P) at the time the fund is established. In addition, certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our tax exempt municipal securities. We have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers. We owned $587.2 million and $452.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of tax exempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers. The equivalent S&P credit rating of these tax-exempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was AA-. 62 Table of Contents Our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities backed by home equity loans. The fair value of securities backed by Alt-A and subprime loans was $5.5 million at December 31, 2009 and $7.6 million at December 31, 2008. There are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio. The percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 37.3% at December 31, 2009 and 41.7% at December 31, 2008. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 4.5 years at December 31, 2009. Including cash equivalents, the average duration was approximately 3.8 years. Based on the duration including cash equivalents, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately $340 million. Gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively: Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses (in thousands) December 31, 2009 U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies: U.S. Treasury and agency obligations $ 301,843 $ (2,425 ) $ 2,970 $ (109 ) $ 304,813 $ (2,534 ) Mortgage-backed securities 823,365 (11,005 ) 6,834 (323 ) 830,199 (11,328 ) Tax-exempt municipal securities 598,520 (14,286 ) 198,327 (9,131 ) 796,847 (23,417 ) Mortgage-backed securities: Residential 1,771 (5 ) 73,178 (10,994 ) 74,949 (10,999 ) Commercial 31,941 (359 ) 142,944 (8,281 ) 174,885 (8,640 ) Asset-backed securities 1,930 (19 ) 2,179 (88 ) 4,109 (107 ) Corporate debt securities 636,833 (9,354 ) 99,830 (11,972 ) 736,663 (21,326 ) Total debt securities $ 2,396,203 $ (37,453 ) $ 526,262 $ (40,898 ) $ 2,922,465 $ (78,351 ) In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued new guidance to address concerns about (1) measuring the fair value of financial instruments when the markets become inactive and quoted prices may reflect distressed transactions and (2) recording impairment charges on investments in debt securities. The new guidance highlights and expands on the factors that should be considered in estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for a financial asset or liability has significantly decreased and requires new disclosures relating to fair value measurement inputs and valuation techniques (including changes in inputs and valuation techniques). In addition, new guidance regarding recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments changed (1) the trigger for determining whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists and (2) the amount of an impairment charge to be recorded in earnings. We adopted the provisions of the new guidance for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Refer to Note 4 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for disclosures related to the implementation of the new guidance. 63 Table of Contents Under the new other-than-temporary impairment model for debt securities held, we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis. However, if we do not intend to sell the debt security, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. When we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, potential OTTI is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies; the volatility of the fair value changes; and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. For example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. A decline in fair value is considered other-than-temporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations, facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time, or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. There is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. Approximately $19.6 million of our unrealized losses at December 31, 2009 relate to our residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Factors such as seniority, underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements support the recoverability of these securities. Residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities are primarily composed of senior tranches having high credit support, with 99% of the collateral consisting of prime loans. All commercial mortgage-backed securities are rated AAA at December 31, 2009. All issuers of securities we own trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased. As of December 31, 2009, we do not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, and as a result, we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2009. There were no material other-than-temporary impairments in 2009 or 2007. Gross realized losses in 2008 included other-than-temporary impairments of $103.1 million, primarily due to investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008, as well as declines in the values of securities primarily associated with the financial services industry. Goodwill and Long-lived Assets At December 31, 2009, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 21% of total assets and 50% of total stockholders equity, compared to 23% and 67%, respectively, at December 31, 2008. 64 Table of Contents We are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable Commercial and Government segments. A component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows. We rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value. However outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We use discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. Key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical and administrative cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, including the impact of the ultimate outcome of health care reform legislation, if any, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. The fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a margin ranging from approximately 33% to 83%. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease this margin to a range of approximately 15% to 63%. The ultimate loss of the TRICARE South Region contract would adversely affect $49.8 million of the military services reporting unit goodwill. In July 2009, we were notified by the DoD that we were not awarded the third generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region which had been subject to competing bids. We filed a protest with the GAO in connection with the award to another contractor and in October 2009 we learned that the GAO had upheld our protest, determining that the TMA evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the South Region. On December 22, 2009, we were advised that TMA notified the GAO of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the GAO decision with respect to our protest. At this time, we are not able to determine what actions TMA will take in response to recommendations by the GAO, nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the GAO will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award. Our current TRICARE South Region contract covers benefits for healthcare services provided to beneficiaries through March 31, 2010. On December 16, 2009, we were notified by TMA that it intends to exercise its options to extend the TRICARE South Region contract for Option Period VII and Option Period VIII. The exercise of these option periods would effectively extend the TRICARE South Region contract through March 31, 2011. We will continue to assess the fair value of our military services reporting unit each reporting period based on our estimate of future discounted cash flows associated with the reporting unit, primarily derived from cash flows associated with the TRICARE South Region contract. We will recognize a goodwill impairment if and when our impairment test indicates that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. We expect that as the ultimate March 31, 2011 contract end date nears, if our current contract is not extended further and we are not awarded the new third generation TRICARE program contract for the South Region, future cash flows will not be sufficient to warrant recoverability of all or a portion of the TRICARE goodwill. Given these facts, we would expect a goodwill impairment during the second half of 2010. Refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of the TRICARE South Region contract. 65 Table of Contents Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. There were no impairment losses in the last three years. Long-lived assets associated with our military services business are not material. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance that expands and clarifies existing disclosures about fair value measurements. Under the new guidance, we will be required to disclose information about movements of assets among Levels 1 and 2 of the three-tier fair value hierarchy and present separately (that is on a gross basis) information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of financial instruments in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). In addition, the new guidance clarified that we are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of financial assets and liabilities and provide disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques for fair value measurements in either Level 2 or Level 3. These new disclosures and clarifications are effective for us beginning with the filing of our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2010, except for the gross disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for us beginning with the filing of our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2011.
