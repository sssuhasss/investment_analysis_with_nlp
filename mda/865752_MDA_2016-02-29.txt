(See Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 7A Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks ). Our Business Acquisitions and Divestitures On June 12, 2015, Old Monster, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreements entered into with TCCC on August 14, 2014, which provided for the TCCC Transaction. Also, on June 12, 2015, Old Monster effected the Holding Company Reorganization, and the Company changed its name from New Laser Corporation to Monster Beverage Corporation. In the Holding Company Reorganization, each Old Monster common share, par value $0.005 per share, outstanding immediately prior to consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization (other than any Old Monster common shares owned by Old Monster immediately prior to the closing of the TCCC Transaction, which were cancelled) was converted automatically into the right to receive one Company common share, par value $0.005 per share. In addition, upon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization: each unexercised and unexpired stock option then outstanding under any equity compensation plan of Old Monster, whether or not then exercisable, ceased to represent a right to acquire Old Monster common shares and was converted automatically into a right to acquire the same number of Company common shares, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Old Monster stock option; and 38 Table of Contents each share of restricted stock and each restricted stock unit of Old Monster granted under all outstanding equity compensation plans ceased to represent or relate to Old Monster common shares and was converted automatically to represent or relate to Company common shares, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Old Monster restricted stock and restricted stock units (including the vesting or other lapse restrictions (without acceleration thereof by virtue of the Holding Company Reorganization and the TCCC Transaction)). Promptly following the effective time of the Holding Company Reorganization, Old Monster assigned to the Company all obligations of Old Monster under Old Monster equity compensation plans and each stock option agreement, restricted stock award agreement, restricted stock unit award agreement and any similar agreement entered into pursuant to such equity compensation plans. In addition, all obligations of Old Monster under any employment agreements and indemnification agreements were assigned to the Company. Immediately after the effective time of the Holding Company Reorganization, (1) the Company issued to TCCC the New Issuance and TCCC appointed two individuals to the Company Board of Directors, (2) TCCC transferred all of its rights in and to KO Energy to the Company, (3) Old Monster transferred all of its rights in and to Monster Non-Energy to TCCC, (4) the Company and TCCC amended the distribution coordination agreements previously existing between them to govern the transition of third parties rights to distribute the Company energy products in most territories in the U.S. to members of TCCC distribution network, which consists of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottlers/distributors, and (5) TCCC and one of its subsidiaries made an aggregate net cash payment to the Company of $2.15 billion, $125.0 million of which is currently held in escrow as described below pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, subject to release upon the achievement of milestones relating to the transition of distribution rights to TCCC distribution network. On the one-year anniversary of the closing of the TCCC Transaction, the then-remaining escrow amount, less an amount sufficient to cover any unresolved claims, will be released to TCCC. Any amount described above that becomes payable following the one-year anniversary will be paid directly from TCCC to the Company. As of February 29, 2016, distribution rights in the U.S. representing approximately 89% of the target case sales have been transitioned to TCCC distribution network. As a result, $125 million is currently held in escrow. The Company expects to transition sufficient additional distribution rights to result in the release of all remaining amounts held in escrow. Therefore, the Company believes that achievement of the milestones is probable. In accordance with ASC No. 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , the Company expenses distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination occurs. As a result, the Company incurred termination amounts of $224.0 million, ($0.2) million and $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to distribution rights transferred. Such termination amounts have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. In addition, the Company recognized as income $39.8 million in the first quarter of 2015, related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company prior distributors who were sent notices of termination during the first quarter of 2015. The following table summarizes the selected items discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: Income Statement Items (in thousands): 2015 2014 2013 Included in Net Sales: Accelerated recognition of deferred revenue $ 39,761 $ - $ - Included in Operating Expenses: Distributor termination costs 224,000 ( 157 ) 10,754 TCCC Transaction expenses 15,496 4,824 - Gain on sale of Monster Non-Energy 161,470 - - Net Impact on Operating Income $ (38,265) $ (4,667) $ (10,754) 39 Table of Contents Overview We develop, market sell and distribute energy drink beverages and/or concentrates for energy drink beverages, primarily under the following brand names: Monster Energy Nalu Monster Rehab NOS Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Full Throttle Java Monster Burn Muscle Monster Mother Mega Monster Energy Ultra Punch Monster Play and Power Play Juice Monster Gladiator M3 Relentless bermonster Samurai BU BPM Our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which represented 92.5%, 93.9% and 93.2% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily include the following: Monster Energy Java Monster Kona Blend Lo-Carb Monster Energy Java Monster Loca Moca Monster Assault Java Monster Mean Bean Juice Monster Khaos Java Monster Vanilla Light Juice Monster Ripper Java Monster Irish Blend Juice Monster Pipeline Punch Java Monster Cappuccino Monster Energy Absolutely Zero Mega Monster Energy Monster Energy Import Punch Monster Baller Blend (formerly Dub Edition) Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Super Dry Punch Monster Mad Dog (formerly Dub Edition) Monster Rehab Tea + Lemonade + Energy Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Anti-Gravity Monster Rehab Raspberry Tea + Energy (formerly Rojo) M3 Monster Energy Super Concentrate Monster Rehab Green Tea + Energy Monster Energy Zero Ultra Monster Rehab Tea + Orangeade + Energy Monster Energy Ultra Blue Monster Rehab Tea + Pink Lemonade + Energy Monster Energy Ultra Red Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy Monster Energy Ultra Black Muscle Monster Vanilla Monster Energy Ultra Sunrise Muscle Monster Chocolate Monster Energy Ultra Citron Muscle Monster Strawberry Muscle Monster Banana Monster Ghost M-100 Monster Phantom M-100 Monster Energy Unleaded bermonster Energy Brew Monster Energy Valentino Rossi 40 Table of Contents We have three operating and reportable segments, (i) Finished Products, (ii) Concentrate and (iii) Other, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction (previously comprising the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea brand). During 2015, we continued to expand our existing energy drink portfolio and further develop our distribution markets. During 2015, we introduced the following Monster Energy brand energy drink products, in addition to the Strategic Brands acquired as part of the TCCC Transaction: Monster Energy Ultra Citron , a carbonated energy drink which contains zero calories and zero sugar (January 2015). Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy (January 2015). Juice Monster Pipeline Punch (July 2015). Muscle Monster Banana (July 2015). Monster Ghost M-100 , an exclusive limited time listing with a convenience customer (July 2015). Monster Phantom M-100 , an exclusive limited time listing with certain convenience customers (July 2015). Monster Rehab Raspberry Tea + Energy (August 2015). In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products or product lines discontinued during the year ended December 31, 2015 (other than those disposed of as part of the TCCC Transaction), either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Our net sales of $2,722.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 represented record annual net sales. The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks were $2,518.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $204.0 million, or 79.2% of our overall increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Any decrease in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. Net sales of our Strategic Brands acquired as part of the TCCC Transaction were $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Finished Products segment of approximately $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Concentrate segment of approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, personality endorsements (including from television and other well-known sports personalities), sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands. We are currently evaluating our future strategy for the positioning of our Strategic Brands. 41 Table of Contents We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $713.2 million, $657.9 million and $580.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Such sales were approximately 23% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales to customers outside the United States of approximately 14%, 1% and 2% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military. Gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such distributors sales to their own customers. 2015 2014 2013 U.S. full service bottlers/distributors 65% 62% 63% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 9% 9% 9% International full service bottlers/distributors 23% 23% 23% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 2% 4% 3% Other 1% 2% 2% Our customers include the TCCC North American Bottlers, CCE, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Swire Coca-Cola, USA and certain other Coca-Cola independent bottlers, Asahi, Kalil Bottling Group, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), Costco and AB Distributors. In February 2015, in accordance with its existing agreements with the applicable AB Distributors, the Company sent notices of termination to the majority of the AB Distributors in the United States for the termination of their respective distribution agreements, to be effective at various dates beginning in March 2015. The associated distribution rights have been transitioned to TCCC network of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottlers/distributors as of the effective date of termination of the AB Distributors rights in the applicable territories (see Note 9 Distribution Agreements in the notes to consolidated financial statements). The TCCC Subsidiaries accounted for approximately 42%, 29% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 42 Table of Contents We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: International Growth The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our Monster Energy brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. The TCCC Transaction is expected to secure fully aligned access to TCCC leading global distribution system, which we anticipate will accelerate our international performance. In addition, we anticipate that the TCCC Transaction will provide scale and platform synergies in a range of international geographies where we currently have limited presence, which is expected to increase our energy business in a number of international markets and establish a strong presence in additional countries. Profitable Growth We believe functional value added brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we have expanded our energy drinks, including through the addition of TCCC existing energy product lines in connection with the TCCC Transaction, to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on building upon the respective profit margins for both the Finished Products segment and the Concentrate segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. Cost Management The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input supply and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand also remains a further key area of focus. Efficient Capital Structure Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. Furthermore, following the TCCC Transaction, we have a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents, and we expect that a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents will be used to return capital to our shareholders pursuant to share repurchases, which may be effected pursuant to open market transactions, a modified Dutch auction tender offer, accelerated share repurchase, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing, terms and amount of any such share repurchase will be determined by the Company board of directors. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S. and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. 43 Table of Contents Gross and net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2016 and beyond ( See Part II, Item 7 Results of Operations Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 ). As of December 31, 2015, the Company had working capital of $3,068.4 million compared to $1,297.4 million as of December 31, 2014. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of cash received in the TCCC Transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $208.0 million as compared to $585.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Principal uses of cash flows in 2015 were purchases of investments, share repurchases, purchases of inventory, development of our Monster Energy brand internationally, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See Part II, Item 7 Liquidity and Capital Resources ). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and our Company, including our significant commercial relationships with TCCC and TCCC status as a significant shareholder of the Company, in each case as described above under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S. state and/or county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company. In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product line. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. 44 Table of Contents In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company future financial results include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the realization of benefits from the TCCC Transaction, including the transition of the distribution of our products to TCCC distribution network; changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; maintenance of our brand image and product quality; increasing concern over various health matters, including obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See Part I, Item 1 Business Competition and Part I, Item 1 Business Sales and Marketing ); costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in related government regulations; and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients due to port strikes and related labor issues; protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap-can and co-packing availability; and the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: domestic and international growth potential of our products due to our transition to a leading global distribution network and the scale and platform synergies expected in connection with the TCCC Transaction; growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally; planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability; the introduction of premium and/or new packages designed to generate strong revenue growth; redesign, repackaging and repositioning of our Strategic Brands; significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth; effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth; broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets; launching our products into new geographic markets such as China; and continued focus on reducing our cost base. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth key statistics for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Included in the $62.8 million recognition of deferred revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, is $39.8 million related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company prior distributors who were sent notices of termination during the first quarter of 2015. Includes $224.0 million, ($0.2) million and $10.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to distributor termination costs. *Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. 46 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014. Net Sales. Net sales were $2,722.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $257.7 million, or 10.5% higher than net sales of $2,464.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $204.0 million of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Net sales of our Strategic Brands were $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales for the Other segment, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015 (previously comprising the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea brand), decreased $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $39.8 million related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company prior distributors. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Finished Products segment of approximately $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Concentrate segment of approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 274.6 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately 36.3 million cases or 15.3% higher than case sales of 238.3 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2014. The overall average net sales per case decreased to $9.91 for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was 4.2% lower than the average net sales per case of $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The lower average net sales per case was primarily attributable to sales of concentrates and/or beverage bases in the Concentrate segment, which generally generate lower net operating revenues than those products within the Finished Products segment. Net sales for the Finished Products segment were $2,518.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $204.0 million, or 8.8% higher than net sales of $2,314.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net sales for the Concentrate segment were $143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to December 31, 2015). There were no net sales for the Concentrate segment for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net sales for the Other segment, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction (previously comprising the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea brand), were $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from January 1, 2015 to June 12, 2015), a decrease of approximately $89.6 million, or 59.6% lower than net sales of $150.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,632.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $292.5 million, or 21.8% higher than the gross profit of $1,339.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 60.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in gross 47 Table of Contents profit dollars was primarily the result of the $204.0 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, the $143.3 million of net sales for the Concentrate segment as well as the $39.8 million accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company prior distributors. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the Concentrate segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the decrease in the net sales of the Other segment, which generally has lower gross margins than the Finished Products segment, and the $39.8 million accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company prior distributors, as well as due to changes in product sales mix and lower costs of certain sweeteners and other raw materials. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $900.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $307.8 million, or 52.0% higher than total operating expenses of $592.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased costs of $224.2 million associated with terminating certain existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in operating expenses was attributable to increased payroll expenses of $30.0 million (of which $11.9 million was related to payroll taxes in connection with the exercise of certain stock options), increased expenditures of $16.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements and increased expenditures of $10.7 million for transaction expenses related to the TCCC Transaction. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the Finished Products segment was $836.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of approximately $68.1 million, or 7.5% lower than contribution margin of $904.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Finished Products segment was primarily the result of the increased expenditures of $224.2 million relating to the costs associated with terminating certain existing distributors. Contribution margin for the Concentrate segment was $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was no contribution margin for the Concentrate segment for the year ended December 31, 2014. Contribution margin for the Other segment was $165.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (effectively from January 1 to June 12), as compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in contribution margin for the Other segment was primarily the result of the $161.5 million gain on the sale of Monster Non-Energy. Operating Income. Operating income was $893.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $146.1 million, or 19.6% higher than operating income of $747.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the $292.5 million increase in gross profit as well as the $161.5 million gain on the sale of Monster Non-Energy. The increase in operating income in dollars was offset by increased costs of $224.2 million associated with terminating certain existing distributors as well as the increase in other operating expenses. Operating income was $51.5 million and $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other Expense, net . Other expense, net was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to other expense, net of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Provision for income taxes was $344.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $82.2 million or 31.3% higher than the provision for income taxes of $262.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate increased to 38.7% from 35.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the disallowance for tax purposes of certain 48 Table of Contents costs related to the TCCC Transaction, the decrease in tax benefits relating to the domestic production deduction and the establishment of valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, the profits, or a portion thereof, earned in certain foreign subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2014 had no related tax expense as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their deferred tax assets. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was partially offset by the release of the valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions. Net Income . Net income was $546.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $63.5 million or 13.2% higher than net income of $483.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013. Net Sales. Net sales were $2,464.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $218.4 million, or 9.7% higher than net sales of $2,246.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $220.1 million, or 100.9%, of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand as well as our expansion into new international markets. Price increases on our 24-ounce Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our former Peace Tea line represented approximately 7% of the overall increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Collective changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 238.3 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately 16.9 million cases or 7.6% higher than case sales of 221.3 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2013. The overall average net sales per case increased to $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was 1.9% higher than the average net sales per case of $10.15 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net sales for the Finished Products segment were $2,314.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $220.1 million, or 10.5% higher than net sales of $2,094.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. There were no net sales for the Concentrate segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Net sales for the Other segment, the principal products of which include the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction (previously comprising the majority of the former Warehouse segment and the Peace Tea brand), were $150.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of approximately $1.7 million, or 1.1% lower than net sales of $152.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,339.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $166.9 million, or 14.2% higher than the gross profit of $1,172.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $220.1 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to lower promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, price increases on our 24-ounce 49 Table of Contents Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our former Peace Tea line, changes in product sales mix, lower costs of certain sweeteners and other raw materials as well as an increase in production efficiencies. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $592.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of approximately $7.7 million, or 1.3% lower than total operating expenses of $600.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in operating expenses was partially attributable to decreased expenditures of $10.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors, decreased expenditures of $9.9 million for premiums, decreased expenditures of $8.6 million for allocated trade development, a $2.5 million non-routine indirect tax related provision recorded in the third quarter of 2013, subsequently reversed in the second quarter of 2014 for non-realization, and decreased expenditures of $4.0 million for point-of-sale materials. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $7.2 million, increased expenditures of $6.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased payroll expenses of $6.4 million (inclusive of decreased stock-based compensation of $0.2 million), increased expenditures of $2.7 million related to regulatory matters and litigation concerning our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and expenditures of $4.8 million for professional service costs related to the TCCC Transaction. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the Finished Products segment was $904.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $175.9 million, or 24.2% higher than contribution margin of $728.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the contribution margin for the Finished Products segment was primarily the result of the $241.1 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Other segment was $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $10.7 million higher than contribution loss of ($3.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2013. There was no contribution margin for the Concentrate segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Operating Income. Operating income was $747.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of approximately $174.6 million, or 30.5% higher than operating income of $572.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales as well as the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. The increase in operating income in dollars was primarily due to an increase of $166.9 million in gross profit. Operating income (loss) was $37.8 million and ($12.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. Other Expense, net . Other expense, net was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to other expense, net of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Foreign currency transaction losses were $3.4 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in foreign currency losses during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to our foreign currency transactions in Australia, Japan, Ireland and South Africa. Interest income was $1.1 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes was $262.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $37.4 million or 16.6% higher than the provision for income taxes of $225.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 35.2% from 39.9% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of profits earned in certain foreign subsidiaries that have no related income tax expense, as a result of the prior establishment of valuation allowances on their deferred tax assets. 50 Table of Contents Net Income . Net income was $483.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $144.5 million or 42.7% higher than net income of $338.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $166.9 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes of $37.4 million. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Gross sales**. Gross sales were $3,105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $278.6 million, or 9.9% higher than gross sales of $2,827.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $222.1 million, or 79.7%, of the overall increase in gross sales.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Finished Products segment of approximately $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales in the Concentrate segment of approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain of our international business.

The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross sales with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales: In thousands Percentage Change Percentage Change 2015 2014 2013 15 vs. 14 14 vs. 13 Gross sales, net of discounts and returns $ 3,105,665 $ 2,827,092 $ 2,586,531 9.9% 9.3% Less: Promotional and other allowances*** 383,101 362,225 340,103 5.8% 6.5% Net Sales $ 2,722,564 $ 2,464,867 $ 2,246,428 10.5% 9.7% ***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company bottlers/distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the bottler s/distributors sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company promotional allowance programs with its numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates as if converted into finished products, sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. In addition, our experience with our 52 Table of Contents energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $208.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $585.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. 53 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $546.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $32.7 million of stock-based compensation and $30.9 million of depreciation and other amortization.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $483.2 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $28.6 million of stock-based compensation and $25.7 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $42.8 million decrease in inventory, a $20.5 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, an $11.3 million increase in accounts payable, an $8.4 million increase in income taxes payable, a $4.6 million decrease in distributor receivables, a $3.4 million increase in accrued compensation and a $3.0 million increase in accrued liabilities.

Cash flows used in investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $400.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to cash used of $440.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of property and equipment, and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments and to purchases of property and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by investing activities included $198.0 million from the sale of Monster Non-Energy and $179.7 million from the transfer of distribution rights pursuant to the TCCC Transaction. For both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, cash provided by investing activities was also attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, and for other corporate purposes, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets. From time to time, we may also purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses as a use of cash in excess of our requirements for operations. Cash flows provided by financing activities. We generated $1,202.3 million of cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $19.3 million for the year 54 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities of $1,202.3 million was primarily the result of the issuance of our common stock to TCCC during the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the TCCC Transaction. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property and coolers), leasehold improvements, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments As of December 31, 2015, we had $2,175.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $760.0 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Of our $2,175.4 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2015, $174.3 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2015. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries other than to repay certain intercompany debt owed to our U.S. operations. Under current tax laws, if funds in excess of intercompany amounts owed were repatriated to our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay additional income taxes on such excess funds at the tax rates then in effect. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be approximately $2.8 billion through December 31, 2016, including the completion of our purchase of American Fruits and Flavors as well as additional share repurchases as authorized by our Board of Directors on February 24, 2016 (see Note 20 Subsequent Events in the notes to consolidated financial statements). However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. 55 Table of Contents The following represents a summary of the Company contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2015: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations $ 111,615 $ 67,356 $ 44,199 $ 60 $ - Capital Leases 811 811 - - - Operating Leases 10,725 7,202 1,945 838 740 Purchase Commitments 40,794 40,794 - - - $ 163,945 $ 116,163 $ 46,144 $ 898 $ 740 Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. In addition, approximately $0.5 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2015. It is expected that any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months will not be significant. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.2 million as of December 31, 2015. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Business Combinations Business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805 Business Combinations . ASC 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. The acquiree results are included in the Company consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). The acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the Company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Throughout the year, the Company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future. Investments The Company investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with ASC 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that the Company intends to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in 56 Table of Contents the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the Credit Loss ) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. The Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. In accordance with ASC 210-20-45, in its consolidated balance sheets, the Company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. All other accounts receivable and related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net realizable value). Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. The related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income. Goodwill The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses 57 Table of Contents qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. Other Intangibles Other Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the Company exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy , , Monster Rehab , Java Monster , Unleash the Beast , Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology , Muscle Monster , Mega Monster Energy , Punch Monster , Juice Monster , M3 , Ubermonster , BU , Nalu , NOS , Full Throttle , Burn , Mother , Ultra , Play and Power Play , Gladiator , Relentless , Samurai and BPM trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. The Company also owns in its own right a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. In accordance with ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no impairments recorded. Long-Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management estimates of the business risks. Preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no impairment indicators identified. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The accounts of the Company foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with ASC 830. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2015 have terms of one month or less. We do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes. 58 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to the Company finished products passes to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of the Company distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the Company behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to the Company products that are co-packed on the Company behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when the Company is notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the Company finished goods. Revenue for the Concentrate Segment is generally recognized when title to the concentrate is transferred to the customer. In particular, title to the concentrate usually passes upon shipment to the customers locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. The Company promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for the anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expense and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company historical experience. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the costs of concentrates and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company prior distributors, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Income Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future taxable income and the 59 Table of Contents availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future the Company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
