Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report. Executive Overview After two consecutive years of falling oil demand in 2008 and 2009 induced by the global economic recession, a strong recovery occurred in 2010. Consumption averaged 87.7 million barrels per day, including an all-time peak of over 89 million barrels per day in December, and made the year-on-year increase the second largest in three decades. Oil prices remained in the range of $65-$85 per barrel for much of 2010, but recorded a spike above $90 at the end of the year. The major demand forecasts released during 2010 have continued to increase as a result of the improving economic outlook particularly in the developing economies. On the supply side, the adherence to production quota by the OPEC countries helped keep the market balanced, although such adherence diminished slightly as the year progressed. Strength in non-OPEC production, improvement in new project developments following the investment cuts in 2009, and lower production costs helped provide additional assurance to the markets. Natural gas markets behaved differently. Decreasing gas demand during the recession, increasing unconventional gas production in North America, and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas export facilities around the world led to an over-supplied market with consequent pressure on spot prices. Within the United States the world largest natural gas market natural gas storage levels have remained significantly above the five-year range since March 2010 despite lower volumes of Canadian gas imports and some power generation fuel switching from coal to gas. With natural gas price forecasts from the Energy Information Agency for 2011 slipping by nearly a third compared to initial projections made at the beginning of the year, an increasing portion of the drilling and completion activity in shale reservoirs has shifted to liquid and condensate-rich plays in North America. Within this market, Schlumberger Oilfield Services full-year revenue in 2010 of $22.08 billion grew 8% versus 2009, driven by recovery in the North America natural gas market through increasing demand and stronger pricing for pressure pumping services. The North America Area also benefited from greater activity in liquids-rich plays in a number of basins. Offshore, the tragic Macondo accident in the US Gulf of Mexico led to a shutdown in deepwater operations that severely impacted US offshore activity and led to slowdowns in other parts of the world, although these were being absorbed as the fourth quarter developed. The Middle East and Asia Area revenue climbed 7% from a number of factors including increasing wireline logging and expanded IPM work. Latin America revenue grew by 2%, with rapid growth in Brazil overcoming weaker activity in Mexico as poor weather, increasing security concerns and reduced client budgets impacted operations. Europe/CIS/Africa revenue decreased 4% versus 2009. Among the Technologies, growth was primarily seen in Well Services activities, both in volume and in price although the acquisition of Geoservices also contributed to the increase. In addition to growing activity, results were underpinned through continuing market penetration of new-technology services such as Scope* advanced logging-while-drilling measurements, Scanner* wireline technologies, and ACTive* coiled-tubing services. Scanner services were boosted by the commercial introduction of the latest family member, the Dielectric Scanner* tool, which was unveiled during the year. As a unique industry service capable of measuring saturation in a variety of reservoir applications, the service completed a two-year pilot project in Saudi Arabia targeted at reservoir monitoring, where 35 logs were recorded in various fields, both on land and offshore, to assess water flooding sweep efficiency as an aid to field development planning. In reservoir production, ACTive real-time coiled tubing services saw growth, particularly with ACTive conveyance of Wireline Flow Scanner* production logging technology, and with fiber-optic continuous measurements of temperature and pressure along the well bore. Growing deployment of integrated technologies such as these confirms exciting growth possibilities across the Schlumberger technology portfolio particularly in horizontal and extended-reach wells. It was however drilling services that displayed early evidence of the opportunities provided by the acquisitions of Geoservices and Smith International that were announced during the first quarter. These successes included the completion of a remote three-well exploration project offshore Greenland that used Schlumberger technologies combined with Smith and M-I SWACO products and services as well as Geoservices mud logging. In Brazil, a similar combination of services helped one well record substantial increases in rates of penetration, while meeting all 17 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 directional drilling goals. In this particular case the integrated nature of the bottomhole assembly demonstrated how technology optimization can impact performance in the high-cost deepwater drilling environment. A third such operation offshore Indonesia further displayed the value of integrated bottomhole assemblies. WesternGeco revenue of $1.99 billion in 2010 was 6% lower than 2009 primarily as a result of lower Marine activity and weaker pricing. While Land activity was also weaker, strong Multiclient sales, particularly in the fourth quarter, were able to offset some of these effects. New seismic technology scored some significant successes with penetration of marine single-vessel, full-azimuth coil shooting surveys into a number of the major offshore basins around the world. Coil shooting, unique to Schlumberger, brings better illumination of complex pre-salt, sub-salt and sub-basalt formations in a variety of environments. The integration of Geoservices and Smith International proceeded smoothly during the year. The complementary nature of many of the product and service lines concerned helped the process while a network of integration teams and Area coordinators rapidly identified revenue and cost-synergy opportunities that contributed to results in 2010 and that augur well for 2011. Total Schlumberger 2010 results reflect four months activity from the acquired Smith businesses, which contributed revenue of $3.30 billion. In a related move, Schlumberger signed a letter of intent with Eurasia to swap certain assets in Russia to build critical mass in drilling services. Under the terms of this agreement, Eurasia will acquire a number of Schlumberger-owned drilling rigs, while Schlumberger will acquire a range of Eurasia service assets including directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling, well cementing and drilling fluids. Further, both companies agreed to enter a strategic alliance upon completion of the transaction whereby Schlumberger will become the preferred supplier of drilling services to Eurasia Drilling for up to 200 rigs for a 5-year period. This agreement not only increases the market for our services across the rig fleet of the largest Russian drilling company, it also encourages the development of fit-for-purpose bottom-hole assembly technology development as drilling intensity increases in Russia in order to sustain hydrocarbon production. Two years ago we began a program called Excellence in Execution . This was designed to create a step change in our service quality and efficiency and, in deepwater, was aimed at enabling clients to reduce the risk and cost of their deepwater operations. The program, in addition to equipment and procedural improvements, provides for competency certification of all personnel involved in deepwater operations. We have been encouraged by the initial results of this multiyear initiative, as well as by our customers acceptance of it. While additional control and oversight will undoubtedly add cost, this will be offset in the long run by improvements in operating procedures and technology. We therefore welcome current efforts to better understand and control the risks associated with deepwater operations. For 2011, economic projections for world real GDP growth are converging towards a median estimate of 4.2%, slightly lower than the 2010 level, and still with a significant level of uncertainty. A large gap exists between GDP growth rates of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries particularly in China and in other developing Asian economies. However there is remarkable agreement on various oil demand forecasts for 2011, which all lie within 1.4 million barrels per day of each other. As we look forward to 2011 it is therefore important to remember that the primary driver of our business has always been, and will remain, the demand for oil and gas. Oil prices have moved into a range that will encourage increased investment, particularly in exploration, which remains the swing factor in operators budgets. While we do not anticipate any substantial recovery in deepwater US Gulf of Mexico, we do expect a marked increase in deepwater activity in the rest of the world. These factors, coupled with increases in development activity and production enhancement in many other areas, promise stronger growth rates as the year unfolds. For natural gas, activity in the United States is likely to remain strong at least through the first half of the year due to the commitments necessary to retain leases, the backlog of wells to be completed, and the contribution of natural gas liquids to overall project economics. Increased service capacity, however, will negatively affect pricing at some stage during the year. Overseas, the governing factor on gas activity, particularly in the Middle East, will be the ability of many nations to use gas as a substitute for oil to meet increased local energy demand, thus freeing up more liquids for export. Elsewhere the long lead time necessary to execute large gas projects for LNG exports will ensure that a certain level of activity is maintained. Unconventional gas resources will continue to attract considerable interest outside North America. The leading activity will continue to be in conventional gas in tight, or low permeability, reservoirs, and in coal-bed methane 18 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 developments. There will be exploration activity around the potential that shale gas offers in many other parts of the world. Increased activity coupled with the greater technology needs of higher exploration, deepwater, and tight gas activity particularly outside North America will make 2011 a stronger year for Schlumberger. The importance of risk reduction and the minimization of drilling cost make the acquisitions of Geoservices and Smith major contributors to our future growth in this scenario. The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements . Fourth Quarter 2010 Results (Stated in millions) Fourth Quarter 2010 Third Quarter 2010 Income Income before before Revenue taxes Revenue taxes OILFIELD SERVICES North America $ 1,604 $ 385 $ 1,259 $ 219 Latin America 1,050 174 1,071 159 Europe/CIS/Africa 1,783 339 1,734 317 Middle East & Asia 1,491 434 1,402 425 Elims/Other 81 (1 ) 71 (18 ) 6,009 1,331 5,537 1,102 WESTERNGECO 560 113 478 40 M-I SWACO (1) 1,185 149 383 48 SMITH OILFIELD (1) 729 106 228 27 DISTRIBUTION (1) 576 21 199 9 9,059 1,720 6,825 1,226 Corporate (2) 8 (156 ) 20 (81 ) Interest income (3) 9 10 Interest expense (4) (58 ) (51 ) Charges & credits (5) (180 ) 836 $ 9,067 $ 1,335 $ 6,845 $ 1,940 (1) The third quarter of 2010 includes one month of post-merger activity following the Smith transaction on August 27, 2010. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. (2) Comprised principally of corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, interest on postretirement medical benefits, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded as a result of the merger with Smith and certain other nonoperating items. (3) Excludes interest income included in the segments income (fourth quarter 2010 $1 million; third quarter 2010 $2 million). (4) Excludes interest expense included in the segments income (fourth quarter 2010 - $2 million; third quarter 2010 $- million). (5) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Oilfield Services Fourth-quarter revenue of $6.01 billion increased 9% sequentially. Sequentially, North America Area revenue increased 27% on strong activity on land in the US and Canada as well as from the early payout of an IPM gain share project. In the Middle East & Asia Area, revenue grew on year-end equipment, Schlumberger Information Solutions (SIS) software sales, and on higher activity in the Iraq, East Asia and Indonesia GeoMarkets. Europe/CIS/Africa Area revenue increased from stronger activity in the North Sea, West & South Africa, Caspian and Continental Europe GeoMarkets, as well as from year-end SIS software sales. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Latin America Area revenue primarily due to continuing weakness in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket. All Technologies recorded sequential growth, most notably Well Services due to continuing strong activity in North America, and SIS and Artificial Lift from year-end sales. IPM revenue also increased as a result of the early payout on the IPM project in North America. 19 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Fourth-quarter pretax operating income of $1.33 billion increased 21% sequentially. Pretax operating margin increased 224 bps sequentially to 22.1% primarily driven by the robust performance in North America and strong contributions from the year-end equipment and software sales. North America Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.60 billion increased 27% sequentially and pretax operating income of $385 million was 75% higher. Sequentially, revenue in US land grew 24% versus a 4% increase in rig count due to a combination of additional service capacity, improved utilization, and high service intensity that mostly benefited Well Services technologies. Canada revenue grew from higher land activity for Well Services, although this was partially offset by a slowdown in offshore activity that impacted Drilling & Measurements services. The US Gulf of Mexico revenue increased through a modest improvement in shelf activity and from Completion Systems equipment sales. An $87 million early payout relating to services on an IPM gain share project triggered by the customer sale of the field also contributed to Area growth. Pretax operating margin for the Area increased 658 bps sequentially to 24.0%. This increase was largely driven by US land through stronger activity and increased efficiency for Well Services operations. The IPM gain share payout contributed approximately $55 million to Area pretax operating income. Latin America Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.05 billion decreased 2% versus the prior quarter. Pretax operating income of $174 million increased 9% compared to the third quarter of 2010. Sequentially, the Brazil GeoMarket achieved record high revenue on strong deepwater activity, while revenue in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket grew from higher gain share on IPM activity in Colombia and from Testing Services equipment sales in Peru. These increases, however, were insufficient to offset a significant revenue drop in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket where continuing security issues and client budgetary constraints further reduced IPM activity levels. Pretax operating margin improved 171 bps sequentially to 16.6% primarily due to a more favorable revenue mix in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarkets. Europe/CIS/Africa Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.78 billion increased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2010. Pretax operating income of $339 million increased 7% sequentially. Sequentially, revenue in the North Sea GeoMarket increased primarily from higher activity in Norway and from year-end SIS software sales. In the West & South Africa GeoMarket, revenue grew on stronger activity that benefited Wireline and Drilling & Measurements services and on higher Completion Systems equipment sales. Caspian GeoMarket revenue increased from the startup of several projects that resulted in higher demand for Drilling & Measurements, Testing Services and Wireline technologies as well as from a Well Services equipment sale. Continental Europe revenue grew on higher activity for Well Services and Testing Services technologies and on year-end SIS software sales. These increases, however, were partially offset by a decrease in Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket revenue from lower Completion Systems equipment sales and from delays that reduced demand for Wireline services. Russia revenue was also lower with the onset of the winter slowdown. Pretax operating margin improved sequentially by 74 bps to 19.0% primarily from a stronger mix of high-margin Wireline and Drilling & Measurements services in the North Sea and West & South Africa GeoMarkets as well as from year-end SIS software sales across much of the Area. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the activity weakness in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket. Middle East & Asia Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.49 billion increased 6% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $434 million increased 2% sequentially. 20 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Sequentially, revenue growth resulted from the continued ramp up of IPM activity in Iraq and the start of new offshore projects in East Asia. Year-end sales of Artificial Lift and Completion Systems equipment, Well Services products, and SIS software also contributed to Area growth. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue in the Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarket resulting from offshore project completions and delays in land activity due to severe flooding, and by lower activity in the Qatar GeoMarket that reduced demand for Wireline and Drilling & Measurements services. Pretax operating margin decreased 119 bps sequentially to 29.1% as the positive contribution from the year-end sales and a more favorable revenue mix in the Arabian GeoMarket were insufficient to offset the impact of the lower activity in the Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarket and startup costs in Iraq. WesternGeco Fourth-quarter revenue of $560 million increased 17% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $113 million increased 183% sequentially. Sequentially, revenue growth was driven by Multiclient, which recorded strong year-end sales from the US Gulf of Mexico. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in Marine revenue due to the seasonal slow-down in activity. Land and Data Processing revenues were flat sequentially. Pretax operating margin increased 11.8 percentage points sequentially to 20.2% as the result of the high Multiclient sales partially offset by the impact of the lower Marine activity.

(5) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Oilfield Services Full-year 2010 revenue of $22.08 billion was 8% higher than 2009. Revenue growth was strongest in the North America Area mostly as a result of higher activity and pricing for Well Services technologies in US Land but partially offset by 21 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 reduced activity in the US Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue increased on strong activity in the Brazil and Peru/Ecuador/Colombia GeoMarkets partially offset by reduced IPM activity in Mexico/Central America due to client budgetary constraints. Middle East & Asia Area revenue grew from higher drilling activity in the Australia/Papua New Guinea, China/Japan/Korea and East Asia GeoMarkets as well as from increased IPM activity and strong demand for Well Services technologies in the Middle Eastern GeoMarkets. The addition of Geoservices also contributed to the increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Europe/CIS/Africa revenue as reduced activity in the North Africa, Libya, Caspian and Continental GeoMarkets and generally lower pricing across the Area offset higher activity in Russia. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin declined 82 bps to 20.3% as a significant improvement in North America Area performance was insufficient to offset the reduced activity and weaker pricing in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area and lower IPM activity in Latin America. North America Revenue of $5.01 billion was 35% higher than last year primarily due to strong activity in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs, improved pricing in US Land for Well Services technologies and improved activity levels in oil basins in Canada. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the US Gulf of Mexico revenue as a six-month moratorium on drilling and lingering uncertainty about rules for operating resulted in the stoppage of deepwater drilling activity. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 10 percentage points to 16.0% mostly due to the stronger activity and improved pricing in the US land, partially offset by the impact of the activity slow-down in the US Gulf of Mexico. Latin America Revenue of $4.32 billion was 2% higher than the previous year. Growth was strongest in the Brazil GeoMarket where higher offshore activity increased demand for Wireline and Drilling & Measurements services technologies. Revenue also increased significantly in the Peru/Ecuador/Colombia GeoMarket due to strong IPM activity and higher Artificial Lift systems sales. The addition of Geoservices also contributed to the growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket revenue as client budgetary constraints reduced IPM activity. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 110 bps to 16.7% primarily due to the reduced activity levels in Mexico/Central America partially offset by the impact of lower costs in Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $6.88 billion was 4% lower year-on-year. This decrease was largely attributable to lower pricing across much of the Area and reduced activity in the North Africa, Libya, Caspian and Continental Europe GeoMarkets. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Russia due to higher IPM activity. The addition of Geoservices also contributed to Area revenue. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 543 bps to 18.4% primarily due to the lower overall activity levels and reduced pricing. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $5.59 billion was 7% higher than the previous year primarily due to strong drilling activity in Asia, particularly in the Australia/Papua New Guinea, China/Japan/Korea and East Asia GeoMarkets, and to increased IPM activity and strong demand for Well Services technologies in the Middle Eastern GeoMarkets. The addition of Geoservices also increased Area revenue. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 199 bps to 30.4% primarily due the impact of lower pricing across the Area. WesternGeco Full-year 2010 revenue of $1.99 billion was 6% lower than the prior year primarily due to reduced activity and pricing in Marine. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in Multiclient revenue as the result of increased acquisition and sales of wide-azimuth surveys in the US Gulf of Mexico. 22 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 194 bps to 13.4% as the result of the lower pricing and activity in Marine and reduced profitability in Land and Data Processing. These decreases were partially offset by an improvement in Multiclient margins on the increased activity. Full-Year 2009 Results (Stated in millions) 2009 2008 Income Income before before Revenue taxes Revenue taxes OILFIELD SERVICES North America $ 3,707 $ 216 $ 5,914 $ 1,371 Latin America 4,225 753 4,230 858 Europe/CIS/Africa 7,150 1,707 8,180 2,244 Middle East & Asia 5,234 1,693 5,724 2,005 Elims/Other 202 (43 ) 234 27 20,518 4,326 24,282 6,505 WESTERNGECO 2,122 326 2,838 836 Corporate (1) 62 (344 ) 43 (268 ) Interest income (2) 52 112 Interest expense (3) (188 ) (217 ) Charges & credits (4) (238 ) (116 ) $ 22,702 $ 3,934 $ 27,163 $ 6,852 (1) Comprised principally of corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, interest on postretirement medical benefits, stock-based compensation costs and certain other nonoperating items.

(4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Oilfield Services Full-year 2009 revenue of $20.52 billion declined 16% versus 2008. Lower natural gas prices and unfavorable market fundamentals resulted in a 37% decline in North America revenue, primarily in the US Land and Canada GeoMarkets. Europe/CIS/Africa revenue decreased 13% mainly due to the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar and reduced activity in the Russia, North Sea, West & South Africa and Caspian GeoMarkets as well as in Framo, which was partially offset by increased activity in the North Africa GeoMarket. Middle East & Asia revenue also fell by 9% primarily due to decreases in the East Asia, East Mediterranean, Arabian and Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarkets. Latin America revenue was only marginally lower than last year as the impact of the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar and much lower activity in Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and Peru/Colombia/Ecuador were nearly offset by stronger activity in Mexico/Central America and Brazil. Weakening of local currencies against the US dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 4%. Across the Areas, all of the Technologies recorded revenue declines except Testing Services. IPM recorded revenue growth compared to the same period last year. Full-year 2009 pretax operating margin decreased 5.7 percentage points to 21.1%, on the significant drop in activity and pricing pressure experienced across all the Areas, but most notably in North America. North America Revenue of $3.71 billion was 37% lower than last year with reductions across the entire Area. The decreases were highest in US Land and Canada, where lower natural gas prices resulted in a steep drop in activity and consequent pressure on pricing. Canada revenue was also lower as the result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar. Revenue in the US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket was severely impacted by weaker shelf drilling activity and strong pricing pressure. Pretax operating margin fell 17.3 percentage points to 5.8% due to the significant decline in activity levels across the Area, combined with the severe pricing erosion. 23 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Latin America Revenue of $4.22 billion was marginally lower compared to 2008. The weakening of local currencies against the US dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 3%. In addition, Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago revenue fell due to significantly reduced customer spending while Peru/Colombia/Ecuador revenue was lower due to reduced gain share in IPM projects. These decreases were mostly offset by higher IPM activity in Mexico/Central America and increased offshore activity in Brazil. Pretax operating margin decreased 245 bps to 17.8% primarily as the result of the sharp activity decline in Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and the lower gain share in Peru/Colombia/Ecuador. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $7.15 billion was 13% lower than last year largely due to the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar, which reduced revenue by approximately 7%. In addition, revenue was negatively impacted by reduced customer spending that resulted in significantly lower activity and pricing erosion in Russia and the North Sea. Revenue in the West & South Africa and Caspian GeoMarkets and in Framo was also negatively impacted by lower activity levels. These decreases were partially offset by a revenue increase in the North Africa GeoMarket due to strong Testing Services product sales. Pretax operating margins declined 357 bps to 23.9% on a combination of the overall lower activity and heavy pricing pressure across the Area. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $5.23 billion was 9% below 2008. Revenue was down across much of the Middle East, especially in the East Mediterranean and Arabian GeoMarkets, due to reduced demand for Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Testing Services technologies. Revenue in Asia also fell, primarily due to a decrease in offshore exploration activity, which was most significant in the East Asia and Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarkets, resulting in lower demand for Testing Services and Wireline technologies as well as Completion Systems products. Pretax operating margin decreased 268 bps to 32.4% primarily as a result of the lower overall activity and a less favorable revenue mix across the Area. WesternGeco Full-year revenue of $2.12 billion was 25% lower than 2008. Revenue decreased across all product lines, with the largest declines experienced in Marine and Multiclient. Marine revenue declined due to lower activity combined with reduced pricing as the result of weak market conditions. Multiclient revenue decreased primarily in North America, as customers continued to reduce discretionary spending. Land revenue fell on lower crew utilization, while Data Processing revenue was down reflecting lower activity primarily in Europe/Africa and in North America. Pretax margin decreased 14.1 percentage points to 15.4% primarily due to the weaker Marine activity and pricing as well as lower Multiclient sales. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ 50 $ 61 $ 119 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies: M-I SWACO 78 131 210 Others 86 78 83 Other 3 $ 214 $ 273 $ 412 24 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Interest Income The average return on investments decreased to 1.2% in 2010 from 1.4% in 2009 and the weighted average investment balance of $4.0 billion in 2010 decreased $0.5 billion compared to 2009. The average return on investments decreased to 1.4% in 2009 from 3.5% in 2008 and the weighted average investment balance of $4.5 billion in 2009 increased $1.1 billion compared to 2008. Equity in Net Earnings of Affiliated Companies Equity income from the M-I SWACO joint venture in 2010 represents eight months of equity income through the closing of the Smith transaction. The decrease in equity income relating to this joint venture from 2008 to 2009 was attributable to a significant decline in M-I SWACO activity levels, primarily in its United States and Europe/Africa regions, as well as increased pricing pressures. Interest Expense Interest expense of $207 million in 2010 decreased by $14 million compared to 2009 due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates, from 3.9% to 3.2%. The weighted average debt balance of $6.4 billion in 2010 increased $0.8 billion compared to 2009. Interest expense of $221 million in 2009 decreased by $26 million compared to 2008 primarily due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates, from 4.5% to 3.9%. Other Gross margin was 21.7%, 24.0% and 30.2% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decline in gross margin in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the acquired Smith businesses as well as pricing pressure for Oilfield Services, particularly in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area, partially offset by improved activity levels and pricing in the North America Area. The decline in gross margin in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to lower activity coupled with the impact of a significant reduction in pricing across all of Oilfield Services, most notably in North America and Europe/CIS/Africa. Weaker Marine activity and pricing and reduced Multiclient sales in WesternGeco also contributed to the margin decline. Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue , were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Research & engineering 3.3 % 3.5 % 3.0 % General & administrative 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.1 % Research & engineering expenditures were as follows: (Stated in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Oilfield Services $ 748 $ 679 $ 686 WesternGeco 103 108 118 Acquired Smith businesses 58 Other 10 15 15 $ 919 $ 802 $ 819 Income Taxes The Schlumberger effective tax rate was 17.3% in 2010, 19.6% in 2009, and 20.9% in 2008. The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase. 25 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The effective tax rate for 2010 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The effective tax rate for 2009 was also impacted by charges, but to a much lesser extent. Excluding charges and credits, the effective tax rate in 2010 was approximately 20.6% compared to 19.2% in 2009. This increase is largely attributable to the geographic mix of earnings as well as the inclusion of four months results from the merger with Smith. Smith, which as a US company has a US tax rate applicable to its worldwide operations and as such, will serve to increase Schlumberger overall effective tax rate. The decrease in the Schlumberger effective tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings. Schlumberger generated a lower proportion of its pretax earnings in North America in 2009 as compared to 2008. In addition, outside North America, various GeoMarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings in 2009 as compared to 2008. Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2010, 2009 and 2008. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The following is a summary of the 2010 charges and credits: (Stated in millions) Non- controlling Pretax Tax Interest Net Income Statement Classification Restructuring and Merger-related Charges: Severance and other $ 90 $ 13 $ $ 77 Restructuring & other Impairment relating to WesternGeco first generation Q-Land acquisition system 78 7 71 Restructuring & other Other WesternGeco-related charges 63 63 Restructuring & other Professional fees and other 107 1 106 Merger & integration Merger-related employee benefits 58 10 48 Merger & integration Inventory fair value adjustments 153 56 97 Cost of revenue Mexico restructuring 40 4 36 Restructuring & other Repurchase of bonds 60 23 37 Restructuring & other Total restructuring and merger-related charges 649 114 535 Gain on investment in M-I SWACO (1,270 ) (32) (1,238 ) Gain on Investment in M-I SWACO Impact of elimination of tax deduction related to Medicare Part D subsidy (40) 40 Taxes on income $ (621 ) $ 42 $ $ (663 ) The following is a summary of the 2009 charges: (Stated in millions) Non- controlling Pretax Tax Interest Net Income Statement Classification Workforce reductions $ 102 $ 17 $ $ 85 Restructuring & other Postretirement benefits curtailment 136 14 122 Restructuring & other $ 238 $ 31 $ $ 207 The following is a summary of the 2008 charges: (Stated in millions) Non- controlling Pretax Tax Interest Net Income Statement Classification Workforce reductions $ 74 $ 9 $ $ 65 Restructuring & other Provision for doubtful accounts 32 8 6 18 Restructuring & other Other 10 10 Interest and other income, net $ 116 $ 17 $ 6 $ 93 26 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Cash Flow Net Debt represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity.

This amount consisted of $2.2 billion of debt (including a $0.4 billion adjustment to increase Smith long-term fixed rate debt to its estimated fair value) and $0.4 billion of cash. During the second quarter of 2010, Schlumberger completed the acquisition of Geoservices for cash of $0.9 billion. Schlumberger assumed net debt of $0.1 billion in connection with this transaction. 27 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 During the third and fourth quarters of 2010, Schlumberger repurchased the following debt: (Stated in millions) Carrying Value 6.50% Notes due 2012 $ 649 6.75% Senior Notes due 2011 224 9.75% Senior Notes due 2019 212 6.00% Senior Notes due 2016 102 8.625% Senior Notes due 2014 88 $ 1,275 The premium paid in excess of the carrying value to repurchase the $1.275 billion of debt was approximately $67 million. During the first quarter of 2009, Schlumberger entered into a 3.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note program. This program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in Euro, US dollar or other currencies. Schlumberger issued 1.0 billion 2.75% Guaranteed Notes due 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2010 under this program. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 2.56%. The proceeds from these notes will be used for general corporate purposes. During the first quarter of 2009, Schlumberger issued 1.0 billion 4.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2014 under this program. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.95%. The proceeds from these notes were used to refinance existing debt obligations and for general corporate purposes. During the third quarter of 2009, Schlumberger issued $450 million of 3.00% Guaranteed Notes due 2013. The proceeds from these notes were used to refinance existing debt obligations. In September 2008, Schlumberger issued 500 million 5.25% Guaranteed Notes due 2013. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these Euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.74%. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. On April 20, 2006, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to 40 million shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before April 2010, subject to market conditions. This program was completed during the second quarter of 2008. On April 17, 2008, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock, to be acquired in the open market before December 31, 2011, of which $3.15 billion had been repurchased as of December 31, 2010. The following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs during 2010, 2009 and 2008: (Stated in thousands except per share amounts and prices) Total cost Total number Average of shares of shares price paid purchased purchased per share 2010 $ 1,716,675 26,624.8 $ 64.48 2009 $ 500,097 7,825.0 $ 63.91 2008 $ 1,818,841 21,064.7 $ 86.35 Cash flow provided by operations was $5.5 billion in 2010, $5.3 billion in 2009 and $6.9 billion in 2008. The decline in cash flow from operations in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily driven by the decrease in net 28 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 income experienced in 2009 and the significant pension plan contributions made during 2009, offset by an improvement in working capital requirements. At times in recent periods, Schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from certain of its customers. Schlumberger operates in approximately 80 countries. At December 31, 2010, only three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger accounts receivable balance of which only one, the United States, represented greater than 10%. Dividends paid during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $1.04 billion, $1.01 billion and $0.96 billion, respectively. In January 2011, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 19%, to $0.25. Capital expenditures were $2.9 billion in 2010, $2.4 billion in 2009 and $3.7 billion in 2008. Capital expenditures in 2008 reflected the record activity levels experienced in that year. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily due to the significant activity decline during 2009. Capital expenditures are expected to approach $4.0 billion for the full year 2011. During 2010, 2009 and 2008 Schlumberger made contributions of $868 million, $1.1 billion and $290 million, respectively, to its postretirement benefit plans. The US pension plans were 95% funded at December 31, 2010 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 92% funded at December 31, 2009. Schlumberger international defined benefit pension plans are a combined 92% funded at December 31, 2010 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 85% funded at December 31, 2009. Schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately $600 million to $650 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2011, subject to market and business conditions. During 2010 and 2008, certain holders of Schlumberger Limited 1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 and 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 converted their debentures into Schlumberger common stock. The following table summarizes these conversions: (Stated in millions) 2010 2008 Conversions Shares issued Conversions Shares issued 1.5% Series A debentures $ $ 353 9.76 2.125% Series B debentures 321 8.00 95 2.36 $ 321 8.00 $ 448 12.12 At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding Series A debentures. There were $321 million outstanding Series B debentures at December 31, 2009. During 2010, $320 million of the 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 were converted by holders into 8.0 million shares of Schlumberger common stock and the remaining $1 million of outstanding Series B debentures were redeemed for cash. As of December 31, 2010, Schlumberger had approximately $5.0 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $6.0 billion with commercial banks, of which $3.7 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2010. This included $4.9 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in the United States and Europe. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months. Schlumberger total outstanding debt at December 31, 2010 was $8.1 billion and included approximately $1.9 billion of commercial paper borrowings. The total outstanding debt increased approximately $2.6 billion compared to December 31, 2009. On January 10, 2011, Schlumberger issued $1.1 billion of 4.200% Senior Notes due 2021 and $500 million of 2.650% Senior Notes due 2016. 29 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Summary of Major Contractual Obligations (Stated in millions) Payment Period Contractual Obligations Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Debt (1) $ 8,112 $ 2,595 $ 1,608 $ 2,915 $ 994 Operating Leases 1,334 325 409 223 377 Purchase Obligations (2) 1,874 1,848 26 $ 11,320 $ 4,768 $ 2,043 $ 3,138 $ 1,371 (1) Excludes future payments for interest. (2) Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust its requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As discussed in Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in the Schlumberger Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010 is approximately $1.17 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumberger significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $394 million and $288 million, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-line amortized value. The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that 30 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. Certain larger surveys, which are typically prefunded by customers, are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. Inventory Reserves Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Schlumberger maintains a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This requires management to make assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory may be required. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill, Schlumberger reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco, M-I SWACO, Smith Oilfield and Distribution segments. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or applying various market multiples. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumberger estimate of the fair value of each of its reporting units comprising Oilfield Services as well as its WesternGeco reporting unit were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of their annual goodwill impairment tests for 2010. Due to the fact that the M-I SWACO, Smith Oilfield and Distribution reporting units were acquired on August 27, 2010, just prior to their annual goodwill impairment tests, the fair value of these reporting units approximated their carrying value. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period. Income Taxes Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience 31 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was 5.50% at December 31, 2010 and 6.00% at December 31, 2009. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger international pension plans was 5.47% at December 31, 2010 and 5.89% at December 31, 2009. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans decreased from 6.94% in 2009 to 6.00% in 2010. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger international pension plans was decreased from 6.81% in 2009 to 5.89% in 2010. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense. The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 8.50% in both 2010 and 2009. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was 8.00% in 2010 and 8.35% in 2009. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both the 2010 postretirement medical expense as well as the postretirement medical liability as of December 31, 2010 was 8% graded to 5% over the next six years. The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States and international pension plans: (Stated in millions) Effect on 2010 Effect on Pretax Pension Dec. 31, 2010 Change in Assumption Expense Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 18 +$ 261 25 basis point increase in discount rate -$ 17 -$ 246 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$ 13 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets -$ 13 32 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Effect on 2010 Effect on Pretax Postretirement Dec. 31, 2010 Change in Assumption Medical Expense Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 4 +$ 39 25 basis point increase in discount rate -$ 4 -$ 37 100 basis point decrease per annum in medical cost trend rate -$ 22 -$ 145 100 basis point increase per annum in medical cost trend rate +$ 26 +$ 177 33 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7A
