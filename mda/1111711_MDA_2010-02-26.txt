ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) NDC Douglas Properties owns four other properties which do not currently meet the assets held for sale criteria, as their estimated sale date is greater than one year. Based on previous impairments recorded on other NDC Douglas Properties, the properties were tested for impairment during the third quarter of 2009. The test resulted in an additional pre-tax impairment charge of $4.4 million which reduced Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2009. PEI Holdings, Inc. Whiting Clean Energy . On June 30, 2008, NiSource sold Whiting Clean Energy to BPAE for $216.7 million, which included $16.1 million in working capital. In the first quarter of 2008, NiSource began accounting for the operations of Whiting Clean Energy as discontinued operations. As such, a net loss of zero, $2.4 million, and net income of $3.7 million was included as net income or loss from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2009, reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 20-D, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2009, net revenues were $33.0 million, an increase of $5.5 million from 2008 due primarily to a higher commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues of $5.7 million, from forward physical sales contracts that are recorded at fair value. For the year ended 2008, net revenues were $27.5 million, an increase of $0.3 million from 2007. The increase was a result of higher commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues. Operating Income The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $14.5 million in 2009 compared to operating income of $2.0 million for 2008 due mainly to $22.0 million of higher operating expenses partly offset by higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses for 2009 included impairments of $16.6 million, $4.4 million and $0.7 million recorded on Lake Erie Land, three NDC Douglas Properties and the unregulated natural gas marketing business associated with programs to sell certain net assets described above. The Other Operations segment reported operating income of $2.0 million in 2008 compared to operating income of $0.5 million for 2007 due to lower operating expenses and higher net revenues described above. Operating expenses for 2008 include a gain of $0.5 million on the sale of certain land compared to losses impacting 2007. 69
