Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We primarily derive revenue from the sale of Akamai services to customers executing contracts having terms of one year or longer, which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long-term contracts. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum. Having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is important to our financial success. Accordingly, to be successful, we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services, features and functions our customers purchase. At the same time, we must ensure that our expenses do not increase at the same rate as our revenue. Accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price, quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology. See Factors Affecting Future Operating Results elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our improved financial results in 2004 as compared to 2003 and 2002 reflect our improvements in our ability to increase our monthly recurring revenue while reducing the expenses needed to support such growth. The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated: 2004 2003 2002 Revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of revenues 22 38 59 Research and development 6 8 15 Sales and marketing 27 30 45 General and administrative 22 35 68 Amortization of other intangible assets 1 8 Restructuring (benefits) charges (5 ) 31 Total cost and operating expenses 77 107 226 Income (loss) from operations 23 (7 ) (126 ) Interest income 1 1 2 Interest expense (5 ) (12 ) (13 ) Other income, net 1 Loss on early extinguishment of debt (3 ) (1 ) Gain (loss) on investments, net 1 (4 ) Income (loss) before provision for income taxes 17 (18 ) (141 ) Provision for income taxes 1 Net income (loss) 16 % (18 )% (141 )% We were profitable during the year ended December 31, 2004, the first full fiscal year during which we had net income. We have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the future: During each quarter in 2004, the dollar volume of the recurring revenue contracts that we booked exceeded the dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations, terminations and non-payment. A continuation of this trend would lead to increased revenues. During 2004, one customer, Microsoft Corporation, accounted for 10% of our total revenues. We expect to continue to do business with Microsoft; however, we do not expect that revenues from Microsoft will be more than 10% of our total revenues in 2005. As our customer base continues to grow, we expect our customer concentration levels to decline. 17 Table of Contents During 2004, revenues derived from customers located outside the United States were 19% of our total revenues. We expect that the revenue from such customers will be approximately 20% of our total revenue in 2005. During 2004, we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions in the market. In 2004, even though we delivered more traffic over our network than in previous years, overall bandwidth costs have continued to increase at a lower rate because we have reduced our network bandwidth costs per unit. We believe that our overall bandwidth costs will increase slightly as a result of expected higher traffic levels offset by continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit. If we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing and we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers, network bandwidth costs could increase in excess of our expectations in 2005. Costs associated with depreciation of our long-lived assets continued to decrease on a quarterly basis in 2004 due to these assets becoming fully depreciated. Due to purchases of new network equipment in 2004 and additional equipment purchases expected in 2005, however, we expect that deprecation of our network equipment will begin to increase in 2005. Amortization of internal-use software development costs, which we include in cost of revenues, is expected to increase slightly as we continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings. We expect a net decline in equity-based compensation costs during the first and second quarter of 2005 as equity awards issued in previous years become fully vested. The impact of new accounting guidance, SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (revised 2004), relates to the expensing of employee stock options. SFAS No. 123R will be effective during the third quarter of 2005 and will require us to record compensation expense for employee stock awards at fair value. When this requirement becomes effective, increased equity-based compensation expense will cause our net income to decrease significantly in the future because we have a significant number of employee options outstanding and expect to continue to grant additional options and other equity-based incentives in the future. As of December 31, 2004, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. However, we will continue to review the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income as we expect to continue to generate income and positive cash flows during 2005. We will continue to review our operating results to determine when it becomes more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future, at which time we would release a portion, or all, of the valuation allowance. Any reduction in our valuation allowance in the future would result in a current income tax benefit, higher stockholders equity and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods. In December 2003 and during the year ended December 31, 2004, we repurchased $243.4 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes due 2007. In December 2003 and January 2004, we issued an aggregate of $200.0 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible senior notes. By lowering our effective interest rate on outstanding debt, we believe that, in the absence of new debt, the interest expense on our debt obligations, including deferred financing amortization and capital lease interest expense, will not exceed $7.0 million in 2005. Based on our analysis of the aforementioned known trends and events, we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly basis during 2005; however, our future results will be affected by many factors identified below and in the section of this report entitled Factors Affecting Future Operating Results, including our ability to: increase our revenue by adding customers through long-term contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations; maintain the prices we charge for our services; prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks; and 18 Table of Contents maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues. As a result, there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives. Recent Events On March 16, 2005, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common and preferred stock, including vested and unvested stock options, of Speedera by issuing approximately 12 million shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $130 million based on the closing stock price of our common stock on the NASDAQ National Market on March 15, 2005. The acquisition is expected to be accounted for by us under the purchase method of accounting and is expected to close during the quarter ended June 30, 2005, subject to various regulatory approvals. The merger agreement provides for a stay of all existing litigation between Speedera and us until the closing of the merger or any earlier termination of the merger agreement. Upon the closing, all lawsuits between Speedera and us would be released. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable reserves, investments, capitalized internal-use software costs, intangible assets, income and other taxes, useful lives of property and equipment, restructuring accruals and contingent obligations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Definitions We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make highly judgemental estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and requires us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes. Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition: At the inception of a customer contract for service, we make an estimate as to that customer ability to pay for the services provided. We base our estimate on the successful completion of a credit check, financial review, the receipt of a deposit from the customer and our payment history with the customer. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. If we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all unpaid invoices to that customer and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received. Changes in our estimates and judgments of whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize. We primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum. For these 19 Table of Contents services, we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the service has been delivered to the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Should a customer usage exceed the monthly minimum, we recognize revenue for that excess in the period of the usage. We typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated. The installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement. We also derive revenue from services sold as discrete events or based solely on usage. For these services, we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the fee is fixed or determinable, the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured. We periodically enter into multi-element service arrangements. When we enter into such arrangements, each element is accounted for separately over its respective service period, provided that there is objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements. For example, objective evidence of fair value would include the price charged for the element when sold separately. If the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined, the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period. For most multi-element service arrangements to date, the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable. Therefore, all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period. We license software under perpetual and term license agreements. We apply the provisions of Statement of Position ( SOP ) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-9, Modifications of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. As prescribed by this guidance, we apply the residual method of accounting. The residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value, is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2. The difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements, if all other revenue recognition criteria of SOP 97-2 are met. We also sell our services through a reseller channel. Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller contracted non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments. We recognize revenue from fixed-fee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin ( ARB ) No. 45, Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts, and with the applicable guidance provided by SOP 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. We generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project. In certain customer arrangements, we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract. The impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change. At the outset of a fixed-fee arrangement, if we are not able to estimate the total cost-to-complete, nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones, we account for the arrangement using the completed-contract method of accounting. Under this method, we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables. In the event that the estimated total cost on a fixed-fee contract indicates a loss, we will record the loss immediately. Deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees; deferred installation and activation set-up fees; amounts billed under extended payment terms; and maintenance and support fees charged under license arrangements. Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue 20 Table of Contents recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. We record reserves against our accounts receivable balance. These reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts, cash basis customers and service credits. Increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses. The reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers where collection is no longer assured. The reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received. The reserve for service credits increases as a result of specific service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business, as well as for billing disputes. These credits result in a reduction to revenues. Decreases to the reserve are the result of actual credits being issued to customers which have a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable. Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. We perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a reserve until we receive consistent payments. We evaluate customer receivable balances and reserves on a monthly basis. In addition, we reserve a portion of revenues as a reserve for service credits. Reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued after the month of billing and an estimate for future credits. These credits typically relate to management estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Concurrent Transactions: From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology with unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies. If we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless both the fair values of our services delivered to the customer and of the vendor product or service we receive can be established objectively and realization of such value is believed to be probable. Investments: We periodically review all investments for reduction in fair value that is other-than-temporary. We consider several factors that may trigger an other-than-temporary decline in value, such as the length of time the investment value has been below carrying value and the financial results of the entity in which we invest. When we conclude that the reduction is other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations. Changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary could increase loss on investments. Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, such as fixed assets and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such a triggering event occurs, we compare the carrying amount of the long-lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations. We determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets and the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations. 21 Table of Contents Restructuring Liabilities Related to Facility Leases: When we vacate a facility subject to a non-cancelable long-term lease, we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us. In the latter case, we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income. To date, we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease, the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken, and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan. Beginning in 2003, in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, we record restructuring liabilities, discounted at the appropriate rate, for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease. As of December 31, 2004, we had $3.6 million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities. In 2003, we were able to renegotiate two of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the leases to current market rates, resulting in a reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of $9.6 million. We expect that approximately $1.4 million of the amount accrued as of December 31, 2004 will be paid within 12 months. In the event that we are able to sublease our restructured space, we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable. Loss Contingencies: We define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation. We record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote, we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Tax Reserves and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Income Taxes: We currently have significant deferred tax assets, resulting from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. We provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Management weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in past years. Despite our profitability in 2004, as of December 31, 2004, we have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. A decrease in our valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income tax benefit, an increase in total assets and stockholder equity, and could have a significant impact on earnings in future periods. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions. These potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we estimated. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs: We capitalize the salaries and payroll-related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal-use software projects. If the project is an enhancement to previously developed software, we must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software, thus 22 Table of Contents qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is complete, we must estimate the useful life of the internal-use software, and we must periodically assess whether the software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period. Results of Operations Revenues. Total revenues increased 30%, or $48.8 million, to $210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $161.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Total revenues increased 11%, or $16.3 million, to $161.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in total revenues for 2004 as compared to 2003 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of $49.4 million, partially offset by a reduction in software and software-related revenue of $477,000. The increase in total revenues for 2003 as compared to 2002 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of $28.7 million, partially offset by a reduction in software and software-related revenue of $2.8 million and related party revenue of $9.7 million. Service revenue, which consists of revenue from our content and application delivery services, increased 31%, or $49.4 million, to $206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $157.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Service revenue was $128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increases in service revenue were primarily attributable to increases in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts, as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers and in an increase in the average revenue per customer. We believe these increases are attributable to greater market acceptance of our services among new customers and improvements in our ability to sell additional features to our existing customers. As of December 31, 2004, we had 1,310 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 1,126 as of December 31, 2003, and 955 as of December 31, 2002. For 2004 and 2003, 19% and 16%, respectively, of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the United States, of which 14% and 13% of overall revenues, respectively, was derived from operations in Europe. For 2002, 13% of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the United States, of which 10% of overall revenues was derived from operations in Europe. No single country accounted for 10% or more of revenues derived outside of the United States during these periods. Resellers accounted for 27% of revenues in 2004, 25% in 2003 and 24% in 2002. For 2004 and 2003, Microsoft Corporation accounted for 10% and 15%, respectively, of total revenues. For 2002, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues. In September 2004, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with Microsoft Corporation to adjust the pricing and commitment levels. In addition, we also amended the service level agreement guarantees applicable to the various services purchased by Microsoft. The term of the agreement runs until September 2005 but may be renewed by the parties. Microsoft will have the right to reduce its commitment levels by 50% for extensions of the term of the agreement and convert the contract to a month-to-month term after September 2005 if the parties fail to reach agreement as to appropriate price and service level changes at such time. Software and software-related revenue decreased 13%, or $477,000, to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Software and software-related revenue was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Software and software-related revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered under long-term contracts. The decreases in software and software-related revenue over the periods presented reflect a reduction in the number of customized software projects performed and a decrease in the number of software and other technology licenses executed as we focused on our core services business. We do not expect software and software-related revenue to increase as a percentage of revenue in 2005. We had no revenue from related parties during 2004. Service and software revenue from related parties was $137,000 and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The reduction in revenue from related parties in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to revenue in 2002 from 23 Table of Contents Sockeye Networks, Inc., Akamai Technologies Japan KK, or Akamai Japan, and SOFTBANK Broadband Media, or SBBM, a co-investor in Akamai Japan, with no associated revenue from those parties in 2003 or 2004. Related party revenue in 2003 represents revenue from Akamai Australia, a joint venture with ES Group Ventures Pty Ltd, relating to resale commitments. In December 2002 and June 2003, the joint ventures of Akamai Japan and Akamai Australia, respectively, were terminated. In 2003, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan. We do not expect to have any revenue from related parties in 2005. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co-location of our network equipment. Cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and equity-related compensation for network operations personnel, cost of licenses, depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal-use software costs. Cost of revenues decreased 24%, or $14.7 million, to $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Cost of revenues decreased 29%, or $24.3 million, to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The total cost of revenues decrease for both periods is primarily a result of a decline in depreciation expense of network equipment as the impact of our network assets becoming fully depreciated exceeded the depreciation from the recent investments we have made in our network infrastructure. In 2004, however, a portion of this decrease in deprecation expense was offset by an increase in total bandwidth costs as a result of higher traffic delivered. Traffic delivered over our network increased significantly in 2004 as compared to 2003. Despite this increase in traffic, overall bandwidth costs have continued to increase at a lower rate because we have reduced our network bandwidth costs per unit. Cost of revenues decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 by $24.3 million primarily as a result of a reduction in depreciation of network equipment, lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management of our network traffic. Cost of revenues during 2004, 2003 and 2002 also included credits received of approximately $1.0 million, $3.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively, as a result of settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts. Credits of this nature may occur in the future as a result of our efforts to monitor and reduce our network costs; however, the timing and amount of these credits, if any, will vary. Cost of revenues is comprised of the following (in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Bandwidth, co-location and storage $ 27.7 $ 24.5 $ 32.3 Payroll and related costs of network operations personnel, including equity compensation 3.5 2.9 6.2 Cost of software licenses 1.0 0.4 0.5 Depreciation and impairment of network equipment and amortization of internal-use software 14.0 33.0 46.2 Total cost of revenues $ 46.2 $ 60.8 $ 85.2 We have long-term commitments for bandwidth usage and co-location with various networks and ISPs. For the years ending December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the minimum commitments are approximately $9.7 million, $456,000 and $41,000, respectively. We believe cost of revenues will increase in 2005 as compared to 2004. We expect that bandwidth costs will increase slightly as a result of higher expenses associated with increased traffic on our network offset by expected lower bandwidth costs per unit. Additionally, we expect increases in depreciation of our network equipment and amortization of internal-use software development costs, as well as an increase in payroll and payroll-related costs as we continue to make investments in our network. Our expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value, which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005. 24 Table of Contents Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and equity-related compensation for research and development personnel who design, develop, test and enhance our services and our network. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except certain software development costs requiring capitalization. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we capitalized software development costs of $7.5 million, $7.5 million and $6.0 million, respectively, consisting of external consulting and payroll and payroll-related costs related to the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. These capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their useful lives of two years. Research and development expenses decreased 6%, or $839,000, to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Research and development expenses decreased 40%, or $8.8 million, to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in 2004 as compared to 2003, as well as 2003 as compared to 2002, was primarily due to decreases in payroll and related costs, including equity-related compensation, as a result of the impact of workforce reductions in 2002 and reduction of equity compensation as stock awards have become fully vested. The following table quantifies the net reduction in research and development expenses over periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Research and Development Expenses 2004 to 2003 2003 to 2002 Payroll and related costs, including equity compensation $ (0.9 ) $ (7.4 ) Capitalization of internal-use software development costs and other 0.1 (1.4 ) Total decrease $ (0.8 ) $ (8.8 ) We believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2005 as compared to 2004, as we continue to increase hiring of development personnel. Our expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value, which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs, equity-related compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing, sales and service support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 17%, or $8.1 million, to $55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 27%, or $17.2 million, to $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to a rise in payroll and payroll-related costs, particularly commissions, as a result of revenue growth during 2004. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a reduction in payroll and payroll-related costs, including decreases in equity-related compensation attributable to reductions in headcount in 2002. Sales and marketing during 2003 also decreased as a result of reductions in advertising costs associated with an agreement between CNN News Group and Akamai, which expired in the fourth quarter of 2002. The following table quantifies the net increase and decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Sales and Marketing Expenses 2004 to 2003 2003 to 2002 Payroll and related costs, including equity compensation $ 5.6 $ (10.9 ) Advertising and other related costs 0.9 (7.2 ) Other 1.6 0.9 Total net increase (decrease) $ 8.1 $ (17.2 ) 25 Table of Contents We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to an expected increase in commissions as a result of higher forecasted sales, an increase in hiring of sales personnel and an expected increase in marketing costs. Our expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value, which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation of property and equipment used by us internally, payroll and related costs, including equity-related compensation and related expenses for executive, finance, business applications, network management, human resources and other administrative personnel, fees for professional services, non-income related taxes, the provision for doubtful accounts and rent and other facility-related expenditures for leased properties. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we capitalized software development costs of approximately $200,000, consisting of external consulting and payroll and payroll-related costs related to the development of internally-used software applications. General and administrative expenses decreased 18%, or $10.2 million, to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. General and administrative expenses decreased 42%, or $40.9 million, to $57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for both periods was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated, a reduction in payroll and related costs, including equity compensation, as a result of equity awards becoming fully vested and reduced rent expense as a result of the impact of restructurings that occurred in previous years. During 2004, however, consulting and advisory services increased significantly compared to 2003 as a result of the costs associated with the evaluation of our internal controls in order to allow management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The following table quantifies the net reduction in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in General and Administrative Expenses 2004 to 2003 2003 to 2002 Payroll and related costs, including equity compensation $ (8.0 ) $ (17.7 ) Rent and facilities (1.2 ) (6.2 ) Depreciation (4.7 ) (14.5 ) Consulting and advisory services 4.0 (2.2 ) Other (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Total decrease $ (10.2 ) $ (40.9 ) We expect general and administrative expenses to slightly increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to on-going litigation costs associated with trials currently scheduled to occur in 2005. If our proposed acquisition of Speedera is completed, however, we expect our litigation costs to be greatly reduced and our overall general and administrative expenses to be about the same in 2005 as compared to 2004. Our expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value, which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased 98%, or $2.2 million, to $48,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $11.9 million. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations were fully amortized as of the end of the first quarter of 2003; therefore, there was no corresponding amortization of such intangibles assets in the remainder of 2003 or in 2004. We expect to 26 Table of Contents amortize approximately $48,000 of intangible assets related to acquired license rights in 2005 and in each year thereafter through 2008, during which they will become fully amortized. Restructuring Charges (Benefits). We did not record any restructuring charges or benefits during the year ended December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded net restructuring benefits of $8.5 million as a result of amendments to certain lease agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended or terminated three long-term leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a total of $16.1 million in cash and restricted cash. As a result of amendments to, or terminations of, long-term leases, we reversed $9.6 million of previously recorded restructuring liabilities, offset by a restructuring charge of $1.1 million for costs relating to the restructuring of a facility located in Europe. The reversals represent the difference between the previously estimated restructuring liabilities and the amounts payable under negotiated agreements for certain leased properties with the landlords thereof. Beginning in 2004, our monthly rental payments have been reduced to a lower amount more aligned with current market rates. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $45.8 million, which represents $3.6 million for employee severance benefits and $42.2 million attributable to facility leases and long-lived asset impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2002, in connection with the termination of our facility leases for 500 and 600 Technology Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we recorded a restructuring charge of $8.0 million for the difference between the actual termination costs and the amount previously accrued. Also during the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $29.7 million representing the difference between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these properties. In addition, we impaired leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, deposits, deferred rent and other long-lived assets related to these facilities in the amount of $4.5 million. The following table summarizes the establishment and usage of the restructuring liabilities related to real estate leases (in millions): Restructuring Liabilities Ending balance, December 31, 2001 $ 27.6 Restructuring charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 45.8 Cash payments (32.6 ) Non cash items (3.2 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2002 37.6 Restructuring benefits net, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 (includes the reversal of $9.6 million of previously accrued restructuring liabilities) (8.5 ) Cash payments (23.8 ) Non cash items (0.1 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2003 5.2 Cash payments (1.6 ) Ending balance, December 31, 2004 $ 3.6 Current portion of accrued restructuring $ 1.4 Long-term portion of accrued restructuring $ 2.2 The restructuring liabilities will be fully paid through August 2007. We do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future; however, we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our long-term leases if we believe it to be in our and our stockholders best interests. We have estimated the 27 Table of Contents amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors. Interest Income. Interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities and interest earned on notes receivable for stock. Interest income increased 66%, or $856,000, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest income decreased 57%, or $1.7 million, to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a result of an increase in our invested short-term and long-term marketable securities balance during the course of 2004. The decrease in interest income for 2003 as compared to 2002 was the result in a decrease in our holdings of short-term and long-term marketable securities and a decrease in interest rates. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs. Interest expense decreased 44%, or $8.1 million, to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense remained relatively flat at $18.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2004 was due to lower interest expense as a result of our repurchases of a substantial portion of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes in December 2003 and at various times in 2004, offset by interest payable on our 1% convertible senior notes issued in December 2003 and January 2004. During 2004, we repurchased $169.4 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes. As a result of these transactions, we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations, including deferred financing amortization and capital lease interest expense, will not exceed $7.0 million in 2005. Other Income (Expense), net. Net other income (expense) represents foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented, as well as gains on legal settlements. Other net income of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 represents approximately $518,000 of gains on legal settlements and $543,000 of foreign exchange gains. For the year ended December 31, 2003, other net expense was $44,000 as compared to other net income of $68,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The difference between 2003 and 2002 is attributable to exchange rate fluctuations. Net other income (expense) may fluctuate in the future based upon the movement in foreign exchange rates. Loss (Gain) on Investments, net. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded a net loss on investments of $69,000 on the sale of marketable securities. During 2003, we recorded a net gain of $1.6 million, of which $1.7 million related to the sale of equity investments in publicly-traded companies, offset by losses of approximately $55,000 on investments in privately-held companies and sale of marketable securities. Loss on investments in 2002 of approximately $6.1 million included a loss of approximately $4.3 million related to our investment in Netaxs, Inc., a related party, which was realized as a result of a merger transaction between Netaxs and FASTNET Corporation in April 2002. In addition, loss on investments in 2002 included a loss of $2.4 million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments to fair value. The loss on investments was partially offset by a gain of $400,000 on the sale of our equity interest in Akamai Japan to SBBM and by approximately $149,000 of realized investment gains. We do not expect significant gain or losses on investments, as we no longer hold investments in publicly or privately-held companies. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased $4.7 million, or 223%, to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in loss on early extinguishment of debt is a result of costs incurred in connection with our repurchase of $169.4 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes during 2004. This loss of $6.8 million consists of the reduction of $2.5 million of deferred financing costs associated with repurchases of notes prior to their maturity; $2.8 million in premiums above par value paid to repurchase such notes; and $1.5 million of advisory services and offering costs incurred in connection with the repurchases. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes increased $143,000, or 23%, to $772,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $629,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Provision for 28 Table of Contents income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $492,000. The provision for income taxes during all periods presented relates to foreign income taxes which may fluctuate in the future based upon changes in foreign income. Despite our profitability in 2004, as of December 31, 2004, we have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. A decrease in our valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income tax benefit. Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions: private sales of capital stock and notes; an initial public offering of our common stock in October 1999 that provided $217.6 million after underwriters discounts and commissions; the sale in June 2000 of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes, which generated net proceeds of $290.2 million; the sale in December 2003 and January 2004 of $200 million in aggregate principal amount of our 1% convertible senior notes, which generated net proceeds of $194.1 million; and cash generated by operations. As of December 31, 2004, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $108.4 million, of which $4.6 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. See Letters of Credit below. Cash provided by operating activities increased $69.2 million, to $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to cash used in operating activities of $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Cash used in operating activities decreased $47.8 million, to $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to the increase in cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings during 2004, as well as a decrease in payments made on accrued restructuring liabilities during the period. The decrease in cash used in operating activities for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $108.0 million in net losses before non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, loss on investments, equity-related compensation and loss on early extinguishment of debt. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to remain positive as a result of an upward trend in cash collections related to higher revenue billings and a reduction in payments towards our real estate restructuring liabilities, partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays due to expected increases in headcount. However, the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities. Cash provided by investing activities was $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to cash used in investing activities of $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Cash provided by investing activities was $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cash provided by investing activities for 2004 reflects proceeds from net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of $24.1 million, offset by capital expenditures of $20.1 million, consisting of the capitalization of internal-use software development costs related to our current and future service offerings and purchase of network infrastructure equipment. During 2004, cash provided by investing activities also included a decrease of $5.0 million in restricted cash to reflect our repurchase of $5.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and a decrease of $96,000 in restricted cash previously held for security deposits. The increase in cash provided by investing activities for 2004 as compared to cash used in investing activities for 2003 was primarily due to an increase in the proceeds from net purchases, sales and maturities of investments, offset by an increase in capital expenditures in 2004. Cash used in investing activities for 2003 29 Table of Contents reflects net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of $19.3 million, an increase in restricted cash to reflect a commitment to repurchase $5.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and capital expenditures, including capitalization of internal-use software development costs of $8.9 million. Cash provided by investing activities for 2002 reflects proceeds from net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of $58.4 million less capital expenditures of $14.2 million, including capitalization of internal-use software development costs. Cash provided by investing activities during 2002 also includes a payment of $6.5 million to CNN News Group to settle an obligation resulting from our acquisition of InterVu, Inc. in April 2000. We expect total capital expenditures to be approximately 10% to 12% of revenues in 2005. Cash used in financing activities was $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to cash provided by financing activities of approximately $105.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cash used in financing activities in 2004 reflects payments for the repurchase of approximately $169.4 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of $543,000, offset by proceeds received from the issuance of our 1% convertible senior notes, net of financing costs, of $24.3 million and issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of $13.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities in 2003 reflects proceeds received from the issuance of our 1% convertible senior notes, net of financing costs, of $169.8 million, issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of $8.6 million, settlement of notes receivable for stock of $2.3 million, offset by payments for the repurchase of $74.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of $1.4 million. Cash provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans of $2.8 million and payments on our capital lease obligations of $1.6 million. Cash received from the issuance of common stock under equity compensation plans increased in 2004 as compared to prior years as a result of more option exercises in 2004. Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred revenues, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure, including debt repurchases and issuances, stock option exercises, sale of equity investments and settlements of notes receivable for stock. The following table represents the net outflow of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented (in millions): For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively $ 208.4 $ 125.2 Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Receipts from customers 206.2 162.7 Payments to vendors (91.0 ) (112.3 ) Payments for employee payroll (68.4 ) (63.7 ) Debt repurchases (169.4 ) (74.0 ) Debt proceeds 24.3 169.8 Debt interest and premium payments (18.1 ) (16.5 ) Stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan issuances 13.8 8.6 Sale of equity investments and repayment of note receivable for stock 3.4 Other 2.6 5.2 Net (decrease) increase (100.0 ) 83.2 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively $ 108.4 $ 208.4 30 Table of Contents We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $108.4 million and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures and restructuring expenses for at least the next 24 months. If the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. We may seek to retire or refinance our long-term debt with cash, equity or a combination thereof. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock, and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. See Factors Affecting Future Operating Results. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004 over the next five years and thereafter (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Less than 12 to 36 36 to 60 More than Obligations Total 12 Months Months Months 60 Months 5 1 / 2 % convertible subordinated notes $ 56.6 $ $ 56.6 $ $ 1% convertible senior notes 200.0 200.0 Interest on convertible notes outstanding assuming no early redemption or repurchases 67.3 5.1 10.2 4.0 48.0 Real estate operating leases 22.1 6.5 10.8 4.8 Bandwidth and co-location agreements 10.2 9.7 0.5 Capital leases and purchase obligations 0.2 0.2 Vendor equipment purchase obligations 0.5 0.5 Open vendor purchase orders 5.1 5.1 Total contractual obligations $ 362.0 $ 27.1 $ 78.1 $ 8.8 $ 248.0 Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2004, we had issued $4.6 million in irrevocable letters of credit in favor of third-party beneficiaries, primarily related to long-term facility leases. The letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities, of which $3.7 million are classified as long-term and $932,000 are classified as short-term on our consolidated balance sheet dated as of December 31, 2004. The restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire as provided by the letters of credit. These restrictions are expected to lapse through May 2009. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, stockholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom we license technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in the financial statements. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. 31 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (revised 2004), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period. Pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based payments is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123R is effective for all stock-based awards granted on or after July 1, 2005. We expect to adopt this standard in July 2005 under the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, a company records compensation expense for all new awards and awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the required effective date. In addition, companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date. Compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R to our consolidated results of operations but expect that the adoption will have a material impact. In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force, or the EITF, reached consensus on Issue 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share, or EITF 04-8. EITF 04-8 provides guidance on when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt securities with a market trigger should be included in diluted earnings per share, or EPS. The guidance states that these securities should be treated the same as other convertible securities and included in diluted EPS computation, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF 04-8 is effective for all periods ending after December 15, 2004 and is applied retrospectively. As a result of the adoption of EITF 04-8, our 1% convertible senior notes, convertible into 12.9 million shares, are now included in our diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended December 31, 2004, which has resulted in a reduction in diluted earnings per share of $0.01 for that period.
