The discussions in this section of this Report for fiscal 2007, as well as the financial statements contained herein, reflect the impact of the acquisition. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business and mobile software and services used by creative professionals, designers, knowledge workers, high-end consumers, OEM partners, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs, direct to end users and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers, and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on personal computers with Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non-PC platforms, depending on the product. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These accounting estimates, critical to understanding our results of operations, are as follows: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. In addition, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns, and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel 52 inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. When evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance, we analyze historical returns, current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories. Changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. In the future, actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. Our consulting revenue is recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Accordingly, our estimates of consulting revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use 53 historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the SFAS 123R disclosures. Goodwill Impairment We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax returns, primarily related to our intercompany transfer pricing. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. 54 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2007 During fiscal 2007, our software and technologies continued to redefine how people engage with ideas and information anytime, anywhere and through any medium. Our solutions drove strong revenue and earnings growth during the year. In our Creative Solutions segment, we generated strong year-over-year growth based on the release of our new Creative Suite version 3 family of products. Consisting of six new Creative Suite products and thirteen individual applications, our Creative Suite 3 product launch during the year was the largest in our 25-year history. In addition, we achieved solid growth in digital imaging and digital video hobbyist markets with the introduction of new versions of our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements products. In our Knowledge Worker segment, we achieved solid year-over-year growth based on continued adoption of our Acrobat 8 family of products. We also continued to grow our Acrobat Connect business which provides real-time collaboration capabilities via the Web utilizing our Adobe Flash Player. Our Enterprise and Developer segment also achieved solid results in 2007, generating record revenue and gaining broad market acceptance in the categories of Document Services and RIAs with our LiveCycle and Flex technologies. Our Mobile and Device business achieved strong year-over-year growth due to the ongoing success we have had targeting mobile operators, handset manufacturers and consumer electronic device manufactures with our Flash Lite and Flash Cast technologies. In our Other segments, revenue decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2006 due primarily to lower revenue associated with some of our legacy products in our Print and Classic Publishing segment. Our PostScript printing technology, a key part of our Other segment revenue, generated year-over-year growth.

As a result of our acquisition of Macromedia, we acquired purchased intangibles which will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to four years. In addition, during fiscal 2007, we 62 completed three acquisitions and acquired purchased intangibles which will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Included in the amortization of purchased intangibles for fiscal 2007, is $1.5 million related to the write-off of in-process research and development from an acquisition that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Non-operating Income Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 Investment gain (loss), net $ 7.1 (88 )% $ 61.2 * $ (1.3 ) Percentage of total revenue * 2 % * Interest and other income, net 82.5 23 % 67.2 74 % 38.6 Percentage of total revenue 3 % 3 % 2 % Total non-operating income $ 89.6 $ 128.4 $ 37.3 * Percentage is not meaningful. Investment Gain (Loss), net Investment gain (loss), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. Investment Gain (Loss), net fluctuated due to the following: 2007 2006 2005 Net gains (losses) related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $ 6.9 $ (6.5 ) $ (1.0 ) Gains from sale of equity investments 0.2 67.9 Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities (0.6 ) Gains from sale of short-term investments 0.1 Gains (losses) on stock warrants (0.2 ) 0.2 Total investment gain (loss) $ 7.1 $ 61.2 $ (1.3 ) Investment gains were higher in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2005 due to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Interest and Other Income, net The largest component of interest and other income, net is interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments, but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments, foreign exchange gains and losses, including those from hedging transactions, and interest expense. Interest and other income, net increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of higher rates of return on invested cash and short-term investments. Interest and other income, net increased during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher levels of cash and short-term investments and higher rates of return during fiscal 2006. These gains were partially offset by losses associated with our foreign currency hedging program. 63 Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 Provision $ 223.4 28 % $ 173.9 7 % $ 162.9 Percentage of total revenue 7 % 7 % 8 % Effective tax rate 24 % 26 % 21 % Our effective tax rate decreased approximately 2% during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The decrease is primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2006. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2006. A $12.3 million cumulative tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2006 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rate increased 5% during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The net increase is primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit on December 31, 2005 and because the 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit recognized in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES This data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows. Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 1,993.9 $ 2,280.9 Working capital 1,720.6 2,207.1 Stockholders' equity $ 4,650.0 $ 5,151.9 Summary of our cash flows: Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,439.3 $ 900.0 $ 758.4 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities 83.3 195.2 (348.4 ) Net cash used for financing activities (1,350.4 ) (747.4 ) (246.6 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 1.7 3.9 (1.6 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 173.9 $ 351.7 $ 161.8 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses; general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent; and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is detailed below. Cash flows from operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2007, was primarily comprised of net income, net of non-cash related expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in net income, accrued expenses, income taxes payable, deferred revenue and trade payables and decreases in trade receivables. Net changes in accrued expenses is primarily attributable to increases in accrued bonuses and accrued localization costs related to the localization of CS3 during fiscal 2007. Income taxes payable increased due to overall increased taxable income. Increases to deferred revenue relate primarily to 64 deferred maintenance and service revenue due to strong upgrade plan sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for CS3 and related point products. The decrease in accounts receivable was due to collections in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 related to high Acrobat 8 sales at the end of fiscal 2006 and strong collections during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 resulting from shipments of our CS3 family of products. We ended fiscal 2007 with days sales outstanding ("DSO") in trade receivables of 32 days. The primary working capital uses of cash were payments for accrued restructuring costs and outlays for prepaid expenses and other current assets. Accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments for facility and severance costs for fiscal 2007. See Note 9 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our restructuring charges. Net cash provided by operating activities of $900.0 million for fiscal 2006, was primarily comprised of net income, net of non-cash related expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were decreases in other current assets and increases in income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher current tax liabilities related to overall increased taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and decreases in accrued restructuring and accrued expenses. Our trade receivables increased due to increased revenue and our DSO was 48 days ending fiscal 2006. Net changes to accrued expenses was attributable primarily to decreases in compensation related costs and other expenses. Accrued restructuring decreased due to payments made during fiscal 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities of $758.4 million for fiscal 2005, was primarily comprised of net income, net of non-cash related expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Net changes to accrued expenses were attributable primarily to increases in compensation related costs and marketing expenses. Income taxes payable increased as a result of higher current tax liabilities related to repatriation of certain foreign earnings and overall increased taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations including deferrals for free upgrades associated with certain product releases. Working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and other current assets. Our accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue during the period. Our DSO was 31 days ending fiscal 2005. We discontinued our practice of paying quarterly cash dividends after payment of the dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We intend to use the cash previously used to pay the quarterly dividend for our ongoing stock repurchase programs. Cash flows from investing activities Net cash from investing activities decreased from net cash provided for fiscal 2006 of $195.2 million to net cash provided for fiscal 2007 of $83.3 million. In fiscal 2006, net cash acquired with the Macromedia acquisition amounted to $488.4 million and the sale of our minority equity investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. amounted to $82.3 million. No similar transactions of this magnitude occurred during fiscal 2007. The primary sources of cash during fiscal 2007 were sales and maturities of short-term investments offset in part by purchases of short-term investments. Uses of cash during fiscal 2007 included purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets which relate primarily to the technology licensing arrangements that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and three acquisitions completed in fiscal 2007. Additionally, as part of our lease extension for the Almaden Tower lease completed during the second fiscal quarter of 2007, we purchased a portion of the lease receivable totaling $80.4 million. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this lease extension. 65 Net cash from investing activities increased from net cash used for fiscal 2005 of $348.4 million to net cash provided for fiscal 2006 of $195.2 million primarily due to net cash acquired with the Macromedia acquisition and the sale of our minority equity investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. in fiscal 2006. These proceeds were offset in part by purchases of short-term investments, net of sales and maturities, acquisitions of property, plant and equipment, cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of long-term investments. Cash flows from financing activities Net cash used for financing activities increased $602.8 million for a total of $1.4 billion during fiscal 2007 as compared to cash used for the same period last year. Net cash used for financing activities increased $500.8 million for a total of $747.4 million during fiscal 2006 as compared to cash used of $246.6 million during fiscal 2005. Increases in both periods presented were primarily due to additional purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year. Cash used for stock repurchases increased from the respective periods presented due to a higher average cost per share, a greater number of shares being repurchased and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements. (See the following sections titled "Stock Repurchase Program I and Stock Repurchase Program II") . We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. The Board of Directors has approved a facilities expansion for our operations in India, which may include the purchase of land and buildings. As previously disclosed, we plan to invest $100.0 million directly in venture capital, of which, approximately $16.2 million has already been spent. The remaining balance will be invested over the next three to five years. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2008 in the event of a weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part II, Item 1A titled "Risk Factors". During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we also increased our existing $500.0 million credit facility to $1.0 billion. This credit facility will be used to provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes including stock repurchases. In January 2008, we drew down $450.0 million under this facility. Also, we believe that our banking relationships and good credit should afford us the opportunity to raise additional capital in the bank or public market, if required. See Notes 16 and 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our credit facility. We use professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 73% of our invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Within the U.S., the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury notes and highly rated corporate notes. The balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. As of the end of fiscal 2007, $530.8 million of the securities now classified as short-term investments have structural features that allow us to sell the securities at par within 90 days and thus retain similar liquidity characteristics as cash equivalents. All investments are made according to policies approved by the Board of Directors. 66 Stock Repurchase Program I To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. Refer to Part II, Item 5 in this Report for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 30, 2007. As part of this program, on April 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the use of an additional $1.0 billion for stock repurchases commencing upon the close of the Macromedia acquisition. This additional $1.0 billion in stock repurchases was completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") of our common stock. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at periodic intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval, and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. For fiscal 2007, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 30, 2007 are excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share. All outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of November 30, 2007 under this program will expire on or before June 19, 2008. As of November 30, 2007 approximately $422.6 million of up-front payments remained under the agreements. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22.0 million shares at an average price of $40.04 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2006. Subsequent to November 30, 2007, we entered into additional structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $150.0 million. The $150.0 million will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. See Notes 12 and 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our structured stock repurchase agreements. Stock Repurchase Program II In April 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program. Under the new program, which is not subject to expiration, we are authorized to repurchase in aggregate up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. This program is in addition to our existing stock repurchase program designed to return value to our shareholders and offset dilution from employee stock programs. During fiscal 2007, we had provided prepayments of $850.0 million under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions under this program. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 17.7 million shares through structured share repurchase agreements at an average price of $40.50 and approximately $133.7 million of up-front payments remained under these agreements. All outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of November 30, 2007 under this program will expire on or before March 18, 2008. 67 As part of this program, in November 2007, the Board of Directors approved a 30 million share increase commencing in fiscal 2008 to this Stock Repurchase Program II. This increases the authorization under this program from the original 20 million shares to 50 million shares. Subsequent to November 30, 2007, we entered into additional structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $1.0 billion. The $1.0 billion will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. See Notes 12 and 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our structured stock repurchase agreements. Summary of Stock Repurchases for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands, except average amounts) 2007 2006 2005 Board Approval Date Repurchases Under the Plan Shares Average Shares Average Shares Average December 1997 From employees (1) 39 $ 39.24 134 $ 37.10 7 $ 29.16 Open market 1,650 36.04 Structured repurchases (2) 22,012 40.04 36,792 34.00 18,708 30.61 April 2007 Structured repurchases (2) 17,684 40.50 Total shares 39,735 40.25 38,576 34.10 18,715 $ 30.61 Total cost $ 1,599,214 $ 1,315,317 $ 572,930 (1) The repurchases from employees represent shares cancelled when surrendered in lieu of cash payments for the option exercise price or withholding taxes due. (2) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. See "Stock Repurchase Program I" and "Stock Repurchase Program II" above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 30, 2007, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commitments . Lease Commitments Two of our lease agreements are subject to standard financial covenants. As of November 30, 2007, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants and we expect to remain in compliance during the next 12 months. We believe these limitations will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of November 30, 2007: Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years Total non-cancellable operating leases $ 291.1 $ 55.3 $ 78.5 $ 46.1 $ 111.2 Total purchase commitments 140.0 133.2 6.8 Total $ 431.1 $ 188.5 $ 85.3 $ 46.1 $ 111.2 68 Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Guarantees The lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others", the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. As such, we recognized $5.2 million and $3.0 million in liabilities, related to the extended East and West Towers and Almaden Tower leases, respectively. These liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the leases. As of November 30, 2007, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $4.2 million. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnership. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements.
