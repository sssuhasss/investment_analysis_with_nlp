ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) N I S OURCE I NC . Electric Operations (continued) Net Revenues Net revenues were $1,063.7 million for 2014, an increase of $41.3 million from the same period in 2013. The increase in net revenues is due primarily to higher industrial usage of $21.9 million and an increase in the return on the environmental capital investment recovery of $19.8 million due to an increased plant balance eligible for recovery. Additionally, there were increased net revenues of $5.9 million as a result of two electric transmission projects authorized by the MISO and higher off-system sales of $4.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in transmission upgrade revenue of $6.5 million included in net revenue in the prior year and the effects of weather of $5.3 million. Net revenues were $1,022.4 million for 2013, an increase of $8.6 million from the same period in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the return on the environmental capital investment recovery of $28.9 million due to an increased plant balance eligible for recovery, higher industrial, commercial and residential margins of $17.5 million, transmission upgrade revenue of $6.2 million, increased off-system sales of $4.9 million, higher revenue of $2.2 million due to an increase in commercial and residential customers and an increase in a RTO recovery mechanism of $2.1 million, which is offset in expense. These increases were partially offset by lower environmental cost trackers, which are offset in expense, of $19.5 million, decreased revenue related to emission allowances of $11.9 million, the effects of colder weather of $10.0 million, a decrease of $6.6 million related to the final reconciliation of the revenue credit recorded in 2012 and higher fuel handling costs of $4.3 million. At NIPSCO, sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and over-recovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order. These amounts are primarily reflected in the Other gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion. The adjustment to Other gross revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were a revenue decrease of $25.5 million and a revenue increase of $4.7 million, respectively. Operating Income For 2014, Electric Operations reported operating income of $282.7 million, an increase of $17.2 million from the comparable 2013 period. Operating income increased as a result of higher net revenues, as described above, partially offset by increased operating expenses. Operating expenses increased $24.1 million due primarily to higher electric generation costs of $15.2 million as a result of maintenance related outages, increased employee and administrative expenses of $9.7 million and higher materials and supplies of $3.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in tree trimming costs of $4.5 million. For 2013, Electric Operations reported operating income of $265.5 million, an increase of $14.7 million from the comparable 2012 period. Operating income increased as a result of higher net revenues, as described above, and decreased operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased $6.1 million primarily due to lower environmental trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $19.5 million and decreased electric generation costs of $13.1 million as a result of reduced outages and maintenance. These decreases were partially offset by increased employee and administrative expenses of $16.0 million, higher depreciation and amortization, excluding trackers described above, of $3.9 million, increased other taxes of $2.5 million, and higher MISO fees of $2.1 million, which are offset in revenue by a RTO recovery mechanism. 52 Table of Contents
