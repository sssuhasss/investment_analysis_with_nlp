ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana is one of the nation largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies, based on our 2008 revenues of $28.9 billion. We are a full-service benefits solutions company, offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit products for employer groups, government benefit programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 11.6 million members enrolled in our medical benefit plans, as well as approximately 6.8 million members enrolled in our specialty products. We manage our business with two segments: Government and Commercial. The Government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare, Military, and Medicaid. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of SFAS 131 , which aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing, benefits, and underwriting requirements. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other revenue, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks, in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Our results are impacted by many factors, but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium, ASO fee, and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs. Benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces, including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures, new prescription drugs and therapies, an aging population, lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking, the tort liability system, and government regulation. Our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The selling, general, and administrative expense ratio, or SG&A expense ratio, which is computed by taking total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, administrative services fees and other revenues, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency. Government Segment Our strategy and commitment to the Medicare programs has led to significant growth over the last three years. Medicare Advantage membership increased to 1,435,900 members at December 31, 2008, up 292,900 members, or 25.6% from 1,143,000 members at December 31, 2007, primarily due to sales of preferred provider organization, or PPO, and Private Fee-For-Service, PFFS, products. The acquisitions of PHP Companies, Inc. (d/b/a Cariten Healthcare), or Cariten, OSF Health Plans, Inc., or OSF, SecureHorizons, and Metcare Health Plans, Inc., or Metcare, also added 94,900 Medicare HMO and PPO members. Likewise, Medicare Advantage premium revenues have increased 23.3% to $13.8 billion for 2008 from $11.2 billion for 2007. In addition, recently the mix of sales has shifted increasingly to our network-based PPO offerings. We expect Medicare Advantage membership to increase by 25,000 to 75,000 members in 2009. Nearly 60% of our January 2009 Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in network-based products. Our PPO membership increased 57% from December 2008 to January 2009, including the voluntary move of 65,000 of our PFFS members. 34 Table of Contents We offer three Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under the Medicare Part D program: our Standard, Enhanced, and Complete products. These plans provide varying degrees of coverage. In order to offer these plans in a given year, in June of the preceding year we must submit bids to CMS for approval. During 2008, we experienced prescription drug claim expenses for our Medicare stand-alone PDPs that were higher than we had originally assumed in the bid that we submitted to CMS in June 2007. These higher claim levels for our Medicare stand-alone PDPs reflected a combination of several variances between our actuarial bid assumptions versus our experience. These variances resulted from, among other things, differences between the actuarial utilization assumptions (which are our attempts to predict members future utilization of drugs) in the bids for our Enhanced plans versus our actual claims experience in 2008, as well as an increase in the percentage of higher cost members in both our Standard and Enhanced plans. The lower stand-alone PDP operating results primarily caused the decrease in consolidated earnings during 2008 compared to 2007. We believe we have addressed these issues for 2009, based on enhancements made to our bid development and review processes. In January 2009, stand-alone PDP membership declined by 924,000 members to approximately 2,143,000, resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned stand-alone PDP premium and benefit structures to correspond with our pharmacy claims experience. The enactment of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, or the Act, in July 2008 could affect our Medicare operations. Principally, beginning in 2011 sponsors of Medicare Advantage PFFS plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. Nearly 60% of our Medicare Advantage members are already enrolled in one of our network-based plans as of January 31, 2009. We are implementing various operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to answer the challenges presented by the Act. In addition, approximately 80% of our PFFS enrollees at January 1, 2009 reside in geographies where we have developed a PPO network and offer a PPO plan. We will continue to develop our PPO network and build network-based plan offerings to address the network restriction. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those initiatives. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our quarterly Government segment earnings and operating cash flows are particularly impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member plan period which begins January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total pharmacy costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result the Government segment benefit ratio generally improves as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low-income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone PDP products, Standard, Enhanced, and Complete, affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern. Commercial Segment We continue to increase the diversification of our Commercial segment membership. Commercial segment medical membership increased 169,200 members, or 4.9% from December 31, 2007 to 3,620,800 members at December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Cariten and OSF discussed more fully below, which together added approximately 83,100 fully-insured members and 51,300 ASO members. The remaining increase primarily was due to enrollment gains in strategic areas of commercial growth. Individual membership increased 32%, Smart plans and other consumer offerings membership grew 19%, and small group membership was up 1% at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. In addition, our Commercial segment revenues grew in 2008 through expanded and new specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of CompBenefits and KMG in the fourth quarter of 2007. These acquisitions significantly increased our dental membership and added new product offerings, including vision and other voluntary employee benefits including supplemental health products such as cancer, critical illness, and accident policies. Along with our 2005 acquisition of Corphealth, Inc. (d/b/a LifeSynch), a behavioral health care 35 Table of Contents management company, these specialty acquisitions are anticipated to enhance our Commercial segment margins and our ability to appeal to more customers seeking benefit providers who offer full-service solutions. Recent Turmoil in the Financial Markets Recently, the securities and credit markets have been experiencing severe volatility and disturbance, increasing risk with respect to our financial assets. At December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents and our investment securities totaled $7.2 billion, or 55.1% of total assets, with 27.4% of the $7.2 billion invested in cash and cash equivalents. Investment securities consist primarily of debt securities of investment-grade quality with an average credit rating by S&P of AA+ at December 31, 2008 and an average duration of approximately 4.2 years. Including cash and cash equivalents, the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately 3.4 years. We had $7.6 million of mortgage-backed securities associated with Alt-A or subprime loans at December 31, 2008 and no collateralized debt obligations. Gross unrealized losses of $313.0 million at December 31, 2008 primarily were caused by an increase in interest rates from a widening of credit spreads. All issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments, and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities. After taking into account these and other factors, including severity, length of time of the decline, and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity, we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and, as such, no impairment was required. During 2008, we recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $103.1 million of which $68.7 million resulted from investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) or its subsidiaries. Lehman and certain of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008. The other impairments primarily relate to declines in values of securities, primarily associated with the financial services industry. Of the $103.1 million, $48.5 million was allocated to the Government segment and $54.6 million was allocated to the Commercial segment. We continuously review our investment portfolios. Given current market conditions, there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. In addition, during 2008 we terminated all interest-rate swap agreements outstanding associated with our senior notes based on recent changes in the credit market environment. In exchange for terminating these interest-rate swap agreements, we received cash of $93.0 million representing the fair value of the swap assets. This transaction also fixes the interest rate on our senior notes to a weighted-average rate of 6.08%. We may re-enter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors. The availability of liquidity and credit capacity in general has been impacted by the current conditions in the financial markets. We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future, as well as refinance debt as it matures. Our long-term debt, consisting primarily of senior notes, of $1,937.0 million represented 30.3% of total capitalization at December 31, 2008. The earliest maturity of our senior notes is in June 2016. We have available a 5-year, $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires in July 2011. As of December 31, 2008, there was $250 million in borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement, primarily related to funding the acquisition of Cariten described below. Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity level of statutory income and 36 Table of Contents statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. Based on the statutory financial statements as of December 31, 2008, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $3.5 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries, $1.4 billion above the aggregate $2.1 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states. Other Highlights Earnings decreased 22% to $3.83 per diluted common share in 2008 from $4.91 per diluted common share in 2007 primarily due to lower stand-alone PDP operating results, discussed previously, and other-than-temporary impairments related to our investment portfolio. Cash flows from operations decreased $242.0 million to $982.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $1,224.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease primarily resulted from decreased earnings associated with higher stand-alone PDP claims. On March 24, 2008, the Department of Defense issued its formal request for proposal for new contracts for TRICARE medical benefits nationwide. We submitted our bid in June 2008 and, after discussions with the Department of Defense, submitted our final proposal revisions in January 2009. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Recent Acquisitions On October 31, 2008 we acquired PHP Companies, Inc. (d/b/a Cariten Healthcare), or Cariten, for cash consideration of approximately $256.1 million. The Cariten acquisition increased our presence in eastern Tennessee, adding approximately 49,700 commercial fully-insured members, 21,600 commercial ASO members, and 46,900 Medicare HMO members. This acquisition also added approximately 85,700 Medicaid ASO members under a contract which expired on December 31, 2008 and was not renewed. On August 29, 2008, we acquired Metcare Health Plans, Inc., or Metcare, for cash consideration of approximately $14.9 million. The acquisition expanded our Medicare HMO membership in central Florida, adding approximately 7,300 members. On May 22, 2008, we acquired OSF Health Plans, Inc., or OSF, a managed care company serving both Medicare and commercial members in central Illinois, for cash consideration of approximately $84.0 million. This acquisition expanded our presence in Illinois, broadening our ability to serve multi-location employers with a wider range of products, including our specialty offerings. The acquisition added approximately 33,400 commercial fully-insured members, 29,700 commercial ASO members, and 14,000 Medicare HMO and PPO members. On April 30, 2008, we acquired UnitedHealth Group Las Vegas, Nevada individual SecureHorizons Medicare Advantage HMO business, or SecureHorizons, for cash consideration of approximately $185.3 million, plus subsidiary capital and surplus requirements of $40 million. The acquisition expanded our presence into the rapidly growing Las Vegas market, adding approximately 26,700 Medicare HMO members. On November 30, 2007, we acquired KMG America Corporation, or KMG, for cash consideration of $155.2 million plus the assumption of $36.1 million of long-term debt. KMG provides long-duration insurance benefits including supplemental health and life products. This acquisition added approximately 95,900 members, primarily commercial ASO. On October 1, 2007, we acquired CompBenefits Corporation, or CompBenefits, for 37 Table of Contents cash consideration of $369.6 million. CompBenefits provides dental and vision insurance benefits and added approximately 4.4 million specialty members. These acquisitions expanded our commercial product offerings allowing for significant cross-selling opportunities with our medical insurance products. On March 1, 2007, we acquired DefenseWeb Technologies, Inc., or DefenseWeb, a company responsible for delivering customized software solutions for the Department of Defense, for cash consideration of $27.5 million.

Certain of these transactions are more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Comparison of Results of Operations for 2008 and 2007 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: 2008 2007 Change Dollars Percentage (dollars in thousands) Premium revenues: Medicare Advantage $ 13,777,999 $ 11,173,417 $ 2,604,582 23.3 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 3,380,400 3,668,425 (288,025 ) (7.9 )% Total Medicare 17,158,399 14,841,842 2,316,557 15.6 % Military services 3,218,270 2,839,790 378,480 13.3 % Medicaid 591,535 555,594 35,941 6.5 % Total Government 20,968,204 18,237,226 2,730,978 15.0 % Fully-insured 6,169,403 5,663,000 506,403 8.9 % Specialty 927,237 534,121 393,116 73.6 % Total Commercial 7,096,640 6,197,121 899,519 14.5 % Total $ 28,064,844 $ 24,434,347 $ 3,630,497 14.9 % Administrative services fees: Government $ 85,868 $ 73,659 $ 12,209 16.6 % Commercial 366,011 317,856 48,155 15.1 % Total $ 451,879 $ 391,515 $ 60,364 15.4 % Income before income taxes: Government $ 785,240 $ 1,027,531 $ (242,291 ) (23.6 )% Commercial 207,608 261,769 (54,161 ) (20.7 )% Total $ 992,848 $ 1,289,300 $ (296,452 ) (23.0 )% Benefit ratios(a): Government 85.9 % 83.8 % 2.1 % Commercial 80.3 % 80.5 % (0.2 )% Total 84.5 % 83.0 % 1.5 % SG&A expense ratios(b): Government 10.6 % 11.2 % (0.6 )% Commercial 22.4 % 21.5 % 0.9 % Total 13.7 % 13.9 % (0.2 )% (a) Represents total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues.

Summary Net income was $647.2 million, or $3.83 per diluted common share, in 2008 compared to $833.7 million, or $4.91 per diluted common share, in 2007. The year-over-year decline primarily reflects lower operating earnings in our Government segment as a result of higher expenses associated with our Medicare stand-alone PDP products and lower net investment income primarily due to other-than-temporary impairments in our investment portfolios of $65.3 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased $3.7 billion, or 14.9%, to $28.1 billion for 2008, compared to $24.4 billion for 2007 primarily due to higher premium revenues in both the Government and Commercial segments. Premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Government segment premium revenues increased $2.8 billion, or 15.0%, to $21.0 billion for 2008 compared to $18.2 billion for 2007 primarily attributable to higher average Medicare Advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums partially offset by a decrease in our Medicare stand-alone PDP membership. Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Average Medicare Advantage membership increased 18.7% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales of our PPO and PFFS products drove the majority of the 292,900 increase in Medicare Advantage members since December 31, 2007. The Cariten, OSF, SecureHorizons, and Metcare acquisitions also added 94,900 Medicare HMO and PPO members. Medicare Advantage per member premiums increased 3.9% during 2008 compared to 2007. Medicare stand-alone PDP premium revenues decreased 7.9% during the 2008 period compared to the 2007 period, primarily due to a 375,400, or 10.9%, decrease in PDP membership since December 31, 2007. 39 Table of Contents Commercial segment premium revenues increased $0.9 billion, or 14.5%, to $7.1 billion for 2008 primarily due to our specialty product offerings, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and life products, as a result of the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007, as well as strategic line-of-business organic growth. Our fully-insured membership increased 9.4%, or 170,200 members, to 1,978,800 at December 31, 2008 compared to 1,808,600 at December 31, 2007. Excluding 83,100 fully-insured members added with the acquisitions of Cariten and OSF, the increase primarily was due to membership gains in Smart plans and other consumer offerings, individual, and small group product lines. We are targeting these product lines for strategic growth in this segment. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees were $451.9 million for 2008, an increase of $60.4 million, or 15.4%, from $391.5 million for 2007, primarily due to higher rates, a shift in the mix of Commercial segment membership towards higher rate groups, and the impact from acquisitions. Investment Income Investment income totaled $220.2 million for 2008, a decrease of $94.0 million from $314.2 million for 2007, primarily reflecting other-than-temporary impairments in our investment and securities lending portfolios of $103.1 million recorded during 2008. Of the $103.1 million, $48.5 million was allocated to the Government segment and $54.6 million was allocated to the Commercial segment. Excluding these realized losses, investment income increased primarily due to higher average invested balances and net realized capital gains, partially offset by lower interest rates. Higher average invested balances primarily resulted from the reinvestment of operating cash flow and the acquired investment portfolio related to the KMG acquisition. Other Revenue Other revenue totaled $209.4 million for 2008, an increase of $59.5 million from $149.9 million for 2007. The increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to Right SourceRx SM , our mail-order pharmacy. Benefit Expenses Consolidated benefit expense was $23.7 billion for 2008, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 17.0%, from $20.3 billion for 2007. The increase primarily was driven by an increase in Government segment benefit expense. The consolidated benefit ratio for 2008 was 84.5%, a 150 basis point increase from 83.0% for 2007. The increase primarily was attributable to a higher Government segment benefit ratio. The Government segment benefit expenses increased $2.7 billion, or 17.9%, during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in the average number of Medicare Advantage members. The Government segment benefit ratio for 2008 was 85.9%, a 210 basis point increase from 2007 of 83.8% primarily due to a higher Medicare stand-alone PDP benefit ratio from higher prescription drug utilization and an increase in the percentage of higher cost members in both our Standard and Enhanced plans. The Commercial segment benefit expense increased $709.4 million, or 14.2%, from 2008 to 2007. This increase primarily resulted from the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase in fully-insured membership and an increase in average per member claim costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation. The benefit ratio for the Commercial segment of 80.3% for 2008 decreased 20 basis points from the 2007 benefit ratio of 80.5% primarily reflecting an increase in average members in our specialty products from the acquisition of CompBenefits in the fourth quarter of 2007 and organic growth in our individual line of business. Individual and specialty, primarily dental and vision, accounts generally carry a lower benefit ratio and a higher SG&A expense ratio compared to larger accounts due to higher distribution costs. See related SG&A expense ratio discussion in the following section. 40 Table of Contents SG&A Expense Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $468.2 million, or 13.5%, during 2008 compared to 2007. The increases primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees due to the Medicare growth, and the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions. The number of employees increased by 3,900 to 28,900 at December 31, 2008 from 25,000 at December 31, 2007, or 15.6%. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2008 was 13.7%, decreasing 20 basis points from 13.9% for 2007 primarily due to improving administrative cost efficiency associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage and Commercial medical membership, partially offset by growth in certain of our businesses which carry a higher administrative expense load such as mail-order pharmacy, specialty products, and individual medical products. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 13% to 14% for 2009. Our Government and Commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. SG&A expenses in the Government segment increased $180.9 million, or 8.9%, during 2008 compared to 2007. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 60 basis points from 11.2% for 2007 to 10.6% for 2008. The decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average Medicare Advantage membership. The Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $287.3 million, or 20.0%, during 2008 compared to 2007. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio increased 90 basis points from 21.5% for 2007 to 22.4% for 2008. The increases primarily were due to an increase in specialty business, including the acquisition of CompBenefits and KMG in the fourth quarter of 2007, together with higher average individual product membership and increased mail-order pharmacy business. Average individual product membership increased 40.5% during 2008 compared to 2007. Specialty and individual accounts bear a higher SG&A expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2008 totaled $220.4 million compared to $184.8 million for 2007, an increase of $35.6 million, or 19.3%, reflecting higher intangible amortization expense due to acquisitions and increased capital expenditures. Interest Expense Interest expense was $80.3 million for 2008, compared to $68.9 million for 2007, an increase of $11.4 million, primarily due to higher average outstanding debt, partially offset by lower rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for 2008 of 34.8% compared to the effective tax rate of 35.3% for 2007. The decrease primarily was due to a lower combined state income tax rate and a greater proportion of tax-exempt investment income to total pretax income in 2008. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.

Summary Net income was $833.7 million, or $4.91 per diluted common share, in 2007 compared to $487.4 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, in 2006. The year-over-year increase in earnings primarily resulted from higher operating earnings in our Government segment largely due to increased premium revenue from higher average Medicare membership. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased $3.7 billion, or 17.9%, to $24.4 billion for 2007, compared to $20.7 billion for 2006 primarily due to higher premium revenues in the Government segment. Premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Government segment premium revenues increased $3.6 billion, or 24.8%, to $18.2 billion for 2007 compared to $14.6 billion for 2006 primarily attributable to higher average Medicare membership from the expanded participation in various Medicare products. Average Medicare Advantage membership increased 26.4% for 2007 compared to 2006. Sales of our PFFS products drove the majority of the 140,400 increase in ending Medicare Advantage members since December 31, 2006. Average Medicare stand-alone PDP membership increased 19.5% for 2007 compared to 2006. Commercial segment premium revenues increased $81.8 million, or 1.3%, to $6.2 billion for 2007 primarily due to our specialty product offerings, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and life products, as a result of the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions. Increases in average fully-insured per member premiums 43 Table of Contents were offset by a decrease in average fully-insured membership. Average fully-insured group membership decreased 6.9% for 2007 compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a large group account moving from fully-insured to ASO on July 1, 2006, partially offset by membership gains in strategic areas of commercial growth including Smart plans and other consumer offerings, individual, and small group product lines. Average per member premiums for our fully-insured group medical members increased approximately 5.2% from 2006 to 2007. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees were $391.5 million for 2007, an increase of $50.3 million, or 14.7%, from $341.2 million for 2006. The increase was due to increases in both our Government and Commercial segments. For the Government segment, administrative services fees increased $24.2 million, or 49.0%, to $73.7 million for 2007 as a result of the DefenseWeb acquisition and the award of a new Puerto Rico ASO contract during the fourth quarter of 2006. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $26.1 million, or 8.9%, from $291.8 million for 2006 to $317.9 million for 2007 primarily from higher average ASO membership, increasing 5.7% for 2007 compared to 2006. Investment Income Investment income totaled $314.2 million for 2007, an increase of $22.3 million from $291.9 million for 2006 primarily due to higher average investment balances in 2007 partially offset by a decrease in realized gains related to the sale of venture capital investments in 2006. Investment income for 2006 included a $51.7 million realized gain related to the sale of a venture capital investment in the first quarter. Other Revenue Other revenue totaled $149.9 million for 2007, an increase of $95.6 million from $54.3 million for 2006. The increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to Right SourceRx SM , our mail-order pharmacy. Benefit Expense Consolidated benefit expense was $20.3 billion for 2007, an increase of $2.9 billion, or 16.7%, from $17.4 billion for 2006. The increase primarily was driven by the increase in the average number of Medicare members and an increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation. The consolidated benefit ratio for 2007 was 83.0%, a 100 basis point decrease from 84.0% for 2006. The decrease primarily was attributable to improvements in the benefit ratio for both the Commercial and Government segments as described below. The Government segment benefit expenses increased $2.9 billion, or 23.0%, during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in the average number of Medicare members, including those enrolled in our PDPs, and to a lesser extent, an increase in average per member claims costs. The Government segment benefit ratio for 2007 was 83.8%, a 120 basis point decrease from 2006 of 85.0%. The decrease in the benefit ratio resulted from the combination of the extended enrollment period in 2006, improvement in the stand-alone PDP Complete plan, changes in estimates associated with our 2006 Medicare Part D reconciliation with CMS as well as the settlement of some TRICARE contractual provisions related to prior years. Part D benefit designs result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibilities for total 44 Table of Contents pharmacy costs in the early stages of a member plan period and less in the later stages, resulting in a declining benefit ratio as the year progresses. An extended enrollment period in 2006, which ended June 30, 2006, skewed the standard pattern associated with the progression of members through the stages of Medicare Part D benefits. Regarding the Complete plan, benefit design changes improved the performance of that offering. Changes in estimates associated with our 2006 Medicare Part D reconciliation with CMS and the settlement of some TRICARE contractual provisions related to the prior years decreased the benefit ratio 40 basis points for 2007. These changes in estimates resulted from 1) the resolution of first year Medicare Part D implementation matters including enrollment discrepancies; and 2) the adjustment of certain TRICARE reserves as a result of the settlement of claims payment accuracy and risk share provisions for prior option periods. The Commercial segment benefit expenses decreased $6.2 million, or 0.1%, from 2006 to 2007. This decrease primarily results from the decrease in fully-insured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs due to medical expense inflation. The benefit ratio for the Commercial segment of 80.5% for 2007 decreased 120 basis points from the 2006 benefit ratio of 81.7%. The decrease in the benefit ratio primarily reflects an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our total fully-insured block, the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions which added dental, vision, and other supplemental health and life members, and improving medical cost utilization. Individual and smaller group as well as specialty, primarily dental and vision, accounts generally carry a lower benefit ratio and a higher SG&A expense ratio compared to larger accounts due to higher distribution costs. See related SG&A expense ratio discussion in the following section. SG&A Expense Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $455.0 million, or 15.1%, during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees due to the Medicare expansion, expenses associated with Right SourceRx SM , our mail-order pharmacy, and higher Medicare marketing expenses associated with higher sales goals for 2008 compared to 2007. The number of employees increased by 2,700 to 25,000 at December 31, 2007 from 22,300 at December 31, 2006, or 12.1%. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2007 was 13.9%, decreasing 40 basis points from 14.3% for 2006. The SG&A expense ratio decrease resulted from improving administrative cost efficiency associated with servicing our members offset by our expanding mail-order pharmacy business as well as differences in the composition of our medical membership portfolio for 2007 versus 2006. Our Government and Commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. SG&A expenses in the Government segment increased $312.0 million, or 18.0%, during 2007 compared to 2006. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 60 basis points from 11.8% for 2006 to 11.2% for 2007. The decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average Medicare membership. The Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $143.0 million, or 11.1%, during 2007 compared to 2006. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio increased 150 basis points from 20.0% for 2006 to 21.5% for 2007. This increase primarily resulted from the continued shift in the mix of membership towards ASO, an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our fully-insured membership, and administrative costs associated with increased business for our mail-order pharmacy. For 2007, 46.8% of our Commercial segment average medical membership was related to ASO business compared to 44.5% for 2006. Likewise, at December 31, 2007, 29.3% of our Commercial segment average medical membership was related to individual and small group accounts compared to 27.7% at December 31, 2006. Fee based ASO business carries 45 Table of Contents a higher SG&A expense ratio than fully-insured business since there is no benefit expense or offsetting premium revenue. Additionally, individual and smaller group accounts bear a higher SG&A expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2007 totaled $184.8 million compared to $148.6 million for 2006, an increase of $36.2 million, or 24.4%. The increase primarily resulted from increased capital expenditures related to the Medicare expansion. Interest Expense Interest expense was $68.9 million for 2007, compared to $63.1 million for 2006, an increase of $5.8 million, primarily due to higher average outstanding debt partially offset by lower interest rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for 2007 of 35.3% compared to the effective tax rate of 36.0% for 2006. The decrease is primarily due to a lower state tax rate. The lower state tax rate resulted from a shift in the geographic mix of revenues to states with lower tax rates. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. Liquidity Our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums, ASO fees, and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments, SG&A expenses, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and repayments on borrowings. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. The use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $1,970.4 million at December 31, 2008 from $2,040.5 million at December 31, 2007. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is summarized as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 982,310 $ 1,224,262 $ 1,686,712 Net cash used in investing activities (498,324 ) (1,845,391 ) (1,654,066 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (554,016 ) 921,278 975,642 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (70,030 ) $ 300,149 $ 1,008,288 Cash Flow from Operating Activities The decrease in operating cash flows for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily resulted from decreased earnings associated with higher stand-alone PDP claims. The decrease in operating cash flows for 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from the timing of cash flows associated with our Medicare Part D offerings, offset by Medicare enrollment growth and improved earnings. During 2007, we paid $725.5 million to CMS under the risk corridor terms of our 2006 contracts with CMS. 46 Table of Contents Comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and ASO fees and payments of benefit expenses. We illustrate these changes with the following summaries of receivables and benefits payable. The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: 2008 2007 2006 Change 2008 2007 (in thousands) Military services: Base receivable $ 436,009 $ 404,570 $ 452,509 $ 31,439 $ (47,939 ) Change orders 6,190 5,168 4,247 1,022 921 Military services subtotal 442,199 409,738 456,756 32,461 (47,018 ) Medicare 232,608 137,345 143,875 95,263 (6,530 ) Commercial and other 164,035 126,718 125,899 37,317 819 Allowance for doubtful accounts (49,160 ) (68,260 ) (45,589 ) 19,100 (22,671 ) Total net receivables $ 789,682 $ 605,541 $ 680,941 184,141 (75,400 ) Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Provision for doubtful accounts 5,398 28,922 Receivables from acquisition (36,646 ) (14,267 ) Change in receivables per cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations $ 152,893 $ (60,745 ) Military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees. The claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period. The timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the increase in base receivables from 2007 to 2008 compared to a decrease from 2006 to 2007. The changes in Medicare receivables over the last three years have been impacted by the growth in our Medicare business and the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model. The $37.3 million increase in Commercial and other receivables from 2007 to 2008 primarily was the result of an increase in Puerto Rico Medicaid receivables, which were collected in January 2009. The detail of benefits payable was as follows at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 (in thousands) IBNR(1) $ 1,851,047 $ 1,695,088 $ 1,538,057 $ 155,959 $ 157,031 Military services benefits payable(2) 306,797 341,372 430,674 (34,575 ) (89,302 ) Reported claims in process(3) 486,514 253,054 165,254 233,460 87,800 Other benefits payable(4) 561,221 407,319 276,422 153,902 130,897 Total benefits payable $ 3,205,579 $ 2,696,833 $ 2,410,407 508,746 286,426 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Benefits payable from acquisition (96,021 ) (41,029 ) Change in benefits payable in cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations $ 412,725 $ 245,397 47 Table of Contents (1) IBNR represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR). (2) Military services benefits payable primarily results from the timing of the cost of providing health care services to beneficiaries and the related reimbursement by the federal government as more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A corresponding receivable is included in the base receivable in the previous receivables table. (3) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff. (4) Other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements. The increase in benefits payable during 2008 and 2007 primarily was due to the increase in IBNR from growth in Medicare Advantage members and, to a lesser extent, benefit claims inflation, an increase in the amount of processed but unpaid claims including pharmacy claims which fluctuate due to month-end cutoff, and an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements from Medicare Advantage membership growth. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $422.9 million in 2008 and $493.5 million in 2007 primarily related to the SecureHorizons, OSF, and Cariten acquisitions in 2008 and the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions in 2007. We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities, primarily fixed income securities, totaling $685.5 million in 2008, $430.1 million in 2007, and $862.1 million in 2006. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review, and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $261.6 million in 2008, $239.2 million in 2007, and $193.2 million in 2006. Excluding acquisitions, we expect total capital expenditures in 2009 of approximately $260 million. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During 2008, the net repayment of $550 million under our credit agreement primarily related to amounts repaid from the issuance of $750 million in senior notes offset by the $250 million financing of the Cariten acquisition. Net borrowings of $350 million under our credit agreement during 2007 primarily related to the financing of the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions. During 2006, net borrowings of $250 million primarily related to the funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries in conjunction with growth in Medicare revenues, offset by amounts repaid from the issuance of senior notes. During 2008, we issued $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018 and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038. Our net proceeds, reduced for the original issue discount and cost of the offering, were $742.6 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement. During 2006, we issued $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016. Our net proceeds, reduced for the original issue discount and cost of the offering, were $494.3 million. We used the proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement, which at the time of the issuance was $200 million, and the repayment of our $300 million 7.25% senior notes which matured on August 1, 2006. 48 Table of Contents Receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were $188.7 million higher than claims payments during 2008 and $185.1 million less than the corresponding claim payments during 2007. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further description. In exchange for terminating interest-rate swap agreements in 2008, we received cash of $93.0 million. The remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2008, 2007, and 2006 primarily resulted from the change in the securities lending payable, common stock repurchases, the excess tax benefit from stock compensation, and proceeds from stock option exercises. The decrease in securities lending in 2008 resulted from the tightening of the credit markets while the increase in 2007 and 2006 coincides with higher average balances of investments to lend. During 2008, we repurchased 2.1 million common shares for $92.8 million under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors. We also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of $13.3 million in 2008, $27.4 million in 2007, and $26.2 million in 2006. Future Sources and Uses of Liquidity Stock Repurchase Plan On February 22, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150 million of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 2.1 million shares in open market transactions for $92.8 million at an average price of $44.19. On July 28, 2008 (announced August 4, 2008), the Board of Directors increased the authorized amount to $250 million, excluding the $92.8 million used prior to that time in connection with the initial February 2008 authorization. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchases, or in privately-negotiated transactions, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. Due to continued volatility and turmoil in the financial markets, we have not yet repurchased any shares under the July 2008 authorization. The presently-authorized share repurchase program expires on December 31, 2009. Senior Notes During 2008, we issued $500 million of 7.20% senior notes due June 15, 2018 and $250 million of 8.15% senior notes due June 15, 2038. The 7.20% and 8.15% senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded (or subsequently upgraded) and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances. We also previously issued $300 million of 6.30% senior notes due August 1, 2018 and $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016. All four series of our senior notes, which are unsecured, may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified make-whole amount. Concurrent with the senior notes issuances, we entered into interest-rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. During 2008, we terminated all of our swap agreements. We may re-enter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors. Our senior notes and related swap agreements are more fully discussed in Notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Credit Agreement Our 5-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement expires in July 2011. Under the credit agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a revolving credit basis or a competitive advance basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, currently 35 basis points, varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 27 to 80 basis points. We 49 Table of Contents also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 10 basis points, may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. In addition, a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for each day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50% of the total $1.0 billion commitment. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on LIBOR, at our option. The terms of the credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse event clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of $2,868.1 million at December 31, 2008 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0:1. We are in compliance with the financial covenants, with actual net worth of $4,457.2 million and a leverage ratio of 1.4:1, as measured in accordance with the credit agreement as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, we had $250 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at an interest rate, which varies with LIBOR, of 0.98%. In addition, we have outstanding letters of credit of $3.1 million secured under the credit agreement. No amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2008, we had $746.9 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement, none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement. We have other customary, arms-length relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some parties to the credit agreement. Other Long-Term Borrowings Other long-term borrowings of $38.1 million at December 31, 2008 represent junior subordinated debt assumed in the 2007 KMG acquisition of $36.1 million and financing for the renovation of a building of $2.0 million. The junior subordinated debt, which is due in 2037, may be called by us in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 8.02% payable quarterly until 2012, and then payable at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 310 basis points. The debt associated with the building renovation bears interest at 2.00%, is collateralized by the building, and is payable in various installments through 2014. Liquidity Requirements We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future, and to refinance debt as it matures. See the section entitled Risk Factors in this report. Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2008 was BBB according to Standard & Poor Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa3 according to Moody Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s. A downgrade by S&P to BB+ or by Moody to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $750 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points up to a maximum 100 basis points. In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the parent company decreased $285.2 million to $250.5 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $535.7 million at December 31, 2007, primarily due to cash consideration paid for our 2008 acquisitions. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. Subject to appropriate regulatory approval, we expect to dividend approximately $500 million from our subsidiaries to the parent during 2009 compared to $296.0 million in 2008. In addition, we expect capital contributions to our subsidiaries to be less than the $242.8 million contributed in 2008. 50 Table of Contents Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Based on the statutory financial statements as of December 31, 2008, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $3.5 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries, $1.4 billion above the aggregate $2.1 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states. Contractual Obligations We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2008 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Debt $ 1,838,068 $ 540 $ 250,987 $ 333 $ 1,586,208 Interest(1) 1,433,818 114,289 226,762 218,583 874,184 Operating leases(2) 548,231 143,446 230,215 104,741 69,829 Purchase obligations(3) 148,609 52,142 68,935 24,293 3,239 Future policy benefits payable and other long-term liabilities(4) 932,747 37,673 105,003 98,090 691,981 Total $ 4,901,473 $ 348,090 $ 881,902 $ 446,040 $ 3,225,441 (1) Interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements. (2) We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2019. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease, accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases , is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased such asset, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (4) Excludes future policy benefits payable ceded to third parties through a 100% coinsurance agreement as more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The reinsurance carrier, not us, is responsible for cash flows associated with the reinsured contract. Our reinsured reserves are supported by reinsurance recoverables included in other long-term assets. Our potential liability is limited to the credit exposure which exists should the reinsurer be unable to meet its obligations assumed under these reinsurance arrangements. We evaluate the financial condition of these reinsurers on a regular basis. 51 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we are not involved in any SPE transactions. Guarantees and Indemnifications Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held April 23, 2009 see Certain Transactions with Management and Others. Government Contracts Our Medicare business, which accounted for approximately 60% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily consisted of products covered under the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan contracts with the federal government. These contracts are renewed generally for a one-year term each December 31 unless CMS notifies Humana of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the year in which the contract would end, or Humana notifies CMS of its decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare business have been renewed for 2009. CMS has announced that it will perform audits of selected Medicare Advantage plans each year to validate the provider coding practices under the risk-adjustment model used to reimburse Medicare Advantage plans. These audits will involve a comprehensive review of medical records, and may result in contract-level payment adjustments to premium payments made to a health plan pursuant to its Medicare contract with CMS or other payment reductions. The first data validation audits will focus on risk-adjustment data for 2006 used to determine 2007 payment amounts. Several Humana contracts are included in audits being undertaken by CMS. If necessary, based on audit results, CMS may make contract-level payment adjustments that may occur during 2009, and adjustments may occur prior to Humana or other Medicare Advantage plans having the opportunity to appeal audit findings. We primarily rely on providers to appropriately document risk-adjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions, which we send to CMS as the basis for our risk-adjustment model premium. We are working with CMS and our industry group to develop an orderly audit process, for which CMS 52 Table of Contents has not yet indicated the complete details. Therefore, we are unable to predict the complete audit methodology to be used by CMS, the outcome of these audits, or whether these audits would result in a payment adjustment. However, it is reasonably possible that a payment adjustment as a result of these audits could occur, and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our military services business, which accounted for approximately 12% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily consisted of the TRICARE South Region contract. The 5-year South Region contract, which expires March 31, 2009, was subject to annual renewals on April 1 of each year at the government option. On January 16, 2009, we entered into an Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract to the TRICARE South Region contract. The Amendment added one additional one-year option period, the sixth option period, which runs from April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010, and two additional six-month option periods: the seventh option period runs from April 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010 and the eighth option period runs from October 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011. Exercise of each of the sixth, seventh, and eighth option periods is at the government option. Under these extensions, government requirements, terms and conditions will remain the same as the current contract. On January 22, 2009, we were notified by the government of its intent to exercise its option to extend the TRICARE contract for the sixth option period. As required under the contract, the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for each option period are negotiated. Any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on us. These changes may include, for example, an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. On March 24, 2008, the Department of Defense issued its formal request for proposal for new contracts for TRICARE medical benefits nationwide. We submitted our bid in June 2008 and, after discussions with the Department of Defense, submitted our final proposal revisions in January 2009. If we are not awarded a new TRICARE contract, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our Medicaid business, which accounted for approximately 2% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisted of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida, with the vast majority in Puerto Rico. In August 2008, we renewed our Medicaid contracts with the Puerto Rico Insurance Administration for the East and Southeast regions. These contracts expire on June 30, 2009. We also provide services under a three-year ASO contract with the Puerto Rico Health Administration for the Metro North Region. The Puerto Rico Health Administration did not renew the third year of the ASO contract and the contract expired September 30, 2008. The loss of this contract did not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The loss of any of the contracts above (exclusive of the three-year Puerto Rico ASO contract) or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts 53 Table of Contents reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefit expenses and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Benefit Expense Recognition Benefit expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows: December 31, 2008 Percentage of Total December 31, 2007 Percentage of Total (dollars in thousands) IBNR $ 1,851,047 57.7 % $ 1,695,088 62.8 % Reported claims in process 486,514 15.2 % 253,054 9.4 % Other benefits payable 561,221 17.5 % 407,319 15.1 % Benefits payable, excluding military services 2,898,782 90.4 % 2,355,461 87.3 % Military services benefits payable 306,797 9.6 % 341,372 12.7 % Total benefits payable $ 3,205,579 100.0 % $ 2,696,833 100.0 % Military services benefits payable primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government as more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This amount is generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government, as more fully-described on page 47. Estimating IBNR is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in this estimate can materially affect, either favorably or unfavorably, our results of operations and overall financial position. Accordingly, it represents a critical accounting estimate. Most benefit claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider. As a result, these liabilities generally are described as having a short-tail . As such, we expect that substantially all of the December 31, 2008 estimate of benefits payable will be known and paid during 2009. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate. Therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. We develop our estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim experience. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent three months, the key assumption used in estimating our IBNR is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12-month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes. Completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a 54 Table of Contents given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period. For the most recent three months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, changes in member cost sharing, product mix, and weekday seasonality. The completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result. Conversely, for the most recent three months of incurred claims, the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result, which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation. Changes in claim processes, including receipt cycle times, claim inventory levels, recoveries of overpayments, outsourcing, system conversions, and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors. The receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received. Increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last few years. For example, the average receipt cycle time has decreased from 15.9 days in 2006 to 15.0 days in 2008 which represents a 6.0% reduction in cycle time over the three year period. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claim may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using our completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. The drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities, physician services, prescription drugs, and new medical technologies, as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, increases in medical services capacity, direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services, an aging population, catastrophes, and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends. Internal factors such as system conversions, claims processing cycle times, changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. All of these factors are considered in estimating IBNR and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Additionally, we continually prepare and review follow-up studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time. The results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management. The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2008 data: Completion Factor (a): Claims Trend Factor (b): Factor Change (c) Increase (Decrease) in Benefits Payable Factor Change (c) (Decrease) Increase in Benefits Payable (dollars in thousands) 1.50% $ (183,100 ) (7 )% $ (300,200 ) 1.00% $ (122,100 ) (5 )% $ (214,400 ) 0.50% $ (61,000 ) (4 )% $ (171,500 ) 0.25% $ (30,500 ) (3 )% $ (128,600 ) (0.50)% $ 61,000 (1 )% $ (42,900 ) (1.00)% $ 122,100 1 % $ 42,900 55 Table of Contents (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent three months. (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent three months. (c) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. The following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable, excluding military services. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefit expenses as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) Balances at January 1 $ 2,355,461 $ 1,979,733 $ 1,334,716 Acquisitions 96,021 41,029 21,198 Incurred related to: Current year 21,092,135 18,015,247 15,374,855 Prior years (268,027 ) (242,922 ) (178,998 ) Total incurred 20,824,108 17,772,325 15,195,857 Paid related to: Current year (18,832,301 ) (16,012,828 ) (13,532,139 ) Prior years (1,544,507 ) (1,424,798 ) (1,039,899 ) Total paid (20,376,808 ) (17,437,626 ) (14,572,038 ) Balances at December 31 $ 2,898,782 $ 2,355,461 $ 1,979,733 The following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions. As previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. The amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefit expenses ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments. Favorable Development by Changes in Key Assumptions 2008 2007 2006 Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) (dollars in thousands) Trend factors $ (175,268 ) (5.2 )% $ (124,957 ) (4.3 )% $ (136,457 ) (6.4 )% Completion factors (92,759 ) 1.0 % (63,985 ) 0.8 % (42,541 ) 0.7 % Medicare Part D reconciliation n/a (53,980 ) n/a n/a Total $ (268,027 ) $ (242,922 ) $ (178,998 ) (a) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. As summarized in the table above, the majority of the favorable development resulted from trend factors for the most recent three months ultimately being lower than originally estimated for each of the years presented. Several factors drove the actual trend factors lower than the originally estimated trends: Utilization of hospital and physician services ultimately was lower than our original estimates for both our Commercial and Medicare lines of business. Rapid growth in our Medicare private fee-for-service product in new geographic areas resulted in more limited historical information from which to base trend rate estimates. 56 Table of Contents Hurricanes in Florida and Louisiana during the second half of 2005 ultimately resulted in the utilization of health care services being less than historical trend levels for the last several months of 2005, particularly in our Commercial business in the affected areas. This resulted in a larger trend factor variance in 2006 versus the other years presented. Additionally, actual completion factors ultimately were higher than our original completion factors used to establish reserves at December 31, 2007 and 2006, which were based upon historical patterns. This increase in completion factor percentage primarily resulted from a shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim submissions and changes in claim payment and recovery patterns associated with outsourcing claims processing functions for our Medicare private fee-for-service product. Finally, first-year Medicare Part D enrollment and eligibility issues during 2006 led to actual claim settlements with other health plans and various state governments during 2007 for amounts less than originally estimated. Similar adjustments in 2008 were not significant due to a lower volume of new enrollees and improvements in the program enrollment process in 2007. We have adjusted for the favorable historical trend and completion factor experience together with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves at December 31, 2008. However, based on our historical experience, it is reasonably likely that our actual trend and completion factors may vary from the factors used in our December 31, 2008 estimates. Any variances are expected to be within the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity analysis table. Benefit expenses associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) Military services $ 2,819,787 $ 2,481,814 $ 2,208,033 Future policy benefits 64,338 16,392 17,314 Total $ 2,884,125 $ 2,498,206 $ 2,225,347 Our TRICARE contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk of financing health benefits. The federal government both reimburses us for our cost of providing health benefits and bears responsibility for 80% of any variance from the annual target health care cost and actual health care cost as more fully described beginning on page 60. Therefore, the impact on our income from operations from changes in estimate for TRICARE benefits payable is reduced substantially by corresponding adjustments to revenues. The net increase (decrease) to income from operations as determined retrospectively, after giving consideration to claim development occurring in the current period, was approximately $(13.7) million for 2007 and $1.1 million for 2006. The impact from changes in estimates for 2008 is not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2009 will change as our December 31, 2008 benefits payable estimate develops throughout 2009. Future policy benefits payable of $1,164.8 million and $980.7 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, represent liabilities for long-duration insurance policies including life insurance, annuities, health, and long-term care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. These reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon actual experience. The basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our experience deteriorates to the point the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits. Future policy benefits payable include $503.2 million at December 31, 2008 and $307.5 million at December 31, 2007 57 Table of Contents associated with a closed block of long-term care policies acquired in connection with the November 30, 2007 KMG acquisition. Long-term care policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established. The risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of long-term care policies. We monitor the loss experience of these long-term care policies and, when necessary, apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold. We expect to file premium rate increases in 2009. To the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions, future adjustments to reserves could be required. In addition, future policy benefits payable include amounts of $232.0 million at December 31, 2008 and $239.7 million at December 31, 2007 which are subject to 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other long-term assets. As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. An increase in the absolute dollar amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has resulted from the growth in our Medicare business, coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member. However, our Medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section. Premium revenues and ASO fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. In addition, we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay. Enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group, an individual, or the government, also known as retroactive membership adjustments, are estimated based on available data and historical trends. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in the current period revenue. We bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and members in our Medicare and individual products monthly. We receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified reimbursement rates and various contractual terms. Changes in revenues from CMS for our Medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Medicare Part D Provisions On January 1, 2006, we began covering prescription drug benefits in accordance with Medicare Part D under multiple contracts with CMS. The payments we receive monthly from CMS and members, which are determined from our annual bid, represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage. We recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract. 58 Table of Contents Our CMS payment is subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. In addition, we receive and disburse amounts for portions of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk, as described more fully below. The risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience. We record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or long-term in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected settlement. The estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain, including, among others, member eligibility differences with CMS. In 2008, we paid $78.7 million related to our reconciliation with CMS regarding the 2007 Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of $102.6 million at December 31, 2007. In 2007, we paid $725.5 million related to our reconciliation with CMS regarding the 2006 Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of $738.7 million at December 31, 2006. 2006 marked the first year of providing for the risk corridor estimate and required us to consider factors which were not certain, including certain first year implementation issues. The net asset associated with the 2008 risk corridor estimate, which will be settled in 2009, was $55.4 million at December 31, 2008. Reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for CMS portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and related settlement of CMS prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year. We account for these subsidies as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We do not recognize premium revenues or benefit expense for these subsidies. Receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period. Gross financing receipts were $2,761.3 million and gross financing withdrawals were $2,572.6 million during 2008. CMS subsidy activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008 was $322.1 million to other current assets and $219.7 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses. In order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage, CMS provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage, or coverage beyond CMS defined standard benefits. The demonstration payment option is an arrangement in which CMS pays a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the government portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage. The capitation amount represents a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer. We chose the demonstration payment option for all of our enhanced benefit plans for 2006 through 2008, but not for 2009. This capitation amount, derived from our annual bid submissions, is recorded as premium revenue. The variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer is subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. This reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for CMS to administer the program. 59 Table of Contents Medicare Risk-Adjustment Provisions CMS has implemented a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity. The CMS risk-adjustment model pays more for members with predictably higher costs, as more fully described in Item 1. Business beginning on page 5. Under this risk-adjustment methodology, diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us. We primarily rely on providers to appropriately document risk-adjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions, which we send to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk-adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to CMS and ultimately accepted by CMS. We do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our stand-alone PDP members. Military services In 2008, military services revenues represented 12% of total premiums and administrative services fees. Military services revenue primarily is derived from our TRICARE South Region contract with the Department of Defense and in addition, beginning January 1, 2008, from our contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Revenues associated with our contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs are recognized in the period services are performed. The single TRICARE contract for the South Region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables . We allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components. TRICARE revenues consist generally of (1) an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries; (2) health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government; and (3) administrative services fees related to claim processing, customer service, enrollment, disease management and other services. We recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided. Health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided. Administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed. The TRICARE contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits. Annually, we negotiate a target health care cost amount, or target cost, with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee. Any variance from the target cost is shared. We earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost. We receive 20% for any cost underrun, subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10% of the target cost. We pay 20% for any cost overrun, subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4% of the target cost. A final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies. We defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. We estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefit expenses. We continually review these benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. The military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders. Change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract. Under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations. Change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. 60 Table of Contents Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $5,215.4 million, or 40% of total assets at December 31, 2008, and $4,650.4 million, or 36% of total assets at December 31, 2007. Debt securities, detailed below, comprised over 99% of this investment portfolio. The fair value of debt securities were as follows at December 31, 2008 and 2007: December 31, 2008 Percentage of Total December 31, 2007 Percentage of Total (dollars in thousands) U.S. Government and agency obligations $ 1,883,378 36.2 % $ 984,003 21.2 % Tax exempt municipal securities 1,689,462 32.5 % 1,864,991 40.2 % Mortgage and asset-backed securities 766,202 14.7 % 910,662 19.6 % Corporate securities 841,397 16.2 % 863,866 18.6 % Redeemable preferred stocks 19,702 0.4 % 15,558 0.4 % Total debt securities $ 5,200,141 100.0 % $ 4,639,080 100.0 % More than 98% of our debt securities were of investment-grade quality, with an average credit rating of AA+ by S&P at December 31, 2008. Most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end (BB or better) of the non-investment grade spectrum. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. U.S. Government and agency obligations include $1,431.6 million at December 31, 2008 and $791.8 million at December 31, 2007 of debt securities issued by agencies of the U.S. Government including Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association, or Freddie Mac, whose principal payment is guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Tax exempt municipal securities included pre-refunded bonds of $694.8 million at December 31, 2008 and $182.2 million at December 31, 2007. These pre-refunded bonds are secured by an escrow fund consisting of U.S. government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity. The ratings of these pre-refunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations (AAA by S&P) at the time the fund is established. In addition, certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our tax exempt municipal securities. We have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers. We owned $452.4 million and $662.4 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively of tax exempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers. The equivalent S&P credit rating of these tax-exempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was AA-. Our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities backed by home equity loans. The fair value of securities backed by Alt-A and subprime loans was $7.6 million at December 31, 2008 and $22.0 million at December 31, 2007. There are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio. The percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 42.4% at December 31, 2008 and 48.4% at December 31, 2007. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 4.2 years at December 31, 2008. Including cash equivalents, the average duration was approximately 3.4 years. Based on the duration including cash equivalents, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately $229 million. 61 Table of Contents We participate in a securities lending program where we loan certain investment securities for short periods of time in exchange for collateral, consisting of cash or U.S. Government securities, initially equal to at least 102% of the fair value of the investment securities on loan. Investment securities with a fair value of $437.1 million at December 31, 2008 and $1,336.1 million at December 31, 2007 were on loan. All collateral from lending our investment securities was in the form of cash deposited by the borrower with an independent lending agent. The cash collateral was invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-term corporate and asset-backed securities with an average maturity of approximately 250 days. The fair value of securities held as invested collateral was $402.4 million at December 31, 2008 and $1,337.0 million at December 31, 2007. The amortized cost of these investment securities was $437.2 million at December 31, 2008 and $1,337.0 million at December 31, 2007. Unrealized losses of $34.8 million at December 31, 2008 have been included as a component of stockholders equity and comprehensive income. Gross unrealized losses and fair value of investment securities aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at December 31, 2008. Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total 2008 Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses (in thousands) U.S. Government and agency obligations $ 163,626 $ (228 ) $ 4,297 $ (57 ) $ 167,923 $ (285 ) Tax exempt municipal securities 409,787 (22,238 ) 141,730 (17,975 ) 551,517 (40,213 ) Mortgage and asset-backed securities 542,051 (137,205 ) 126,354 (33,836 ) 668,405 (171,041 ) Corporate securities 422,005 (64,786 ) 98,124 (35,056 ) 520,129 (99,842 ) Debt securities 1,537,469 (224,457 ) 370,505 (86,924 ) 1,907,974 (311,381 ) Non-redeemable preferred stocks 7,388 (1,655 ) 7,388 (1,655 ) Total investment securities $ 1,544,857 $ (226,112 ) $ 370,505 $ (86,924 ) $ 1,915,362 $ (313,036 ) We regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment. We consider factors affecting the issuer, factors affecting the industry the issuer operates within, and general debt and equity market trends. We consider the length of time an investment fair value has been below carrying value, the severity of the decline, the near term prospects for recovery to cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. If and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to earnings. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations; facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time; or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. Given current market conditions, there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. Unrealized losses at December 31, 2008 resulted from 581 positions out of a total of 1,200 positions held with approximately 142 positions in an unrealized loss position greater than one year. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2008 primarily were caused by an increase in interest rate from a widening of credit spreads. All issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments, and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities. 62 Table of Contents After taking into account these and other factors, including the severity of the decline and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity, we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and, as such, no impairment was required. During 2008, we recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $103.1 million including credit related write-downs of $82.9 million and interest-related write-downs of $20.2 million. The credit-related impairments in 2008 primarily were due to investments in Lehman and certain of its subsidiaries, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008. The interest-related impairments were due to declines in values of securities, primarily associated with the financial services industry, for which we were uncertain of our intent to hold until recovery or maturity. There were no material other-than-temporary impairments in 2007 and 2006. Goodwill and Long-lived Assets At December 31, 2008, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 23% of total assets and 67% of total stockholders equity, compared to 20% and 63%, respectively, at December 31, 2007. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , or SFAS 142, requires that we test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable Commercial and Government segments. A component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios. We rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value. However outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We use a range of discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital. We also use a range of terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. Key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical and administrative cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. The fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a margin ranging from approximately 76% to 94%. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease this margin to a range of approximately 54% to 79%, and a 50 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would decrease this margin to a range of approximately 67% to 88%. The loss of the TRICARE South Region contract instead of the expected April 1, 2010 renewal would adversely affect approximately $50 million of the reporting unit goodwill. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. There were no impairment losses in the last three years. 63 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
