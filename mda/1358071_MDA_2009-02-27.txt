Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. Statements in our discussion may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause future production, revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations. 38 Table of Contents Overview We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploitation and exploration of producing oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of Southeastern New Mexico and West Texas. We have also acquired significant acreage positions in and are actively involved in drilling or participating in drilling in emerging plays located in the Permian Basin of Southeastern New Mexico and the Williston Basin in North Dakota, where we are applying horizontal drilling, advanced fracture stimulation and enhanced recovery technologies. Crude oil comprised 62.9 percent of our 137.3 MMBoe of estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2008, and 64.8 percent of our 7.1 MMBoe of production for 2008. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 93.1 percent of our proved developed producing PV-10 and 64.7 percent of our 3,553 gross wells at December 31, 2008. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used. Commodity prices Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil and natural gas, include developments generally impacting the Middle East and Iraq and Iran specifically; the extent to which members of the OPEC and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil supply through export quotas; the overall global demand for crude oil; and overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals, including the impact of the decline of the U.S. economy, weather conditions and liquefied natural gas deliveries to the United States. Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our commodity hedge positions at December 31, 2008. The 2008 oil prices were high compared to historical prices and have been particularly volatile. The NYMEX crude oil price per Bbl averaged $99.75, $72.45 and $66.26 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. The NYMEX natural gas price per MMBtu averaged $7.41, $6.11 and $6.06 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Further demonstrating the continuing volatility the NYMEX crude oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached lows of $33.98 per Bbl and $4.08 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2009 to February 19, 2009. At February 19, 2009, the NYMEX crude oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $39.48 per Bbl and $4.08 per MMBtu, respectively. Recent events Henry Entities acquisition. On July 31, 2008, we closed our acquisition of the Henry Entities and additional non-operated interests in oil and gas properties from persons affiliated with the Henry Entities. In August 2008 and September 2008, we acquired additional non-operated interests in oil and gas properties from persons affiliated with the Henry Entities. We paid approximately $584.1 million in net cash for the acquisition of the Henry Entities and the related acquisition of the along-side interests, which was funded with borrowings under our credit facility, which was amended and restated on July 31, 2008, and net proceeds of approximately $242.4 million from our private placement of 8,302,894 shares of our common stock. Amended and restated credit facility. On July 31, 2008, we amended and restated our credit facility in various respects, including increasing our borrowing base to $960 million, subject to scheduled semiannual redeterminations, and extending the maturity date from February 24, 2011 to July 31, 2013. The initial borrowing under the credit facility was $675 million. We paid an arrangement fee of $14.4 million upon closing of the amended and restated credit facility. On July 31, 2008, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our 2nd lien credit facility and terminated the facility. In October 2008, our $960 million borrowing base was reaffirmed until the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination in April 2009. Between scheduled borrowing base redeterminations, we and, if requested by 66 2 / 3 percent of the lenders, the lenders may each request one special redetermination. 39 Table of Contents Common stock private placement. On July 31, 2008, we closed a private placement of approximately 8.3 million shares of our common stock at $30.11 per share. The private placement resulted in net proceeds of approximately $242.4 million to us, after payment of approximately $7.6 million for the fee paid to the placement agent. 2009 capital budget. On November 6, 2008, our board of directors approved an initial capital budget for 2009 of up to approximately $500 million, predicated on us funding it substantially within our cash flow. The following is a summary of our initial 2009 capital budget: 2009 Budget (In millions) Drilling and recompletion opportunities in our core operating area $ 398 Projects operated by third parties 8 Emerging plays, acquisition of leasehold acreage and other property interests, and geological and geophysical 72 Maintenance capital in our core operating areas 22 Total 2009 capital budget $ 500 In light of the recent drop in commodity prices, we took the following actions in January 2009: reduced our operated drilling rig count in the Wolfberry play from eight to five; deferred our deepening program on our Southeastern New Mexico shelf properties; and deferred certain drilling activity in the Lower Abo horizontal play. The annualized effect of these changes in operating activity would reduce our 2009 capital spending to approximately $300 million, assuming our current estimate of 2009 capital costs. We will monitor our capital expenditures in relation to our cash flow and expect to adjust our activity and capital spending level based on changes in commodity prices and the cost of goods and services and other considerations. Short-term interruptions in production. During 2008, our production was interrupted on several occasions. The following were significant interruptions: None of our properties and facilities were directly impacted by Hurricane Ike; however, facilities which ultimately received our production, primarily natural gas liquids, sustained power interruptions and physical damage. As a result, our production was either curtailed or shut-in for significant periods of time. As a result, we estimate that our September 2008 production was reduced by approximately 117 MBoe and our October 2008 production was reduced by approximately 33 MBoe; On May 16, 2008, a refinery located in New Mexico shut down for ten days due to repairs. As a result, we shut-in approximately 37 MBoe of production during the ten day period; On April 7, 2008, a natural gas processing plant through which we process and sell a portion of the production from our New Mexico shelf properties was curtailed for its annual routine maintenance. The plant resumed full operation on April 19, 2008, and we thereafter began restoring production from all of our properties that had been affected. Approximately 75 MBoe of our production was shut-in as a result of this plant shut-down; and During the first quarter of 2008, we experienced short-term interruptions in our production on the New Mexico shelf properties due to operational problems with a natural gas processing plant. There were a total of 10 days of curtailment during the first quarter, and approximately 17 MBoe of our production was curtailed during this period. Derivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net asset of $172.4 million. All of our counterparties to these financial derivatives are party to our credit facility and have their outstanding debt commitments and derivative exposures collateralized pursuant to our credit 40 Table of Contents facility. Pursuant to the terms of our financial derivative instruments and their collateralization under our credit facility, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls on our financial derivative instruments. In light of the recent drop in commodity prices, most of our commodity derivative instruments are currently in a net asset position to us. We currently have no reason to believe that our counterparties to these commodity derivative contracts are not financially viable. Currently, all of our counterparties are parties to our credit facility, and our credit facility does not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender under our credit facility against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. New commodity derivative contracts. During 2008, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our estimated future production. The following table summarizes information about these additional commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2008: Aggregate Remaining Remaining Daily Index Contract Volume Volume Price Period Crude oil (volumes in Bbls): Price collar 768,000 2,104 $ 120.00 - $134.60 (a) 1/1/09 - 12/31/09 Price swap 292,000 800 $ 98.35 (a) 1/1/09 - 12/31/09 Price swap 348,000 953 $ 125.10 (a) 1/1/09 - 12/31/09 Price swap 240,000 658 $ 128.80 (a) 1/1/10 - 12/31/10 Price swap 336,000 921 $ 128.66 (a) 1/1/11 - 12/31/11 Price swap 504,000 1,377 $ 127.80 (a) 1/1/12 - 12/31/12 Natural gas (volumes in MMBtus): Price swap 1,825,000 5,000 $ 8.44 (b) 1/1/09 - 12/31/09 Index basis swap 6,022,500 16,500 $ 1.08 (c) 1/1/09 - 12/31/09 (a) The index prices for the oil price swaps are based on the NYMEX-West Texas Intermediate monthly average futures price. (b) The index price for the natural gas price collar is based on the Inside FERC-El Paso Permian Basin first-of-the-month spot price. (c) The basis differential between the El Paso Permian delivery point and NYMEX Henry Hub delivery point. Commodity derivative contracts assumed in the Henry Entities acquisition. As part of the Henry Entities acquisition, we assumed the following commodity derivative contracts on July 31, 2008. The following table summarizes information about the remaining portion of these assumed derivative contracts at December 31, 2008: Aggregate Remaining Remaining Daily Index Contract Volume Volume Price Period Crude oil (volumes in Bbls): Price swap 443,491 1,215 $ 73.59 (a) 1/1/09 - 12/31/09 Price swap 401,746 1,101 $ 72.03 (a) 1/1/10 - 12/31/10 Price swap 221,746 608 $ 68.92 (a) 1/1/11 - 12/31/11 (a) The index prices for the oil price swaps are based on the NYMEX-West Texas Intermediate monthly average futures price and the prices represent weighted average prices. New interest rate derivative contracts. During 2008, we entered into interest rate derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our future interest rate exposure. We hedged our LIBOR interest rate on our bank debt by fixing the rate at 1.90 percent for three years beginning in May of 2009 on $300 million of our bank debt. For this portion of our bank debt, the all-in interest rate will be calculated by adding the fixed rate of 1.90 percent to a margin that ranges from 1.25 percent to 2.00 percent depending on the amount of bank debt outstanding. 41 Table of Contents Items Impacting Comparability of our Financial Results Our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward, for the reasons described below: On February 24, 2006, we entered into a combination agreement in which we agreed to purchase the Chase Group Properties and combine them with substantially all of the outstanding equity interests of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. to form Concho. We have accounted for the combination transaction that occurred on February 27, 2006, as an acquisition by Concho Equity Holdings Corp. of the Chase Group Properties and a simultaneous reorganization of Concho such that Concho Equity Holdings Corp. became our wholly owned subsidiary. Concho Equity Holdings Corp. is our predecessor for accounting purposes. As a result, our historical financial statements prior to February 27, 2006, are the financial statements of Concho Equity Holdings Corp; On February 27, 2006, the initial closing of the Chase Oil transaction occurred, and we acquired the Chase Group Properties for approximately 35 million shares of common stock and approximately $409 million in cash; On March 27, 2007, we entered into a $200 million second lien term loan facility from which we received proceeds of $199 million that we used to repay the $39.8 million outstanding under our prior term loan facility and to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility by $154 million, with the remaining $5.2 million used to pay loan fees, accrued interest and for general corporate purposes; In August 2007, we completed our initial public offering of common stock from which we received proceeds of $173 million that we used to retire outstanding borrowings under our second lien term loan facility totaling $86.5 million, and to retire outstanding borrowings under our credit facility totaling $86.5 million; and On July 31, 2008, we closed our acquisition of the Henry Entities and additional non-operated interests in oil and gas properties from persons affiliated with the Henry Entities. In August 2008 and September 2008, we acquired additional non-operated interests in oil and gas properties from persons affiliated with the Henry Entities. We paid approximately $584.1 million in net cash for the acquisition of the Henry Entities and the related acquisition of the along-side interests, which was funded with borrowings under our credit facility, which was amended and restated on July 31, 2008, and net proceeds of approximately $242.4 million from our private placement of 8,302,894 shares of our common stock. Results of Operations The following table presents selected financial and operating information for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands, except price and daily volume data) Statement of operations data: Oil sales $ 390,945 $ 195,596 $ 131,773 Natural gas sales 142,844 98,737 66,517 Total operating revenues 533,789 294,333 198,290 Operating costs and expenses (excluding gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges) (315,265 ) (198,122 ) (134,862 ) Gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges 249,870 (20,274 ) Interest, net and other revenue (27,607 ) (34,558 ) (29,381 ) Income before income taxes 440,787 41,379 34,047 42 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands, except price and daily volume data) Income tax expense (162,085 ) (16,019 ) (14,379 ) Net income $ 278,702 $ 25,360 $ 19,668 Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 4,586 3,014 2,295 Natural gas (MMcf) 14,968 12,064 9,507 Total (MBoe) 7,081 5,025 3,880 Average daily production volumes: Oil (Bbl) 12,530 8,258 6,288 Natural gas (Mcf) 40,896 33,052 26,047 Total (Boe) 19,347 13,767 10,630 Average prices: Oil, without hedges (Bbl) $ 91.92 $ 68.58 $ 60.47 Oil, with hedges (Bbl) $ 85.25 $ 64.90 $ 57.42 Natural gas, without hedges (Mcf) $ 9.59 $ 8.08 $ 6.87 Natural gas, with hedges (Mcf) $ 9.54 $ 8.18 $ 7.00 Total, without hedges (Boe) $ 79.80 $ 60.54 $ 52.62 Total, with hedges (Boe) $ 75.38 $ 58.56 $ 51.12 Year ended December 31, 2008, compared to year ended December 31, 2007 Oil and gas revenues. Revenue from oil and gas operations was $533.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $239.5 million (81 percent) from $294.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to (i) the acquisition of the Henry Entities on July 31, 2008, (ii) increased production due to successful drilling efforts during 2008 and (iii) substantial increases in realized oil and gas prices. In addition: average realized oil prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $85.25 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 31 percent from $64.90 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2007; total oil production was 4,586 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 1,572 MBbl (52 percent) from 3,014 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2007; average realized natural gas prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $9.54 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 17 percent from $8.18 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2007; total natural gas production was 14,968 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 2,904 MMcf (24 percent) from 12,064 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2007; average realized barrel of oil equivalent prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $75.38 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 29 percent from $58.56 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2007; and total production was 7,081 MBoe for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 2,056 MBoe (41 percent) from 5,025 MBoe for the year ended December 31, 2007. See discussion in Recent events for information about our 2008 production interruptions. 43 Table of Contents Hedging activities. The oil and gas prices that we report are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted to give effect to the results of our cash flow hedging activities. We utilize commodity derivative instruments in order to (i) reduce the effect of the volatility of price changes on the commodities we produce and sell, (ii) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans and (iii) lock-in commodity prices to protect economics related to certain capital projects. The following is a summary of the effects of commodity hedges that qualify for hedge accounting treatment for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Crude Oil Hedges Natural Gas Hedges Years Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2008 2007 2008 2007 Hedging revenue increase (decrease) (in thousands) $ (30,591 ) $ (11,091 ) $ (696 ) $ 1,291 Hedged volumes (Bbls and MMBtus, respectively) 951,000 1,076,750 4,941,000 6,482,600 Hedged revenue increase (decrease) per hedged volume $ (32.17 ) $ (10.30 ) $ (0.14 ) $ 0.20 During the year ended December 31, 2008, our commodity price hedges decreased oil revenues by $30.6 million ($6.67 per Bbl). During the year ended December 31, 2007, our commodity price hedges decreased oil revenues by $11.1 million ($3.68 per Bbl). The effect of the commodity price hedges in decreasing oil revenues during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to their effect of decreasing oil revenues during the year ended December 31, 2007 was the result of (i) a higher average market price of NYMEX crude oil of $99.75 per Bbl in 2008 as compared to $72.45 per Bbl in 2007 and (ii) the greater price difference between NYMEX and the weighted average hedge price in 2008 as compared to 2007, partially offset by a lower amount of hedged volumes of 951,000 Bbls in 2008 as compared to 1,076,750 Bbls in 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, our commodity price hedges decreased gas revenues by $0.7 million ($0.05 per Mcf) as a result of the amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) into natural gas revenues from cash flow hedges that were dedesignated at June 30, 2007. Cash settlements for these dedesignated natural gas contracts were recorded as a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our commodity price hedges increased gas revenues by $1.3 million ($0.11 per Mcf) primarily as a result of the amount reclassified from AOCI to natural gas revenues from cash flow hedges that were dedesignated at June 30, 2007. At June 30, 2007, we determined that all of our natural gas commodity contracts no longer qualified as hedges under the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 133. As a result, amounts in AOCI at June 30, 2007 related to these dedesignated hedges remained in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings under natural gas revenues during the periods which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Cash settlements for these natural gas contracts are recorded to gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges. Regarding the dedesignated contracts, for the period January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007, when these natural gas contracts qualified to use hedge accounting, the cash settlement receipts of approximately $0.2 million were recorded in natural gas revenues. For the period July 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007, when these natural gas contracts no longer qualified to use hedge accounting, a pre-tax amount of $1.1 million was reclassified from AOCI to natural gas revenues and cash settlement receipts of $1.8 million was recorded to gains ( losses) on derivatives not designated as hedge. See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The above discussion on hedging activities does not represent the activities from all of our commodity derivative instruments. We have other commodity derivative instruments that we do not designate as hedges for accounting purposes. For further discussion and information see Gains (losses) on derivative instruments not designated as hedges below and Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 44 Table of Contents Oil and gas production costs. The following tables provide the components of our oil and gas production costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) Lease operating expenses $ 43,725 $ 6.17 $ 26,480 $ 5.27 Taxes: Ad valorem 2,738 0.39 2,012 0.40 Production 43,775 6.18 24,301 4.84 Workover costs 996 0.14 1,474 0.29 Total oil and gas production expenses $ 91,234 $ 12.88 $ 54,267 $ 10.80 Among the cost components of production expenses, in general, we have control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Lease operating expenses were $43.7 million ($6.17 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $17.2 million (65 percent) from $26.5 million ($5.27 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in lease operating expenses is due to (i) the wells acquired in the Henry Properties acquisition, which increased the absolute and per unit amount because those wells have a higher per unit cost as compared to our historical per unit cost, (ii) our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2008 and (iii) general inflation of field service and supply costs associated with rising commodity prices. Ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of (i) the Henry Properties acquisition and (ii) the increase in commodity prices. Production taxes per unit of production were $6.18 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 28 percent from $4.84 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is directly related to the increase in oil and gas revenues and the related increase in commodity prices. Over the same period our Boe prices (before the effects of hedging) increased 32 percent. Workover expenses were $1.0 million and $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 amount related primarily to workovers in Andrews County, Texas, while the 2007 amount related to a workover project on a property located in Gaines County, Texas. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Geological and geophysical $ 3,139 $ 4,089 Exploratory dry holes 3,723 21,923 Leasehold abandonments and other 31,606 3,086 Total exploration and abandonments $ 38,468 $ 29,098 Our geological and geophysical expense, which primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis, during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.1 million, a decrease of $1.0 million from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease is primarily attributable to a comprehensive seismic survey on our New Mexico shelf properties which was initiated in December 2007. 45 Table of Contents Our exploratory dry hole expense during the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily attributable to an unsuccessful operated exploratory well located in the Central Basin Platform. Our exploratory dry hole expense during the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily attributable to five unsuccessful operated exploratory wells. The costs associated with three of these wells drilled in the Western Delaware Basin in Culberson County, Texas, approximated $17.0 million. Another of these wells, which was drilled in Lea County, New Mexico, had costs of approximately $2.4 million. An additional $0.8 million was charged to exploratory dry hole costs relative to a target zone in the fifth of these wells in Eddy County, New Mexico, which was determined to be unsuccessful. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $31.6 million of leasehold abandonments, which relates primarily to the write-off of (i) our Fayetteville acreage position in Arkansas and (ii) a prospect in the Central Basin Platform in West Texas. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $3.1 million of leasehold abandonments, of which $0.7 million related to a prospect in Lea County, New Mexico, $0.8 million related to one prospect located in Edwards County, Texas and $0.5 million related to leasehold expiring in Southeastern New Mexico. The remaining $1.1 million was related to several individually minor leaseholds. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) Depletion of proved oil and gas properties $ 121,464 $ 17.15 $ 75,744 $ 15.07 Depreciation of other property and equipment 1,808 0.26 1,035 0.21 Amortization of intangible asset operating rights 640 0.09 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 123,912 $ 17.50 $ 76,779 $ 15.28 Crude oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 41.00 $ 92.50 Natural gas price used to estimate proved gas reserves at period end $ 5.71 $ 6.80 Depletion of proved oil and gas properties was $121.5 million ($17.15 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $45.8 million from $75.7 million ($15.07 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to (i) the Henry Properties acquisition for which the depletion rate was higher than that of our historical assets, (ii) capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2007 and 2008 and (iii) the decrease in the oil and natural gas prices between the years which were utilized to determine the proved reserves. The amortization of the intangible asset is a result of the value assigned to the operating rights that we acquired in the Henry Properties acquisition. The intangible asset is currently being amortized over an estimated life of approximately 25 years. Impairment of long-lived assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, we periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. As a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $18.4 million, which was comprised primarily of a fields in Reeves and Upton Counties, Texas and in North Dakota. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $7.3 million, 33 percent of which related to a field in Gaines County, Texas, 30 percent of which related to a field in Schleicher County, Texas, and 18 percent of which related to a field in Crane County, Texas. The remaining 19 percent was comprised of multiple immaterial wells in various counties. 46 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) General and administrative expenses recurring $ 36,170 $ 5.11 $ 22,419 $ 4.46 Non-recurring bonus paid to Henry Entities employees, see Note K 4,328 0.61 Non-cash stock-based compensation stock options 3,101 0.44 2,463 0.49 Non-cash stock-based compensation restricted stock 2,122 0.30 1,378 0.27 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements (4,945 ) (0.70 ) (1,083 ) (0.21 ) Total general and administrative expenses $ 40,776 $ 5.76 $ 25,177 $ 5.01 General and administrative expenses were $40.8 million ($5.76 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $15.6 million (62 percent) from $25.2 million ($5.01 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2008 over 2007 was primarily due to (i) the non-recurring bonus paid to Henry Entities employees, (ii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation for both stock options and restricted stock awards and (iii) an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses, partially offset by an increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements. As part of the Henry Entities acquisition, we agreed to pay certain of the Henry Entities employees a predetermined bonus amount, in addition to the compensation we pay these employees, over the next two years. Since these employees will earn this bonus over the next two years we are reflecting the cost in our general and administrative costs. We are reflecting this bonus amount as non-recurring as it is not controlled by our management. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information related to this bonus. We earn reimbursements as operator of certain oil and gas properties in which we own interests. As such, we earned reimbursements of $4.9 million and $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The increase in this reimbursement is directly related to the Henry Properties acquisition, as we own a lower working interest in these operated properties compared to our historical property base, thus we have a larger third-party reimbursement as compared to our historical property base. Bad debt expense. On May 20, 2008, we entered into a short-term purchase agreement with an oil purchaser to sell a portion of our oil production affected by a New Mexico refinery shut down due to repairs. On July 22, 2008, this purchaser declared bankruptcy. We fully reserved the receivable amount of $2.9 million due from this purchaser for June and July production during the year ended December 31, 2008. Contract drilling fees stacked rigs. We determined in January 2007 to reduce our drilling activities for the first three months of 2007. As a result, we recorded an expense during the year ended December 31, 2007 of approximately $4.3 million for contract drilling fees related to stacked rigs subject to daywork drilling contracts with two drilling contractors. We resumed the majority of our planned drilling activities in April 2007 and all planned drilling activities in June 2007. These costs were minimized during the first six months of 2007 as one contractor secured work for a rig for 71 days during that period and charged us only the difference between the then-current operating day rate pursuant to the contract and the lower operating day rate received from the new customer. Gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges. As discussed in Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, during the three months ended June 30, 2007, we determined that all of our natural gas commodity derivative contracts no longer qualified as hedges under the requirements of SFAS No. 133. If the hedge is no longer highly effective, according to SFAS No. 133, an entity shall discontinue hedge accounting for an existing hedge, prospectively, and during 47 Table of Contents the period the hedges became ineffective. In addition, for our new commodity and interest rate derivative contracts entered into after August 2007, we chose not to designate any of these contracts as hedges. As a result, any changes in fair value and any cash settlements related to these contracts are recorded in earnings during the related period. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the related cash payments for settlements for derivative contracts not designated as hedges was approximately $6.3 million. The non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for the derivative contracts not designated as hedges was a gain of $256.2 million. This is compared to cash receipts for settlements of $1.8 million and non-cash mark-to-market losses of $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest expense. Interest expense was $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $7.0 million from $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 5.1 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively. The weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $450.7 million and $436.3 million, respectively. The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to the Henry Properties acquisition in July 2008, offset by (i) the partial prepayment in August 2007 of $86.6 million on the 2nd lien credit facility and the repayment in August 2007 of $86.6 million on our previous revolving credit facility and (ii) a partial prepayment in March 2008 on our previous revolving credit facility utilizing cash from operations. Also, in July 2008, we repaid and terminated our 2nd lien credit facility which resulted in the write-off of approximately $1.1 million of deferred loan costs and approximately $0.4 million of original issue discount, both of which are included in interest expense. In March 2007, we reduced our previous revolving credit facility borrowing base by $100.0 million, or 21%, resulting in the write-off of $0.8 million of deferred loan costs, and repaid a term credit facility, resulting in the write-off of $0.4 million of deferred loan costs, both of which are included in interest expense. In August 2007, we made a $86.6 million partial prepayment on our 2nd lien credit facility from proceeds of our initial public offering, which resulted in the write-off of approximately $1.0 million of deferred loan costs and approximately $0.4 million of original issue discount, both of which are included in interest expense. The decrease in the weighted average interest rate is due to (i) improvement in market interest rates and (ii) the fact that the interest rate margins under our credit facility (and previous revolving credit facility) were lower than those under our 2nd lien credit facility. Income tax provision. We recorded an income tax expense of $162.1 million and $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 36.8 percent and 38.7 percent, respectively. We estimated a higher effective state income rate in 2007 than in 2008, which is primarily due to our estimate of income among the various states in which we own assets. Year ended December 31, 2007, compared to year ended December 31, 2006 Oil and gas revenues. Revenue from oil and gas operations was $294.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $96.0 million (48 percent) from $198.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily because of increased production as a result of the acquisition of the Chase Group Properties and secondarily due to successful drilling efforts during 2006 and 2007, coupled with moderate increases in realized oil and gas prices. In addition: average realized oil prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $64.90 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 13 percent from $57.42 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2006; total oil production was 3,014 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 719 MBbl (31 percent) from 2,295 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2006; average realized natural gas prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $8.18 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 17 percent from $7.00 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2006; 48 Table of Contents total natural gas production was 12,064 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 2,557 MMcf (27 percent) from 9,507 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2006; average realized barrel of crude oil equivalent prices (after giving effect to hedging activities) were $58.56 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 15 percent from $51.12 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2006; total production was 5,025 MBoe for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 1,145 MBoe (30 percent) from 3,880 MBoe for the year ended December 31, 2006; and total production during the year ended December 31, 2007 was reduced by approximately 110 MBoe as a result of the temporary shut-downs of a natural gas processing plant through which we process and sell a portion of our production. Hedging activities. The oil and gas prices that we report are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted to give effect to the results of our cash flow hedging activities. We utilize commodity derivative instruments in order to (i) reduce the effect of the volatility of price changes on the commodities we produce and sell, (ii) support our annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) lock-in commodity prices to protect economics related to certain capital projects. Following is a summary of the effects of commodity hedges that qualify for hedge accounting treatment for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Crude Oil Hedges Natural Gas Hedges Years Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 2007 2006 Hedging revenue increase (decrease) (in thousands) $ (11,091 ) $ (7,000 ) $ 1,291 $ 1,232 Hedged volumes (Bbls and MMBtus, respectively) 1,076,750 1,080,500 6,482,600 5,447,500 Hedged revenue increase (decrease) per hedged volume $ (10.30 ) $ (6.48 ) $ 0.20 $ 0.23 During the year ended December 31, 2007, our commodity price hedges decreased oil revenues by $11.1 million ($3.68 per Bbl). During the year ended December 31, 2006, our commodity price hedges decreased oil revenues by $7.0 million ($3.05 per Bbl). The effect of the commodity price hedges in decreasing oil revenues during the year ended December 31, 2007 more than their effect of decreasing oil revenues during the year ended December 31, 2006 was the result of (i) a higher average market price of NYMEX crude oil of $72.45 per Bbl in 2007 as compared to $66.26 per Bbl in 2006, and (ii) the higher hedged revenue per hedged volume in 2007 as compared to 2006, as shown in the table above, partially offset by a lower amount of hedged volumes in 2007 as compared to 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our commodity price hedges increased gas revenues by $1.3 million ($0.11 per Mcf). During the year ended December 31, 2006, our commodity price hedges increased gas revenues by $1.2 million ($0.13 per Mcf). The effect of commodity price hedges in increasing gas revenues in 2007 more than their effect of increasing gas revenues in 2006 was the result of a higher amount of hedged volumes in 2007 as compared to 2006, partially offset by (i) the lower hedged revenue per hedged volume in 2007 as compared to 2006 and (ii) a higher reference market price for natural gas of $6.11 per MMBtu in 2007 as compared to $6.06 per MMBtu in 2006. At June 30, 2007, we determined that all of our natural gas commodity contracts no longer qualified as hedges under the requirements of SFAS No. 133. As a result, amounts in AOCI at June 30, 2007 related to these dedesignated hedges remained in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings under natural gas revenues during the periods which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Cash settlements for these natural gas contracts are recorded to gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges. Regarding the dedesignated contracts, for the period January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2007, when these natural gas contracts qualified to use hedge accounting, the cash settlement receipts of approximately $0.19 million were recorded in natural gas revenues. For the period July 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007, when these natural gas contracts no longer qualified to use hedge accounting, a pre-tax amount of $1.1 million was reclassified from AOCI to natural gas revenues and cash 49 Table of Contents settlement receipts of $1.8 million was recorded to gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedge. See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Oil and gas production costs. The following tables provide the components of our oil and gas production costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) Lease operating expenses $ 26,480 $ 5.27 $ 20,424 $ 5.26 Taxes: Ad valorem 2,012 0.40 1,120 0.29 Production 24,301 4.84 15,762 4.06 Workover costs 1,474 0.29 516 0.14 Total oil and gas production expenses $ 54,267 $ 10.80 $ 37,822 $ 9.75 Among the cost components of production expenses, in general, we have control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Lease operating expenses were $26.5 million ($5.27 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $6.1 million (30 percent) from $20.4 million ($5.27 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in lease operating expenses is due to (i) lease operating expenses associated with the Chase Group Properties acquired in February 2006 of approximately $2.2 million, (ii) lease operating expenses associated with wells that were successfully completed in 2006 and 2007 as a result of our drilling activities and (iii) general inflation of field service and supply costs associated with rising commodity prices. Ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of (i) new wells that were successfully completed in 2006 and 2007 as a result of our drilling activities and (ii) the increase in commodity prices. Production taxes per unit of production were $4.84 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 19 percent from $4.06 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is directly related to the increase in oil and gas revenues and the related increase in commodity prices. Over the same period our Boe prices (before the effects of hedging) increased 15 percent. Workover expenses were $1.5 million and $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2007 amount related to a workover project on a property located in Gaines County, Texas, while the 2006 amount related primarily to workovers located in Andrews County, Texas. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (In thousands) Geological and geophysical $ 4,089 $ 2,185 Exploratory dry holes 21,923 3,192 Leasehold abandonments and other 3,086 235 Total exploration and abandonments $ 29,098 $ 5,612 Our geological and geophysical expense, which primarily consists of general and administrative costs for our geology department as well as seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis, during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $4.1 million, an increase of $1.9 million from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This 50 Table of Contents 87 percent increase is primarily attributable to a comprehensive seismic survey on our New Mexico shelf properties which was initiated in December 2007. Our exploratory dry holes expense during the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily attributable to five operated exploratory wells that were unsuccessful. The costs associated with three of these wells drilled in the Western Delaware Basin in Culberson County, Texas approximated $17.0 million. Another of these wells, which was drilled in the Southeastern New Mexico Basin in Lea County, New Mexico, had costs of approximately $2.4 million. An additional $0.8 million was charged to exploratory dry hole costs related to an unsuccessful targeted zone in the fifth of these wells in the Southeastern New Mexico Basin in Eddy County, New Mexico. Exploration expense of $1.7 million related to three unsuccessful outside operated wells located in Eddy County, New Mexico. Of our exploratory dry holes expense during the year ended December 31, 2006, $3.2 million was attributable to one unsuccessful exploratory well in Gaines County, Texas that we operated and one unsuccessful exploratory well in Val Verde County, Texas operated by another company. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $3.1 million of leasehold abandonments, of which $0.7 million related to a prospect in Lea County, New Mexico, $0.8 million related to one prospect located in Edwards County, Texas and $0.5 million related to leasehold expiring in Southeastern New Mexico. The remaining $1.1 million was related to several individually minor leaseholds. We had minimal leasehold abandonments during the year ended December 31, 2006. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) Depletion of proved oil and gas properties $ 75,744 $ 15.07 $ 59,872 $ 15.43 Depreciation of other property and equipment 1,035 0.21 850 0.22 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 76,779 $ 15.28 $ 60,722 $ 15.65 Crude oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 92.50 $ 57.75 Natural gas price used to estimate proved gas reserves at period end $ 6.80 $ 5.64 Depletion of proved oil and gas properties was $75.7 million ($15.07 per BOE) for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $15.8 million from $59.9 million ($15.43 per BOE) for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to (i) the acquisition of the Chase Group Properties and (ii) capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully completed in 2006 and 2007 as a result of our drilling activities. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to an increase in proved oil and natural gas reserves as a result of our successful development and exploratory drilling program. Impairment of long-lived assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, we review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. As a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets during the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $7.3 million, 33 percent of which related to wells drilled in Gaines County, Texas, 30 percent of which related to a well drilled in Schleicher County, Texas and 18 percent of which related to a well drilled in Crane County, Texas. The remaining 19 percent was comprised of multiple immaterial wells in various counties. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $9.9 million, 33 percent of which related to wells located in Pecos and Midland Counties, Texas, acquired in our Lowe Acquisition, 24 percent of which related to wells located in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico, acquired in our Lowe Acquisition, 11 percent of which related to a well drilled in Eddy County, New Mexico and 9 percent of which related to a well drilled in Mountrail County, North Dakota. The remaining 23 percent was comprised of multiple immaterial wells in various counties. 51 Table of Contents Contract drilling fees stacked rigs. We determined in January 2007 to reduce our drilling activities for the first three months of 2007. As a result, we recorded an expense during the six months ended June 30, 2007 of approximately $4.3 million for contract drilling fees related to stacked rigs subject to daywork drilling contracts with two drilling contractors. No additional costs were incurred from July 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007. We resumed the majority of our planned drilling activities in April 2007 and all planned drilling activities in June 2007. These costs were minimized during the first six months of 2007 as one contractor secured work for a rig for 71 days during that period and charged us only the difference between the then-current operating day rate pursuant to the contract and the lower operating day rate received from the new customer. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Amount Per Boe Amount Per Boe (In thousands, except per unit amounts) General and administrative expenses recurring $ 22,419 $ 4.46 $ 13,376 $ 3.45 Non-cash stock-based compensation Capital Options 975 0.25 Non-cash stock-based compensation stock options 2,463 0.49 7,125 1.84 Non-cash stock-based compensation restricted stock 1,378 0.27 1,044 0.27 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements (1,083 ) (0.21 ) (799 ) (0.21 ) Total general and administrative expenses $ 25,177 $ 5.01 $ 21,721 $ 5.60 General and administrative expenses were $25.2 million ($5.01 per BOE) for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $3.5 million (16 percent) from $21.7 million ($5.60 per BOE) for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to the increase in the size and complexity of our operations following the combination transaction and related increase in professional fees. In addition, annual bonuses in the aggregate amount of $2.5 million were paid to the officers and employees in April 2007 representing bonuses for 2006 performance as compared to $0.9 million aggregate bonuses paid to employees in February 2006. We earn revenue as operator of certain oil and gas properties in which we own interests. As such, we earned revenue of $1.1 million and $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This revenue is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges. As discussed in Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, during the three months ended June 30, 2007, we determined that all of our natural gas commodity derivative contracts no longer qualified as hedges under the requirements of SFAS No. 133. If the hedge is no longer highly effective, according to SFAS No. 133, an entity shall discontinue hedge accounting for an existing hedge, prospectively, and during the period the hedges became ineffective. In addition, for our new commodity and interest rate derivative contracts entered into after August 2007, we chose not to designate any of these contracts as hedges. As a result, any changes in fair value and any cash settlements related to these contracts are recorded in earnings during the related period. This is compared to cash receipts for settlements of $1.8 million and non-cash mark-to-market losses of $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest expense. Interest expense was $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $5.6 million from $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 7.7 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively. The weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $436.3 million and $406.8 million, respectively. The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2007 was our borrowings to fund our drilling activities, partially offset by the partial prepayment in August 2007 of $86.6 million on our 52 Table of Contents 2nd lien credit facility and the repayment in August 2007 of $86.6 million on our then revolving credit facility. The increase in interest expense is due to a slight increase in the weighted average interest rate, the increase in the weighted average debt and the acceleration of deferred loan cost amortization and original issue discount amortization. In March 2007, we reduced our then revolving credit facility borrowing base by $100.0 million, or 21 percent, resulting in accelerated amortization of $0.8 million, and the full repayment of the 2nd lien credit facility resulting in accelerated amortization of $0.4 million. The prepayment of $86.6 million on our New 2nd lien credit facility in August 2007 resulted in accelerated amortization of $1.0 million in deferred loan costs and $0.4 million in original issue discount. Income tax provision. We recorded income tax expense of $16.0 million and $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 38.7 percent and 42.2 percent, respectively. We estimated a lower effective state income rate in 2007 than in 2006, which is primarily due to our estimate of income among the various states in which we own assets. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources as discussed in Capital resources below. Oil and gas properties. Our capital expenditures on oil and gas properties, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $339.0 million, $180.5 million and $173.0 million, respectively. These expenditures were primarily funded by cash flow from operations. On November 6, 2008, our board of directors approved an initial capital budget for 2009 of up to approximately $500 million. The capital budget is predicated on us funding it substantially within cash flow. In light of the recent drop in commodity prices we took the following actions in January 2009: reduced our operated drilling rig count in the Wolfberry play from eight to five; deferred our deepening program on our Southeastern New Mexico shelf properties; and deferred certain drilling activity in the Lower Abo horizontal play. The annualized effect of these changes in operating activity would reduce the Company 2009 capital spending to approximately $300 million, assuming the Company current estimate of 2009 capital costs. We will monitor our capital expenditures in relation to our cash flow on a quarterly basis and will adjust our activity and capital spending level based on changes in commodity prices and the cost of goods and services. Other than leasehold acreage and other property interests, our 2009 capital budget is exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of exploitation, development, high-potential exploration and control of operations and that will allow us to apply our operating expertise. Although we cannot provide any assurance, we believe that our remaining cash balance and our cash flows will be sufficient to satisfy our 2009 capital budget; however, we could use our credit facility to fund such expenditures. The actual amount and timing of our expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, actual drilling results, the timing of expenditures by third parties on projects that we do not operate, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. In addition, under certain circumstances we would consider increasing or reallocating our 2009 capital budget. 53 Table of Contents Acquisitions. Our expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $838.0 million, $7.3 million and $1,044.7 million, respectively. The Henry Properties acquisition in July 2008 was primarily funded by a private placement of our common stock and borrowings under our credit facility. In February 2006, through the combination transaction we acquired the Chase Group Properties which was funded through our credit facility and the issuance of our common stock. Contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating lease obligations, drilling commitments (including commitments to pay day rates for drilling rigs), employment agreements, contractual bonus payments, derivative obligations and other liabilities. We had the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In thousands) Long-term debt(a) $ 630,000 $ $ $ 630,000 $ Operating lease obligations(b) 4,743 970 2,955 818 Drilling commitments(c) 28,730 25,858 2,872 Employment agreements with executive officers(d) 5,970 2,190 3,780 Henry Entities bonus obligation(e) 16,446 10,387 6,059 Derivative assets(f) (172,440 ) (111,283 ) (61,157 ) Asset retirement obligations(g) 16,809 2,611 604 598 12,996 Total contractual cash obligations $ 530,258 $ (69,267 ) $ (44,887 ) $ 631,416 $ 12,996 (a) See Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

(c) Consists of daywork drilling contracts related to drilling rigs contracted for 2009 and 2010. See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (d) Represents amounts of cash compensation we are obligated to pay to our executive officers under employment agreements assuming such employees continue to serve the entire term of their employment agreement and their cash compensation is not adjusted. An executive officer resigned as of March 31, 2008, and we will be obligated to pay him 1/12th of his base salary for each month from April 2008 through March 2009 as consideration for such person covenant not to compete with us in accordance with his employment agreement. Additionally, Steven L. Beal, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has given notice of his intent to retire from the Company effective June 30, 2009. As a result, only six months of Mr. Beal salary is included. (e) Represents bonuses we agreed to pay certain employees of the Henry Entities at each of the first and second anniversaries of the closing of the Henry Properties acquisition. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (f) Derivative obligations represent net asset for commodity and interest rate derivatives that were valued at December 31, 2008. The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our derivative obligations. (g) Amounts represent costs related to expected oil and gas property abandonments related to proved reserves by period, net of any future accretion. Off-balance sheet arrangements. Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 54 Table of Contents Capital resources. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operating activities and financing provided by our credit facilities. We believe that funds from operating cash flows and our credit facility should be sufficient to meet both our short-term working capital requirements and our 2009 capital budget plan. Cash flow from operating activities. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $391.4 million, $169.8 million and $112.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2008 over 2007 was principally due to (i) increases in our oil and gas production as a result of our exploration and development program, (ii) five months of activity from the acquired Henry Properties and (iii) increases in average realized oil and natural gas prices. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2007 over 2006 was principally due to increases in our oil and gas production as a result of our exploration and development program and cash flow from production attributable to the Chase Group Properties that we acquired in the combination transaction in February 2006. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we invested $946.1 million, $162.6 million and $595.6 million, respectively, for additions to, and acquisitions of, oil and gas properties, inclusive of dry hole costs. Cash flows used in investing activities were substantially higher during the year ended December 31, 2008 over 2007, primarily due to the Henry Properties acquisition, as well as increased drilling activity in 2008. Cash flows used in investing activities were substantially higher during the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the approximately $409.0 million cash portion of the consideration we paid to the Chase Group in the combination transaction and drilling activities in 2006. In order to preserve liquidity, we reduced our drilling activities and curtailed capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2007, until we were able to complete our second lien term loan facility in March 2007. Cash flow from financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $542.0 million, $19.9 million and $476.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we borrowed $767.8 million under our credit facilities and issued approximately 8.3 million shares of our common stock to fund the Henry Properties acquisition. In March 2007, we entered into a $200 million 2nd lien credit facility. The proceeds were principally used to repay the outstanding balance under our prior term loan facility and to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the approximately $409.0 million cash portion of the consideration paid to the Chase Group pursuant to the combination transaction and proceeds from private issuances of equity in our company. On July 31, 2008, we amended and restated our senior credit facility in various respects, including increasing the borrowing base to $960 million, subject to scheduled semiannual redetermination, and extending the maturity date from February 24, 2011 to July 31, 2013. We paid an arrangement fee of $14.4 million at closing of the credit facility. In October 2008, the borrowing base was reaffirmed at $960 million. The amount outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2008 was $630.0 million. Between scheduled borrowing base redeterminations, we and, if requested by 66 2 / 3 percent of the lenders, the lenders may each request one special redetermination. Advances on the credit facility bear interest, at our option, based on (i) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank ( JPM Prime Rate ) or (ii) a Eurodollar rate (substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate). The interest rates of Eurodollar rate advances and JPM Prime Rate advances vary, with interest margins ranging from 125 to 275 basis points and zero to 125 basis points, respectively, per annum depending on the balance outstanding. We pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the available borrowing base ranging from 25 to 50 basis points per annum. Our credit facility bore interest at 1.96 percent per annum at December 31, 2008. On July 31, 2008, we repaid all the amounts outstanding under our 2nd lien credit facility and terminated the facility. On June 5, 2008, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with certain unaffiliated third-party investors to sell certain shares of our common stock in a private placement (the Private Placement ) contemporaneous with the closing of the Acquisition. On July 31, 2008, we issued 8,302,894 shares of our common stock at 55 Table of Contents $30.11 per share pursuant to the Private Placement. We paid the placement agent of the Private Placement a fee of approximately $7.6 million, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $242.4 million. In conducting our business, we may utilize various financing sources, including (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock and (iv) common stock. We may also sell assets and issue securities in exchange for oil and gas assets or interests in oil and gas companies. Additional securities may be of a class senior to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined from time to time by our board of directors. Utilization of some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our Senior Credit Facility. Financial markets. The current state of the financial markets is uncertain. There have been financial related institutions that have (i) failed and been forced into government receivership, (ii) declared bankruptcy, (iii) been forced to seek additional capital and liquidity to maintain viability or (iv) merged to survive. The U.S. and world economy is experiencing a slow-down which is having an adverse impact on the financial markets. At December 31, 2008, we had $329.7 million of borrowing capacity under our credit facility. Even in light of the current uncertainty in the financial markets, we currently believe that our lenders under our credit facility have the ability to fund additional borrowings we may need for our business. We currently pay floating rate interest under our credit facility and we are unable to predict, especially in light of the current uncertainty in the financial markets, whether we will incur increased interest costs due to rising interest rates. We have utilized the use of interest rate derivatives to mitigate the cost of rising interest rates, and we may do additional interest rate derivatives in the future. In the current financial markets, we do not believe that we could refinance our credit facility and obtain comparable terms. Since our credit facility matures in July 2013, we have no immediate need to seek refinancing of our credit facility. To the extent we need additional funds, beyond those available under our credit facility, to operate our business or make acquisitions we would have to pursue other financing sources. These sources could include issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock, (iv) common stock or (v) other securities. We may also sell assets. However, in light of the current financial markets there are no assurances that we could obtain additional funding, or if available, at what cost and terms. Liquidity. Our principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At December 31, 2008, we had $17.8 million of cash on hand. At December 31, 2008, our borrowing base under our credit facility was $960 million, which provides us with $329.7 million of unused borrowing capacity. Our borrowing base is redetermined semi-annually, with the next redetermination occurring in April 2009. In addition to such semi-annual redeterminations, our lenders may request one additional redetermination during any twelve-month period. In general, redeterminations are based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserve levels. Upon a redetermination, our borrowing base could be substantially reduced. In light of the current commodity prices and the state of the financial community, there is no assurance that our borrowing base will not be reduced. Book capitalization and current ratio. Our book capitalization at December 31, 2008 was $1,955.2 million, consisting of debt of $630.0 million and stockholders equity of $1,325.2 million. Our debt to book capitalization was 32 percent and 30 percent at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.03 to 1.00 at December 31, 2008 as compared to 0.84 to 1.00 at December 31, 2007. Inflation and changes in prices. Our revenues, the value of our assets, our ability to obtain bank funding or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in commodity prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Commodity prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. During 2008, we received an average of $91.92 per barrel of oil and $9.59 per Mcf of natural gas before consideration of commodity derivative contracts compared to $68.58 per barrel of oil and $8.08 per Mcf of natural gas in the prior year. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and continued through the first six months of 2008, commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly. The higher prices have led to 56 Table of Contents increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on capital costs. We expect these costs to moderate into 2009 as a result of the recent rapid diminution in prices for oil and natural gas. Critical Accounting Policies and Practices Our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. In management opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management judgments and estimates are revenue recognition, the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets and valuation of stock-based compensation. Management judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates, as additional information becomes known. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities under this method. Exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, lease rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment, undeveloped leases and developmental dry holes are also capitalized. This accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found proved reserves. Generally, a gain or loss is recognized when producing properties are sold. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes. Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time, and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. The evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn our leasehold positions. Non-producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves. Individually significant non-producing properties are periodically assessed for impairment of value. Depletion of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method on an individual property or unit basis based on total estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves. Depletion of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using our total estimated net proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers. Service properties, equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 1 to 50 years. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and depletion are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. 57 Table of Contents Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Current accounting guidance allows only proved oil and natural gas reserves to be included in our financial statement disclosures. The SEC has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly alter future depletion and result in impairment of long-lived assets that may be material. Asset Retirement Obligations In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The primary impact of this standard on us relates to oil and natural gas wells on which we have a legal obligation to plug and abandon. SFAS No. 143 requires us to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The determination of the fair value of the liability requires us to make numerous judgments and estimates, including judgments and estimates related to future costs to plug and abandon wells, future inflation rates and estimated lives of the related assets. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than its future net cash flows, including cash flows from risk adjusted proved reserves. The evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas, future costs to produce these products, estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions to estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell. Estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation We adopted the modified prospective approach as prescribed under SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. Under this approach, we are required to expense all options and other stock-based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. The calculation of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary for using the various valuation methods utilized by us. We utilize (i) the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and (ii) the stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 , which became effective in 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other 58 Table of Contents generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. We adopted this statement January 1, 2008 and did not elect the fair value option for any of its eligible financial instruments or other items. As such, the adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In April 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39 ( FIN No. 39-1 ). FIN No. 39-1 clarifies that a reporting entity that is party to a master netting arrangement can offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that have been offset under the same master netting arrangement. FIN No. 39-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Adoption of FIN No. 39-1 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2007, the FASB ratified a consensus opinion reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) on EITF Issue 06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards . EITF Issue 06-11 requires an employer to recognize tax benefits realized from dividend or dividend equivalents paid to employees for certain share-based payment awards as an increase to additional paid-in capital and include such amounts in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb future tax deficiencies on share-based payment awards. If an entity estimate of forfeitures increases (or actual forfeitures exceed the entity estimates), or if an award is no longer expected to vest, entities should reclassify the dividends or dividend equivalents paid on that award from retained earnings to compensation cost. However, the tax benefits from dividends that are reclassified from additional paid-in capital to the income statement are limited to the entity pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies on the date of reclassification. The consensus in EITF Issue 06-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2007. Retrospective application of EITF Issue 06-11 is not permitted. Early adoption is permitted; however, we did not adopt EITF Issue 06-11 until the required effective date of January 1, 2008. The adoption of EITF Issue 06-11 has not had a significant effect on our financial statements since we historically have accounted for the income tax benefits of dividends paid for share-based payment awards in the manner described in the consensus. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141(R) ), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for acquisitions that occur in an entity fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, which will be our fiscal year 2009. The impact, if any, will depend on the nature and size of business combinations we consummate after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 . SFAS No. 160 requires that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160 also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. This statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008, which will be our fiscal year 2009. Based upon our December 31, 2008 consolidated balance sheet, the statement would have no impact. In December 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 110, Share-Based Payment ( SAB No. 110 ). SAB No. 110 amends SAB No. 107, Share-Based Payment , and allows for the continued use, under certain circumstances, of the simplified method in developing an estimate of the expected term on stock options accounted for under SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (revised 2004) . SAB No. 110 is effective for stock options granted after December 31, 2007. We continued to use the simplified method in developing an estimate of the expected term on stock options granted in 2008. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to 59 Table of Contents provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time our shares of common stock have been publicly traded. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( SFAS No. 161 ), which amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( SFAS No. 133 ), to provide an enhanced understanding of an entity use of derivative instruments, how they are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and their effect on the entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The provisions of SFAS No. 161 are effective as of January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS No. 161. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) No. SFAS No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets ( FSP SFAS No. 142-3 ). FSP SFAS No. 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS No. 142 ). The intent of FSP SFAS No. 142-3 is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141R and other applicable accounting literature. FSP SFAS No. 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. We are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of FSP SFAS No. 142-3 on our financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles , which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America. This statement is effective 60 days following the SEC approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles . We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have an impact on our financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1 Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities , ( FSP EITF 03-6-1 ) which provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 was effective for us on January 1, 2009 and all prior-period EPS data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) will be adjusted retroactively to conform to its provisions. Early application of FSP EITF 03-6-1 is not permitted. Although restricted stock awards meet this definition, we do not expect the application of FSP EITF 03-6-1 to have a significant impact on our reported earnings per share. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. SFAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active . FSP No. SFAS 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 as it relates to the valuation of financial assets in a market that is not active for those financial assets. This FSP is effective immediately and includes those periods for which financial statements have not been issued. We currently do not have any financial assets that are valued using inactive markets, and as a result, we are not impacted by the issuance of FSP No. SFAS 157-3. Recent Developments in Reserve Reporting The SEC recently approved new disclosure rules that allow oil and natural gas companies to more accurately report their assets in terms of volumes and values that investors can understand and use to make informed decisions. The new reporting requirement is effective on December 15, 2009. The new disclosure requirements include provisions that: permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes; 60 Table of Contents allow companies to disclose in SEC filed documents their probable and possible reserves to investors (currently, the SEC rules limit disclosure to only proved reserves); require companies to report the independence and qualifications of a reserves preparer or auditor; file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit; and report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior 12-month period rather than year-end prices. We are currently evaluating the impact these new reserve reporting requirements will have on our consolidated financial statements and our annual report on Form 10-K.
