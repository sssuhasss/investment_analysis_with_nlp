ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW We are a global leader in providing open source software technologies to enterprise customers. These offerings include our core enterprise operating system platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, our enterprise middleware platform, Red Hat JBoss Middleware, as well as our virtualization, cloud, and storage offerings and other Red Hat enterprise technologies. Open source software is an alternative to proprietary software and represents a different model for the development and licensing of commercial software code than that typically used for proprietary software. Because open source software code is often freely shared, there are customarily no licensing fees for the use of open source software. Therefore, we do not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself. We provide value to our customers through the development, aggregation, integration, testing, certification, delivery, maintenance and support of our Red Hat enterprise technologies, and by providing a level of performance, reliability, scalability and security for the enterprise technologies we package and distribute. Moreover, because communities of developers not employed by us assist with the creation of our open source offerings, opportunities for further innovation of our offerings are supplemented by these communities. We primarily offer our enterprise technologies in the form of annual or multi-year subscriptions, and we recognize revenue over the period of the subscription agreements with our customers. We market our offerings primarily to enterprise customers including large enterprises, government agencies, small- and medium-size businesses and educational institutions. We have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for Red Hat enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture. Our core enterprise operating system platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, has gained widespread ISV and IHV support. We have continued to build our open source architecture by expanding our enterprise offerings and introducing middleware, virtualization, cloud, storage and other offerings. We derive our revenue and generate cash from customers primarily from two sources: (i) subscription revenue and (ii) training and services revenue. These arrangements typically involve subscriptions to Red Hat enterprise technologies. Our revenue is affected by, among other factors, corporate, government and consumer spending levels. In evaluating the performance of our business, we consider a number of factors, including total revenue, deferred revenue, operating income, operating margin and cash flows from operations. The arrangements with our customers that produce this revenue and cash are explained in further detail in NOTE 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In our fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, we focused and expect in our fiscal year ended February 28, 2013 to continue to focus on, among other things, generating (i) widespread adoption of Red Hat enterprise technologies, including virtualization, cloud and storage technologies, by users globally, (ii) increased revenue from our existing user base by renewing existing subscriptions, converting users of free versions of our enterprise technologies to paying subscribers, providing additional value to our customers and growing the number of open source enterprise technologies we offer, (iii) increased revenue by providing additional consulting and other targeted services and (iv) increased revenue from channel partner relationships, including OEMs, IHVs, ISVs, cloud computing providers, VARs and system integrators, and from our own international expansion, among other means. Revenue. For the year ended February 29, 2012, total revenue increased 24.6%, or $223.8 million, to $1,133.1 million from $909.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2011. Subscription revenue increased 24.8% or $192.2 million, driven primarily by additional subscriptions related to our principal Red Hat Enterprise 44 Table of Contents Linux technologies, which continue to gain broader market acceptance in mission-critical areas of computing, and our expansion of sales channels and our geographic footprint. The increase is, in part, a result of the continued migration of enterprises in industries such as financial services, government, technology and telecommunications to our open source solutions from proprietary technologies. Training and services revenue increased 23.3% or $31.7 million for the year ended February 29, 2012 as compared to the year ended February 28, 2011. The increase is driven primarily by customer interest in new products and technologies. We believe the success of our business model is influenced by: the extent to which we can expand the breadth and depth of our technology and service offerings; our ability to enhance the value of subscriptions for Red Hat enterprise technologies through frequent and continuing innovations to these technologies while maintaining stable platforms over multi-year periods; our ability to generate increasing revenue from channel partner and other strategic relationships, including distributors, OEMs, IHVs, ISVs, cloud computing providers, VARs and system integrators; the acceptance and widespread deployment of open source technologies by small, medium and large enterprises, educational institutions and government agencies; our ability to generate recurring subscription revenue for Red Hat enterprise technologies; and our ability to provide customers with consulting and training services that generate additional revenue. Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue, current and long-term, balance at February 29, 2012 was $946.7 million. Because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies, deferred revenue improves predictability of future revenue. Deferred revenue at February 29, 2012 increased $174.4 million or 22.6% as compared to the balance at February 28, 2011 of $772.3 million. The change in deferred revenue reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of $174.4 million differs from the $176.9 million change in deferred revenue we reported on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended February 29, 2012 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate deferred revenue balances from our foreign subsidiaries functional currency into U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue. Our enterprise technologies are sold under subscription agreements. These agreements typically have a one- or three-year subscription period. The subscription entitles the end user to maintenance, which generally consists of a specified level of support, as well as security updates, fixes, functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technology, when and if available, during the term of the subscription. Our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive. Subscription revenue increased sequentially for each quarter of fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 and is being driven primarily by the increased market acceptance and use of open source software by the enterprise and our expansion of sales channels and geographic footprint during these periods. Revenue by geography. In the year ended February 29, 2012, approximately $510.5 million or 45.1% of our revenue was generated outside the United States compared to approximately $397.0 million or 43.7% for the year ended February 28, 2011. Our international operations are expected to continue to grow as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations. As of February 29, 2012, we had offices in more than 75 locations throughout the world. 45 Table of Contents We operate our business in three geographic regions: the Americas (U.S., Latin America and Canada); EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa); and Asia Pacific (principally Japan, Singapore, India, Australia, South Korea and China). Revenue generated by the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific for the three years ended February 29, 2012 was as follows (in thousands): Americas EMEA Asia Pacific Total Year ended February 29, 2012 $ 716,033 $ 257,603 $ 159,467 $ 1,133,103 Year ended February 28, 2011 $ 583,795 $ 199,646 $ 125,836 $ 909,277 Year ended February 28, 2010 $ 474,633 $ 168,134 $ 105,469 $ 748,236 Year-over-year revenue growth rates for our three geographical regions were as follows for the three years ended February 29, 2012: Americas EMEA Asia Pacific Total Year ended February 29, 2012 22.7 % 29.0 % 26.7 % 24.6 % Year ended February 28, 2011 23.0 % 18.7 % 19.3 % 21.5 % Year ended February 28, 2010 12.5 % 18.7 % 18.6 % 14.7 % Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, revenue from EMEA and Asia Pacific grew approximately 23.0% and 16.0%, respectively, for the year ended February 29, 2012. Asia Pacific currency-adjusted, year-over-year growth rate of approximately 16.0% was achieved despite the earthquake and related disasters in Japan, the only country outside of the U.S. approaching 10% of total revenue. As we expand further within each region, we anticipate revenue growth rates to become more similar among our geographic regions due to the similarity of products and services offered and the similarity in customer types or classes. Gross profit margin. Gross profit margin increased to 84.2% for the year ended February 29, 2012 from 83.5% for the year ended February 28, 2011 as a result of both an overall increase in profit margins related to training and services and a slight product mix shift to subscriptions. Gross profit margin on training and services revenue increased to 33.0% for the year ended February 29, 2012 from 28.4% for the year ended February 28, 2011, primarily as a result of higher utilization rates for our consulting personnel and the implementation of a contractual arrangement with a global training partner that provides certain training services on our behalf and bears a portion of the fixed cost of providing such services, which makes our training expenses more variable with demand. Gross profit margin by geography . Gross profit margins generated by our geographic segments for the three years ended February 29, 2012 were as follows: Americas EMEA Asia Pacific Total Year ended February 29, 2012 84.4 % 87.7 % 82.7 % 84.2 % Year ended February 28, 2011 83.6 % 87.9 % 82.2 % 83.5 % Year ended February 28, 2010 85.4 % 87.7 % 81.1 % 84.8 % As we continue to expand our sales and support services within our geographic segments, we expect gross profit margins to further converge over the long run due to the similarity of products and services offered, similarity in production and distribution methods and the similarity in customer types or classes. Regional year-over-year variations in gross profit margins are typically due to slight product mix shifts between subscriptions and services, with the exception of the decrease in the Americas gross profit margin from 85.4% for the year 46 Table of Contents ended February 28, 2010 to 83.6% for the year ended February 28, 2011, which was due to both a slight product mix shift and lower gross margins on training and services revenue as we used more outside consultants and off-site training facilities to deliver our training and professional services during the year ended February 28, 2011. Income from operations. Operating income was 17.6% and 16.0% of total revenue for the year ended February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011, respectively. The increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue is a result of both the increase in gross profit margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percent of revenue. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to 66.6% for the year ended February 29, 2012 from 67.5% for the year ended February 28, 2011. The decrease in operating expenses results primarily from a reduction in professional services expenses related to litigation of $9.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2012 as compared to the year ended February 28, 2011. Income from operations by geography. Operating income as a percentage of revenue generated by our geographic segments for the three years ended February 29, 2012 was as follows: Americas EMEA Asia Pacific Total (1) Year ended February 29, 2012 23.1 % 29.0 % 24.7 % 17.6 % Year ended February 28, 2011 19.9 % 29.6 % 24.9 % 16.0 % Year ended February 28, 2010 17.9 % 23.0 % 23.8 % 13.4 % (1) Total operating income as a percentage of revenue includes corporate (non-allocated) share-based compensation expense for the years ending February 29, 2012, February 28, 2011 and February 28, 2010 of $79.3 million, $60.6 million and $48.3 million, respectively. For additional information, see NOTE 20 Segment Reporting. Operating margin for the Americas increased to 23.1% for the year ended February 29, 2012 from 19.9% for the year ended February 28, 2011 primarily as a result of reduced professional services expenses related to litigation that arose in the Americas. Operating margin for EMEA decreased to 29.0% for the year ended February 29, 2012 from 29.6% for the year ended February 28, 2011 as a result of a product mix shift from subscriptions to services. Cash, cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities and cash flow from operations. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investments in securities balances at February 29, 2012 totaled $1.3 billion. Cash generated from operating activities for the year ended February 29, 2012 totaled $391.9 million, which represents an increase of 34.8% in operating cash flow as compared to the year ended February 28, 2011. This increase is due to an increase in subscription and services revenues, billings and collections during the same period. Our significant cash and investment balances give us a measure of flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as acquisitions, increasing investment in international areas and repurchasing our common stock. Foreign currency exchange rates impact on results of operations. Approximately 45.1% of our revenue for the year ended February 29, 2012 was produced by sales outside the United States. We are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses, which are recorded as a component in determining net income. The statements of operations of our non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions results in increased revenue and operating expenses from operations for our non-U.S. operations. Similarly, our revenue and operating expenses will decrease for our non-U.S. operations if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. 47 Table of Contents Using the average foreign currency exchange rates from our prior fiscal year ended February 28, 2011, our revenue and operating expenses from non-U.S. operations for the year ended February 29, 2012 would have been lower than we reported using the average exchange rates for our current fiscal year ending February 29, 2012 by approximately $26.4 million and $17.5 million, respectively, which would have resulted in income from operations being lower by $8.9 million. Business combinations. On October 7, 2011, we acquired Gluster, Inc. ( Gluster ). Gluster develops, distributes and provides support for open-source, scale-out storage software. The acquisition expands our enterprise software offerings to include management of unstructured data. Total consideration transferred as part of the acquisition was $137.2 million and includes cash consideration of $135.9 million and equity consideration related to assumed, nonvested employee share-based awards of $1.2 million. The total fair value, as of October 7, 2011, of all assumed nonvested awards was $14.5 million, of which $1.2 million has been attributed to pre-acquisition employee services and accordingly has been recognized as consideration transferred. The remaining $13.3 million of fair value will be recognized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting period. See NOTE 3 Business Combinations to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to our acquisition of Gluster. On November 19, 2010, we acquired Makara, a developer of deployment and management solutions for applications in the cloud. For further discussion, see NOTE 3 Business Combinations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 48 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in NOTE 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements and describe our methods for applying U.S. GAAP in areas such as revenue recognition, deferred selling costs, fair value measurements, and foreign currency translation among other areas deemed significant. In applying certain significant accounting policies, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates, which we discuss further below. Critical accounting estimates are applied in the following areas: Revenue recognition; Goodwill and other long-lived assets; Share-based compensation; Income taxes; and Loss contingencies Revenue recognition Application of accounting principles related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires judgment. For example, in transactions that include multiple elements, we must exercise judgment in determining whether adequate vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for each undelivered element. Changes to the elements in a transaction, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, and changes in the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. In addition, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element transaction should be treated as separate units of accounting. Goodwill and other long-lived assets We make judgments about the recoverability of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, including capitalized software purchased or developed for internal-use. The assumptions and estimates used to determine recoverability of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal, multi-year forecasts for our subscription and services offerings which often include emerging technologies. Changes in any of these various factors could materially impact our financial position, results of operations and or cash flows. Share-based compensation We are required to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the number of share-based awards that we expect will ultimately vest and the amount of tax benefits we expect will ultimately be realized, among other things. Share-based awards expected to vest We currently apply an estimated annual forfeiture rate of 10% to the service-based share awards we grant to our employees. Our estimated forfeiture rate is based on recent historical experience as well as qualitative 49 Table of Contents considerations about management expectations for attrition rates over the vesting periods. Actual attrition rates could vary significantly from our expectations resulting in material quarterly adjustments to our financial results. During the year ended February 29, 2012 we granted service-based share awards with a total fair value of $98.2 million to which we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate of 10%. With respect to performance-based awards that we grant to certain executives, we estimate the number of shares expected to vest based primarily on our most current reported financial results relative to a defined peer group most recent reported financial results. Because past or current financial trends may not be predictive of future financial performance, our estimate of the number of shares expected to vest may differ materially from the number of shares that actually vest. The number of potential performance-based shares available to vest as of February 29, 2012 totaled 1.7 million, of which 1.2 million are expected to vest. If all of the potential performance-based shares were to vest, we would be required to recognize an additional expense of approximately $6.6 million. See NOTE 13 Share-based Awards for further discussion related to awards outstanding and expected to vest. Income tax benefits related to share-based awards We recognize share-based compensation expense based on an award grant date fair value over the requisite service period. Because we do not know the actual amount of tax benefits an award will generate until such award is exercised (or vested), we assume that the amount ultimately recognized for tax purposes will be the same amount we recognized in our operating results, that is for book purposes. Consequently, our deferred tax asset related to shared-based compensation expense which totaled $21.1 million as of February 29, 2012 is based on each qualifying award grant date fair value rather than the award to-be-determined exercise date intrinsic value (or vesting date fair value). Historically, the difference between the grant date fair value and the exercise date intrinsic value has been significant. As a result of such differences, for the years ending February 29, 2012, February 28, 2011 and February 28, 2010, we realized excess tax benefits related to share-based awards totaling $29.9 million, $42.3 million and $35.6 million respectively. If the share price for our common stock were to depreciate for a sustained period of time we could be required to recognize a tax benefit shortfall. Such shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and to the extent such shortfalls accumulate in excess of approximately $125.0 million (our APIC credit pool ) could materially, adversely impact our results of operations. For further discussion, see NOTE 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, NOTE 11 Income Taxes and NOTE 13 Share-based Awards to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income taxes As described in NOTE 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we account for income taxes using the liability method in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which primarily consist of share-based compensation expense deductions (described above), tax credit carryforwards and deferred revenue. In assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. As of February 29, 2012, deferred tax assets totaled $124.6 million, of which $3.6 million was offset by a valuation allowance. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets with respect to certain foreign net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards. For further discussion regarding deferred income taxes see NOTE 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and NOTE 11 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 Table of Contents Because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations, significant judgment is required. As a result, we make certain estimates and assumptions in (i) calculating our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, (ii) determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and (iii) evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain tax positions. Our estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized. For further discussion regarding uncertain tax positions see NOTE 11 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Loss Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the course of conducting our business, including losses related to legal proceedings and claims brought against us. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in evaluating both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a potential loss. Until the final resolution of a matter, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amount could be material. Should any of our estimates or assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 51 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011 The following table is a summary of our results of operations for the years ended February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011 (in thousands): Year Ended February 29, 2012 February 28, 2011 $ Change % Change Revenue: Subscriptions $ 965,575 $ 773,404 $ 192,171 24.8 % Training and services 167,528 135,873 31,655 23.3 Total subscription and training and services revenue $ 1,133,103 $ 909,277 $ 223,826 24.6 % Cost of subscription and training and services revenue: Cost of subscriptions 66,237 52,997 13,240 25.0 As a % of subscription revenue 6.9 % 6.9 % Cost of training and services 112,311 97,290 15,021 15.4 As a % of training and services revenue 67.0 % 71.6 % Total cost of subscription and training and services revenue $ 178,548 $ 150,287 $ 28,261 18.8 % As a % of total revenue 15.8 % 16.5 % Total gross profit $ 954,555 $ 758,990 $ 195,565 25.8 % Operating expense: Sales and marketing 419,635 327,408 92,227 28.2 Research and development 208,662 171,253 37,409 21.8 General and administrative 126,345 114,653 11,692 10.2 Total operating expense $ 754,642 $ 613,314 $ 141,328 23.0 % Income from operations 199,913 145,676 54,237 37.2 Interest income 8,418 6,743 1,675 24.8 Other income (expense), net (322 ) 1,275 (1,597 ) (125.3 ) Income before provision for income taxes $ 208,009 $ 153,694 $ 54,315 35.3 % Provision for income taxes 61,383 46,416 14,967 32.2 Net income $ 146,626 $ 107,278 $ 39,348 36.7 % Gross profit margin subscriptions 93.1 % 93.1 % Gross profit margin training and services 33.0 % 28.4 % Gross profit margin 84.2 % 83.5 % As a % of total revenue: Subscription revenue 85.2 % 85.1 % Training and services revenue 14.8 % 14.9 % Sales and marketing expense 37.0 % 36.0 % Research and development expense 18.4 % 18.8 % General and administrative expense 11.2 % 12.6 % Total operating expenses 66.6 % 67.5 % Income from operations 17.6 % 16.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 18.4 % 16.9 % Net income 12.9 % 11.8 % Effective income tax rate 29.5 % 30.2 % 52 Table of Contents Revenue Subscription revenue Subscription revenue, which is primarily comprised of direct and indirect sales of Red Hat enterprise technologies, increased by 24.8%, or $192.2 million, to $965.6 million for the year ended February 29, 2012 from $773.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2011. The increase in subscription revenue is primarily due to increases in volumes sold, including additional subscriptions attributable to geographic expansion, and continuing innovation, which attracts new customers and helps to drive renewals from existing customers. Training and services revenue Training revenue includes fees paid by our customers for delivery of educational materials and instruction. Services revenue includes fees received from customers for consulting services regarding our offerings, deployment of Red Hat enterprise technologies and for delivery of added functionality to Red Hat enterprise technologies for our major customers and OEM partners. Total training and services revenue increased by 23.3%, or $31.7 million, to $167.5 million for the year ended February 29, 2012 from $135.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2011. Training revenue increased 12.9% or $5.8 million as some enterprises began to increase overall spending on discretionary items such as training and related travel in response to a better overall economic environment. Our services revenue increased by 28.5% or $25.9 million as a result of both a better overall economic environment and increased subscription sales. Combined training and services revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 14.8% and 14.9% for the year ended February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011, respectively. Cost of revenue Cost of subscription revenue The cost of subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to support, distribute, manufacture and package Red Hat enterprise technologies. These costs include labor related cost to provide technical support and maintenance, as well as cost for fulfillment, physical media, literature, packaging and shipping. Cost of subscription revenue increased by 25.0% or $13.2 million to $66.2 million for the year ended February 29, 2012 from $53.0 million for the year ended February 28, 2011. Employee related expenses increased $10.1 million for the year ended February 29, 2012 as compared to the year ended February 28, 2011, and includes approximately $8.7 million related to the expansion of our technical staff to meet the demands of our growing subscriber base for support and maintenance. The remaining increase relates primarily to increased facilities costs which increased by $1.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2012 as compared to the year ended February 28, 2011. As the number of open source technology subscriptions continues to increase, we expect associated support cost will continue to increase, although we anticipate this will occur at an overall slower rate than that of subscription revenue growth due to economies of scale. Gross profit margin on subscriptions was 93.1% for each of the years ended February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011. Cost of training and services revenue Cost of training and services revenue is mainly comprised of personnel and third-party consulting costs for the design, development and delivery of custom engineering, training courses and professional services provided to various types of customers. Cost of training and services revenue increased by 15.4% or $15.0 million to $112.3 million for the year ended February 29, 2012 from $97.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2011. The cost to deliver training decreased 2.8% or $0.9 million to $31.4 million for the year ended February 29, 2012 compared to $32.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2011. Costs to deliver training decreased as a percentage of training revenue to 61.6% for the year ended February 29, 2012 from 71.6% for the year ended February 28, 2011 due to better utilization of both instructors and class room space as we implemented a contractual arrangement with a global training partner that provides certain training services on our behalf and bears a portion of the fixed cost of providing such services, which makes our training expenses more variable with demand. Costs to deliver 53 Table of Contents our services revenue increased by 24.5% or $15.9 million to $80.9 million for the year ended February 29, 2012. The increase in costs to deliver services includes $10.8 million of increased employee related expenses, the majority of which are the result of expanding our professional consulting staff. Increased employee related costs were partially offset by better resource utilization, which resulted in an increase in profit margin from professional services to 30.6% for the year ended February 29, 2012 from 28.4% for the year ended February 28, 2011.

The remaining increase relates primarily to process and technology infrastructure investments which increased by $4.1 million. As the number of open source technology subscriptions continues to increase, we expect associated support cost will continue to increase, although we anticipate this will occur at an overall slower rate than that of subscription revenue growth due to economies of scale.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have historically derived a significant portion of our liquidity and operating capital from cash flows from operations as well as the sale of equity securities, including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial and follow-on public offerings, and the issuance of convertible debentures. At February 29, 2012, we had total cash and investments of $1.3 billion, which was comprised of $549.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, $262.6 million of short-term, available-for-sale fixed-income investments, $1.3 million of available-for-sale equity securities, $446.8 million of long-term, available-for-sale fixed-income investments, and $0.4 million in deposit accounts with maturity dates greater than 30 days. This compares to total cash and investments of $1.2 billion at February 28, 2011. With $549.2 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand, we believe our cash and cash equivalent balances, together with our ability to generate additional cash from operations, should be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. We presently do not intend to liquidate our short and long-term investments in debt securities prior to their scheduled maturity dates. However, in the event that we liquidate these investments prior to their scheduled maturities and there are adverse changes in market interest rates or the overall economic environment, we could be required to recognize a realized loss on those investments when we liquidate. At February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011, accumulated unrealized losses on our available-for-sale debt securities totaled $1.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively.

Investments in debt and equity securities Our investments are comprised primarily of debt securities that are classified as available for sale and recorded at their fair market values. At February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011, the vast majority of our investments were priced by pricing vendors. These pricing vendors use the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available for these securities, use other observable inputs. In the event observable inputs are not available, we assess other factors to determine the securities market value, including broker quotes or model valuations. Independent price verifications of all of our holdings are performed by the pricing vendors, which we review. In the event a price fails a pre-established tolerance check, it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value. Capital requirements We have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations, the development of our enterprise technologies, the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity. Our capital requirements during the year ending February 28, 2013 will depend on numerous factors, including the amount of resources we devote to: funding the continued development of our enterprise technology offerings; 61 Table of Contents accelerating the development of our systems management offerings; improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers and support our business; pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances; investing in businesses, products and technologies; and investing in enhancements to the systems we use to run our business and the expansion of our office facilities, including capital expenditures related to our future headquarters facility discussed in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-K under the heading Properties. We have utilized, and will continue from time to time to utilize, cash and investments to fund, among other potential uses, purchases of our common stock, purchases of fixed assets, purchases of intellectual property and mergers and acquisitions. Given our historically strong operating cash flow and the $1.3 billion of cash and investments held at February 29, 2012, we do not presently anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations, either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt, in the foreseeable future. However, we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital. We believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve; however, there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make. We may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans, which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means. There can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us, if at all. Off-balance sheet arrangements As of February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011, we have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt , special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes. Contractual obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at February 29, 2012 (in thousands): Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations(1) $ 163,755 $ 25,602 $ 36,035 $ 30,189 $ 71,929 Purchase obligations Total $ 163,755 $ 25,602 $ 36,035 $ 30,189 $ 71,929 (1) Includes $24.5 million in commitments related to our current headquarters facility and $70.1 million in commitments related to a building we intend to use as our future headquarters facility. For additional information, see our discussion in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-K under the heading Properties . To the extent we cease to use any space in our current headquarters facility prior to the expiration of the lease term, we plan to sublease such space to a third party and anticipate that sublease income would offset existing contractual obligations. However, to the extent we are unable to sublease or otherwise dispose of such space and recover the full amount of our existing contractual obligation, we would be required to recognize a loss. Obligations under contracts that we may cancel without significant penalty are not included in the table above. In addition, because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlements and any future payments related to uncertain tax positions, such liabilities are not included in the above table. However, as of February 29, 2012, we have recognized a total of $24.7 million related to such liabilities, which are included in other long-term obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 62 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210) Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (ASU 2011-11), to require entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments. ASU 2011-11 is effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2014 ( fiscal 2014 ). We currently believe there will be no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU 2011-08), to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment. ASU 2011-08 allows entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If a greater than 50 percent likelihood exists that the fair value is less than the carrying amount then a two-step goodwill impairment test as described in Topic 350 must be performed. ASU 2011-08 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2013 but is eligible for early adoption. We adopted ASU 2011-08 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05), to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011-05 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2013 and should be applied retrospectively. We currently believe there will be no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (Topic 820) Fair Value Measurement (ASU 2011-04), to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 is effective for us in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and should be applied prospectively. We do not currently have level 3 fair value measurements and as a result, adopting ASU 2011-04 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 63 Table of Contents
