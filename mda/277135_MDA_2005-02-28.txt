Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General. Grainger is the leading broad-line supplier of facilities maintenance and other related products in North America. For each of the three years presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, Grainger reported its operating results in three segments: Branch-based Distribution, Lab Safety and Integrated Supply. Grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches, field sales forces, direct marketing including catalogs, and a variety of electronic and Internet channels. Grainger serves customers through a network of 582 branches, 17 distribution centers and multiple Web sites. Beginning January 1, 2005, Grainger Integrated Supply business will no longer offer on-site integrated purchasing and tool crib management services and will be merged into Grainger Industrial Supply division within the Branch-based Distribution segment. Grainger Industrial Supply plans to fulfill, but not renew, existing Integrated Supply contracts. As such, in 2005 Integrated Supply will no longer be reported as a separate segment and Grainger will report its operating results in two segments: Branch-based Distribution and Lab Safety. Business Environment. Several economic factors and industry trends shape Grainger business environment. The current overall economy and leading economic indicators forecast by economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in the development of projections for the upcoming year. At the start of 2005, the Consensus Forecast-USA is predicting GDP and Industrial Production growth of 3 to 4 percent for 2005. In 2004, Grainger benefited from the economic recovery in the United States. Grainger sales correlate positively with production growth. With the improvement in Industrial Production and general growth in the economy, Grainger realized an increase in sales across all customer segments. Grainger sales also tend to increase when non-farm payrolls grow, especially during economic recoveries. Non-farm payrolls increased approximately 1%, on average, in 2004 over 2003. For 2004, Grainger benefited from the combination of increased Industrial Production and non-farm payroll growth. The light and heavy manufacturing customer segments, which comprised over 25% of Grainger total 2004 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels increased less than 1% during 2004, while manufacturing output increased approximately 4.8%. This contributed to the double-digit sales growth in the light and heavy manufacturing customer segments for Grainger in 2004. Economic forecasts suggest that the manufacturing sector will continue to expand in 2005. In 2004, Grainger launched a multiyear initiative to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer. The success of the market expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2005 and beyond. Three phases of the market expansion program were in progress at December 31, 2004, and are scheduled for completion in 2005. Additional phases are scheduled for 2005 and beyond. The customer buying behavior is also important in Grainger business environment. Grainger believes that customers will continue to focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance products. Grainger is therefore increasing product information available to employees for improved service to customers by installing an upgraded SAP operating system and accelerating the replacement of its legacy information systems with a new integrated software package also provided by SAP, starting with the U.S. branch-based businesses. Integration, volume and user acceptance testing is currently scheduled for the third quarter of 2005. Grainger financial strength, including its low debt and strong cash flow, leaves it well positioned to fund major initiatives, improve effectiveness and accelerate top line growth. Capital spending in 2004 related to the branch network and information technology was approximately $118 million, with total capital expenditures of nearly $161 million. Capital spending was approximately $20 million higher than the most recent forecast due to the acceleration of the replacement and upgrade of the branch communication systems and the ongoing SAP initiatives. In 2005, total capital expenditures of $150 to $180 million are anticipated. Grainger intends to continue its investment in the market expansion program and information technology enhancements with spending planned for the following major projects: $60 to $70 million for continued market expansion; $35 to $40 million for information technology; and $10 to $12 million for Canadian branch programs. Capital spending for the market expansion program may be affected by lease or purchase decisions, based on availability of facilities. 9 Matters Affecting Comparability. Grainger operating results for 2004 included a full year of operating results of Gempler s. Grainger operating results for 2003 included the results of Gempler only from the acquisition date of April 14, 2003. Gempler results are included in the Lab Safety segment. Grainger has made reclassifications to the prior years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, to reduce cost of merchandise sold and increase operating (advertising) expenses for vendor provided funding in order to maintain comparable reporting with the year ended December 31, 2004. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, Items in Consolidated Statements of Earnings As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 8.2 % 0.5 % Cost of merchandise sold 62.2 63.8 64.3 5.6 (0.3 ) Gross profit 37.8 36.2 35.7 12.7 1.9 Operating expenses 29.1 27.9 27.2 12.5 3.0 Operating earnings 8.7 8.3 8.5 13.5 (1.5 ) Other income (expense) 0.1 (0.1 ) 0.1 190.9 (231.8 ) Income taxes 3.1 3.3 3.5 2.7 (5.1 ) Cumulative effect of accounting change expense -- -- 0.5 N/A 100.0 Net earnings 5.7 % 4.9 % 4.6 % 26.4 % 7.3 % 2004 Compared to 2003 Grainger net sales for 2004 of $5,049.8 million were up 8.2% versus 2003. The increase in net sales was a result of the strengthening in the manufacturing and commercial sectors. Full year results also benefited from the completion of the logistics network upgrade, which improved product availability, as well as from the launch of the market expansion project, an expanded sales force and new communication technology in the U.S. branches. The increase in net sales was realized in the Branch-based Distribution and Lab Safety segments of the business, while net sales in the Integrated Supply segment were essentially flat year over year. The gross profit margin of 37.8% in 2004 improved 1.6 percentage points over the gross profit margin of 36.2% in 2003, principally due to product cost reduction programs, including the global sourcing of products, combined with selected price increases in 2004 and the positive effect of product mix. These margin improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in selling price category mix. Grainger operating earnings of $439.5 million in 2004 increased $52.3 million, or 13.5%, over the prior year. The operating margin of 8.7% in 2004 improved 0.4 percentage point over 2003, as the combined effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses were up 12.5% in 2004 principally due to higher variable compensation and benefits associated with the improved performance for the year, as well as to incremental costs related to the market expansion and information technology programs. In 2004, net earnings of $286.9 million increased $60.0 million, or 26.4%, over the prior year. The growth in net earnings was due to the improvement in operating earnings, higher interest income and a lower tax rate. Diluted earnings per share for 2004 of $3.13 were 27.2% higher than the $2.46 for 2003. 10 Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Branch-based Distribution Net sales of $4,520.0 million in 2004 increased 8.5% over 2003 net sales of $4,167.2 million. Sales in the United States were up 8.2% over the prior year. All customer segments increased, with the strongest sales growth in the manufacturing and commercial sectors. National account sales, which include all customer segments, were up 12%. Sales to government accounts were up 5% primarily due to increased sales to the U.S. Postal Service and to federal, state and local governments. Sales processed through the grainger.com Web site were $611.3 million for 2004, an increase of 27.7% over 2003. Net sales in Canada were 11.1% higher in 2004 than in 2003, benefiting primarily from a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In local currency, sales increased 3.3%, primarily due to a strengthening in the Canadian economy in the second half of the year driven by the natural resources sector. Sales in Mexico were up 15.4% in 2004 as compared to 2003, driven by an improving local economy, expanded telesales operations and several branch facility enhancements during the year. Cost of merchandise sold of $2,778.2 million increased $148.6 million, or 5.6%, over 2003 due to increased volume, while gross profit margins improved 1.6 percentage points to 38.5% in 2004 from 36.9% in 2003. Contributing to the improvement in gross profit margin were product cost reduction programs, which included the global sourcing of additional products, combined with selected price increases and the positive effect of product mix. These margin improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in selling price category mix. Operating expenses for the Branch-based Distribution businesses increased 11.6% in 2004. Operating expenses were up primarily as a result of higher sales commissions and bonus and profit sharing accruals associated with the improved 2004 performance, as well as increased costs related to strategic initiatives such as the market expansion program and technology upgrades. Partially offsetting these increases was improved productivity achieved from the redesigned logistics network. In 2004, operating earnings of $461.4 million increased by $71.2 million, or 18.2%, over 2003. The effect of sales growth, combined with the improvement in gross profit margin, more than offset the increase in operating expenses. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety were $336.7 million in 2004, an increase of $31.2 million, or 10.2%, when compared with $305.5 million of sales in 2003. Higher sales were principally driven by growth in nonsafety products. Sales through Lab Safety Web sites were up 26.1% in 2004 over 2003. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase were incremental sales from Gempler s, which was acquired on April 14, 2003. Excluding Gempler s, sales increased 6.1% over 2003. The gross profit margin of 41.8% decreased 0.4 percentage point when compared to the gross profit margin of 42.2% for 2003. Contributing to the decline was the negative effect of selling price category mix combined with the effect of a full year of Gempler sales which carry a lower gross profit margin. Operating expenses were $95.3 million in 2004, up $8.4 million, or 9.6%, over 2003. The increase over the prior year was principally driven by higher variable compensation expense related to the strong performance for the year, higher catalog media costs and higher benefits expenses from increases in healthcare costs. Also contributing to the increase were costs associated with Gempler for a full year in 2004 versus a partial year in 2003. Operating earnings of $45.5 million were up 8.6% in 2004 over 2003, resulting primarily from the increase in sales, partially offset by the lower gross profit margin and increased operating expenses. Integrated Supply Integrated Supply net sales of $211.1 million in 2004 were down $0.6 million, or essentially flat when compared with 2003. Incremental sales at ten new customer locations were more than offset by the disengagement of two large customers late in 2003, lower sales to two large customers and lower management fees. Sales included both product sales, which are passed through to the customer at cost, and management fees. Gross profit declined $0.8 million in 2004 and the gross profit margin of 11.6% declined 0.3 percentage point from 11.9% in 2003. The primary driver of these declines was lower management fees. Operating expenses decreased slightly in 2004, down 0.5%, principally due to a reduction in data processing costs and related contract services. Operating earnings of $2.5 million for 2004 for Integrated Supply declined $0.7 million, or 23.1%, compared to $3.2 million in 2003. 11 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $5.6 million of income in 2004, an improvement of $11.8 million as compared with $6.2 million of expense in 2003. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 (In thousands of dollars) Other income and (expense) Interest income (expense) net $ 1,988 $ (2,668 ) Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities net 996 (2,288 ) Gain on sale of unconsolidated entity 750 -- Write-off of investments in unconsolidated entities -- (1,921 ) Unclassified net: Gains on sales of investment securities 50 1,208 Write-down of investment securities -- (1,614 ) Gains (losses) on sales of fixed assets net 1,725 1,607 Other 100 (495 ) $ 5,609 $ (6,171 ) The improvement in other income and expense in 2004 over 2003 was primarily attributable to net interest income in 2004 versus net interest expense in 2003, as well as a $3.3 million improvement in the results of unconsolidated entities. The change to net interest income in 2004 from net interest expense in 2003 was due to the combination of higher interest rates and invested balances, together with the reduction in outstanding long-term debt balances. Additionally, 2003 included $1.9 million in expense for the write-off of investments in two Asian joint ventures and $1.6 million in expense for the write-down of investment securities. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income taxes of $158.2 million in 2004 increased 2.7% as compared with $154.1 million in 2003. Grainger effective tax rates were 35.5% and 40.4% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Excluding the effect of equity in unconsolidated entities and the write-off of these investments, which are recorded net of tax, the effective income tax rates were 35.6% for 2004 and 40.0% for 2003. The tax rate reduction was primarily due to a lower tax rate in Canada, as well as the realization of tax benefits related to operations in Mexico and to capital losses, the recognition of tax benefits from the Medicare Act and the resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies. For 2005, Grainger is projecting its estimated effective tax rate to be 37.0%, excluding the effects of equity in unconsolidated entities. 2003 Compared to 2002 Grainger net sales of $4,667.0 million for 2003 were essentially flat compared to 2002. Full-year results were affected by the general weakness in the U.S. economy. Sales in the Branch-based Distribution business segment increased $19.2 million over 2002, or 0.5%, generally unchanged year over year. Revenue increased in the Lab Safety segment, while sales for Integrated Supply declined. Despite the limited sales growth experienced during the year, gross profit margins improved in 2003 to 36.2% from 35.7%, principally due to favorable changes in product mix and selected price increases designed to offset increased freight and other costs. Grainger operating earnings of $387.3 million in 2003 decreased 1.5% from the prior year. Operating margins declined to 8.3% in 2003 from 8.5% in 2002 reflecting higher operating expenses year over year. The principal driver of the operating expense increase was higher severance and healthcare expenses. Grainger net earnings of $227.0 million in 2003 increased $15.4 million, or 7.3%, as compared with 2002 net earnings of $211.6 million. Diluted earnings per share for the year increased to $2.46 in 2003 from $2.24 in 2002. In 2002, Grainger recorded a $23.9 million after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The results for 2002 also included an after-tax gain of $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, from the reduction of restructuring reserves established for the shutdown of Material Logic. 12 Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Branch-based Distribution Net sales at the Branch-based Distribution businesses totaled $4,167.2 million in 2003 and were essentially flat when compared with 2002 sales of $4,148.0 million. Sales in the United States declined approximately 1% in 2003 as compared with 2002. Government account sales were up nearly 11% in 2003, while all other customer segments, including light and heavy manufacturing, were down when compared with 2002. The declines noted in the other customer segments were primarily due to the weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly in manufacturing. Within these customer segments, sales to national accounts increased approximately 2% over 2002. Sales growth through Internet channels continued in 2003, 15.9% over 2002 and represented 12.6% of segment sales. Sales in Canada increased 15.4% in 2003, principally due to a favorable exchange rate. In local currency, sales grew 2.7%, primarily in Ontario and national accounts. In Mexico, sales declined 3.7% in 2003 as compared with 2002, principally due to a weak economy in Mexico. Cost of merchandise sold of $2,629.7 million for 2003 in the Branch-based Distribution businesses was essentially flat compared to $2,638.6 million in 2002. Gross profit margins increased 0.5 percentage point to 36.9% in 2003 from 36.4% in 2002. Selected price increases designed to offset increased freight and other costs both in the United States and Canada, combined with a favorable change in product mix, contributed to the margin increase. Branch-based Distribution operating expenses increased 2.9% in 2003, primarily due to higher severance and healthcare expenses and increased occupancy costs. Operating earnings of $390.2 million in 2003 declined by $4.7 million, or 1.2%, as compared with 2002. The increase in operating expenses year over year more than offset the improvement in gross profit margin. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety increased by $18.7 million to $305.5 million in 2003, a 6.5% increase over 2002. The sales growth was attributable to incremental sales from Gempler s, acquired on April 14, 2003. Excluding the results of Gempler s, year-over-year net sales decreased 2.0% as a result of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy. A major portion of Lab Safety sales are to manufacturers. The overall decline in the manufacturing sector was partially offset by increased sales to customers in the forestry and public safety markets. The gross profit margin of 42.2% decreased 0.7 percentage point due to incremental sales of Gempler products, which have lower gross margins than the rest of Lab Safety products. In addition, in 2003 there was a shift in sales mix to lower margin new product sales. Lab Safety operating expenses of $87.0 million increased 14.6% in 2003, when compared with $75.9 million for 2002. The primary driver of the year-over-year increase was the incremental costs associated with the addition of Gempler during the year and higher spending on catalog media. As a result, operating earnings of $41.9 million for Lab Safety in 2003 declined 11.1% from operating earnings of $47.1 million in 2002. Integrated Supply Integrated Supply net sales of $211.7 million in 2003 were $14.3 million lower than $226.0 million of net sales in 2002. The 6.3% decrease in net sales resulted from six site disengagements, as well as lower volumes from existing customers. The decrease in sales was partially offset by incremental sales at seven new customer sites. Sales included both product sales, which are passed through to the customer at cost, and management fees. Gross profit declined $1.9 million in 2003 due to lower management fees. Operating expenses of $22.1 million increased 5.4% in 2003, when compared with $21.0 million for 2002. The increase of $1.1 million was principally due to a higher provision for bad debts, combined with incremental costs associated with a systems upgrade. Operating earnings of $3.2 million in 2003 for Integrated Supply declined $3.0 million from operating earnings of $6.2 million in 2002. 13 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $6.2 million of expense in 2003, an unfavorable change of $10.9 million as compared with $4.7 million of income in 2002. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (In thousands of dollars) Other income and (expense) Interest income (expense) net $ (2,668 ) $ (1,590 ) Equity in loss of unconsolidated entities net (2,288 ) (3,025 ) Write-off of investments in unconsolidated entities (1,921 ) -- Unclassified net: Gains on sales of investment securities 1,208 7,308 Write-off of investment securities (1,614 ) (3,192 ) Gains (losses) on sales of fixed assets net 1,607 5,219 Other (495 ) (38 ) $ (6,171 ) $ 4,682 In the fourth quarter of 2003, Grainger wrote off its investment in two Asian joint ventures resulting in an after-tax charge to earnings of $1.9 million. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The reduction in gains on sales of fixed assets resulted from the sale of one facility in 2003 versus two in 2002. Income Taxes Income taxes of $154.1 million in 2003 declined 5.1% as compared with $162.3 million in 2002. Grainger effective tax rates were 40.4% and 40.8% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Excluding the effect of the equity losses in unconsolidated entities and the write-off of these investments, which did not result in tax benefits, the effective income tax rates were 40.0% for 2003 and 40.5% for 2002. This change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower nondeductible losses in Mexico and a lower tax rate in Canada. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2002, Grainger adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In the second quarter of 2002, Grainger completed the initial process of evaluating goodwill for impairment under SFAS No. 142. Fair values of reporting units were estimated using a present value method that discounted future cash flows. When available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples were used to corroborate results of the discounted cash flows. As a result of the application of the impairment methodology introduced by SFAS No. 142, Grainger recorded a noncash charge to earnings of $32.3 million ($23.9 million after-tax, or $0.26 per diluted share) related to the write-down of goodwill of its Canadian subsidiary, Acklands. Previous accounting rules required a comparison of book value to undiscounted cash flows, whereas the new rules require a comparison of book value to discounted cash flows, which are lower. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 14 Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position and cash flows from operations to continue, allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives and capital expenditures, as well as the payment of long-term debt, the repurchases of shares and the payment of cash dividends at or above historical levels. Cash Flow Net cash flows from operations of $406.5 million in 2004, $394.1 million in 2003 and $303.5 million in 2002 continued to improve Grainger financial position and serve as the primary source of funding. Net cash provided by operations increased $12.4 million in 2004 over 2003 driven primarily by increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisition and joint venture contributions generated cash of $8.3 million in 2004. Trade accounts payable increased due to higher inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2004. Increases in profit sharing and bonus accruals, driven by an improved 2004 performance, resulted in an increase in other current liabilities. These changes were essentially offset by increases in inventory, as well as trade accounts receivable, which were up due to higher December sales. The increase in net cash flows from operations from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to increased net earnings and an improvement in working capital management. A reduction in inventory, resulting from efficiencies realized from the redesigned logistics network, was partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable from lower inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of 2003. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $142.4 million, $105.3 million and $105.8 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital expenditures for property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software were $160.8 million, $80.5 million and $144.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. In 2003, Grainger also funded $36.7 million to purchase Gempler s, which is part of the Lab Safety segment. The results of operations for Gempler have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date of April 14, 2003. Net cash flows used in financing activities for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $240.6 million, $97.9 million and $158.1 million, respectively. During 2004, Grainger liquidated its cross-currency swap and related commercial paper debt with payments totaling $140.8 million. Grainger funding of treasury stock purchases increased $59.7 million in 2004, as Grainger repurchased 2,001,000 shares in 2004, compared with 918,300 shares in 2003. Treasury stock purchases were 2,221,500 in 2002. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 7.1 million shares of common stock remained available under Grainger repurchase authorization. Dividends paid to shareholders were $71.2 million in 2004, $67.3 million in 2003 and $66.5 million in 2002. Partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds from stock options exercised of $72.3 million, $15.2 million and $17.1 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Working Capital Internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition, funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital was $1,092.3 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $926.8 million at December 31, 2003, and $898.7 million at December 31, 2002. At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6, 2.3 and 2.5, respectively. The current ratio increased in 2004 principally due to Grainger liquidation of the cross-currency swap and related commercial paper debt that had been classified in current liabilities in 2003. Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table: For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands of dollars) Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 41,929 $ 24,960 $ 61,083 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 86,347 49,104 72,895 Subtotal 128,276 74,064 133,978 Capitalized software 32,482 6,422 10,047 Total $ 160,758 $ 80,486 $ 144,025 In 2004, Grainger investments included the market expansion program, which is designed to re-align branches in several metropolitan markets, ongoing SAP initiatives, an upgrade of the branch communication systems and expenditures related to Canadian branch and systems projects. Capital expenditures in 2003 related to Grainger investment in its logistics network, which was completed in March 2004, spending for information technology upgrades, as well as the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. Capital spending in 2002 reflects incremental spending for the logistics network project that began in 2000. 15 Capital expenditures are expected to range between $150 to $180 million in 2005 and include investments for the ongoing market expansion program, information technology and Canadian branch programs, as well as other general projects including the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger believes that cash flows from operations will remain strong and expects to fund the 2005 capital investments from existing working capital. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit. At December 31, 2004, Grainger long-term debt rating by Standard & Poor was AA+. Grainger available lines of credit, as further discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were $250.0 million, $265.4 million and $264.7 million, as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 0.5%, 7.5% and 7.2% as of the same dates. In September 2002, Grainger received net proceeds of $113.7 million from the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds were used to repay outstanding long-term debt in the amount of C$180.4 million. The long-term debt that was repaid with the proceeds of the commercial paper issuance had been designated by Grainger as a nonderivative hedge of Grainger net investment in its Canadian subsidiary. Grainger entered into a two-year cross-currency swap on September 25, 2002, which replaced the Canadian dollar long-term debt as a hedge of the net investment in Grainger Canadian subsidiary. The counterparty to the financial instrument was an investment grade financial institution. Grainger did not incur any loss from nonperformance by this counterparty. Since Grainger had the ability to refinance the commercial paper with debt having a longer maturity, and its intent was to keep the debt outstanding for the two-year period of the cross-currency swap, the commercial paper was originally classified as long-term debt. At December 31, 2003, Grainger had not determined if it would renew the cross-currency swap when it came due in 2004 and as a result the commercial paper debt was classified as Current maturities of long-term debt. On September 27, 2004, the cross-currency swap and related commercial paper debt matured and were liquidated with payments totaling $140.8 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. Holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require Grainger to redeem these bonds, thus they are classified as Current maturities of long-term debt. Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2004, Grainger contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (In thousands of dollars) Long-term debt obligations $ 9,485 $ 9,485 $ -- $ -- $ -- Capital lease obligations -- -- -- -- -- Operating lease obligations 85,870 22,728 31,190 19,487 12,465 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 48,224 41,954 6,270 -- -- Commitments to purchase inventory 186,391 186,391 -- -- -- Other purchase obligations 115,656 67,799 46,123 1,734 -- Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet -- -- -- -- -- Total $ 445,626 $ 328,357 $ 83,583 $ 21,221 $ 12,465 Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. 16 The Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations table does not include $74.7 million of accrued employment-related benefits costs, of which $45.8 million is related to Grainger postretirement benefits. These amounts are excluded because a portion of the projected benefit payments has already been funded by Grainger and the timing of future funding requirements is not known. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits. Postretirement obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. Changes in assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger postretirement benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. As of December 31, 2004, Grainger reduced the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 6.00% to 5.75% to reflect the decline in interest rates. Grainger estimates that the reduction in the expected discount rate will decrease 2005 pretax earnings by approximately $0.6 million. Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor 500 Index to develop its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2004, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax at 40%) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return. Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. While Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates, and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate, changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience and new trends and therefore, may affect Grainger retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 17 Insurance Reserves. Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve level. The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivable and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivable. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Write-offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends. Inventory Reserves. Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. Actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates affecting Grainger inventory values and cost of merchandise sold. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on Grainger results of operations. Income Taxes. Grainger accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities. Future tax authorities rulings and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. Other. Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies relating to revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long-lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. 18 Forward-Looking Statements This document contains forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. The forward-looking statements relate to Grainger expected future financial results and business plans, strategies and objectives and are not historical facts. They are often identified by qualifiers such as will, expects, intends, is likely, anticipated, scheduled, believes, positioned to, continue, estimates, forecast, predicting, projection, potential, assumption or similar expressions. There are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause Grainger results to differ materially from what is projected. Factors that may affect forward-looking statements include the following: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; increased competitive pricing pressure on Grainger businesses; failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; changes in laws and regulations; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance. Trends and projections could also be affected by general industry and market conditions, gross domestic product growth rates, general economic conditions including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, global and other conflicts, employment levels and other factors.
