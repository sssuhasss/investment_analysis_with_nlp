Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current plans, expectations and beliefs about future events. In light of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors discussed in this section, there are risks that our actual experience will differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward-looking statements in this section and throughout this report. For more information regarding what constitutes a forward-looking statement, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Corporation, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, operates in 29 states, the District of Columbia and 44 foreign countries. The Corporation provides a diversified range of banking and nonbanking financial services and products domestically and internationally through four business segments: Global Consumer and Small Business Banking , Global Business and Financial Services , Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking , and Global Wealth and Investment Management. At December 31, 2005, we had $1.3 trillion in assets and approximately 177,000 full-time equivalent employees. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition are incorporated by reference into Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Restatement As discussed in Notes 1 and 23 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are restating our historical financial statements for the years 2004 and 2003, for the quarters in 2005 and 2004, and other selected financial data for the years 2002 and 2001 (see Tables 2 and 3 on pages 23 and 25 for the restatements of Five-Year Summary of Selected Financial Data, and Supplemental Financial Data and Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures). These restatements and resulting revisions relate to the accounting treatment for certain derivative transactions under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). The Corporation is presenting this restatement in its 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation uses interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts in its Asset and Liability Management (ALM) process. Use of such derivatives enables us to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate and currency rate volatility. The Corporation had applied hedge accounting for certain derivative transactions that we believe met the requirements of SFAS 133. The application of hedge accounting produced financial statement results that were consistent with the economics of these transactions and our risk management activities. Hedge accounting reduces volatility in earnings by counterbalancing the changes in the hedged item and the derivative. As a result of a recent interpretation on the shortcut method for derivative instruments under SFAS 133, the Corporation undertook a review of all hedge accounting transactions, which was completed in the first quarter of 2006. Based on the review, we determined that certain hedges did not meet the requirements of SFAS 133. Since we could not apply hedge accounting for those transactions, the derivative transactions have been marked to market through our Consolidated Statement of Income with no related offset for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in interest rates and currency rates which impact the fair value of derivative instruments have had a direct impact on our Net Income. 12 Table of Contents The following tables set forth the effect of the adjustments described above on Net Income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and for the quarterly periods in 2005 and 2004. Although the year and fourth quarter of 2005 are not restated, this information was previously provided in the Corporation current report on Form 8-K filed on January 23, 2006, and therefore, is included as part of the restatement information.

(2) For presentation purposes, certain numbers have been rounded. (3) The Corporation provided unaudited financial information relating to the fourth quarter of 2005 in its current report on Form 8-K filed on January 23, 2006. During the first quarter of 2006, the Corporation terminated certain derivatives used as economic hedges as part of the ALM process that did not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting and entered into new derivative contracts to hedge certain of its exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. These new contracts are designated in hedging relationships and meet the requirement for SFAS 133 hedge accounting. Prior to the termination of the economic hedges noted above, the changes in fair value of such contracts were recorded in Other Income and had a direct impact on Net Income. As a result, we estimate that Net Income will be reduced by approximately $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2006. 13 Table of Contents Effects of the Restatement The following tables set forth the effects of the restatement relating to derivative transactions on major caption items within our Consolidated Statement of Income for the years 2004 and 2003, and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004. Although the year and fourth quarter of 2005 are not restated, this information was previously provided in the Corporation current report on Form 8-K filed on January 23, 2006, and therefore, is included as part of the restatement information. Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statement of Income Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in millions, except per share information) As Previously Reported (1) Restated As Previously Reported Restated As Previously Reported Restated Total interest income $ 58,696 $ 58,626 $ 43,224 $ 42,953 $ 31,563 $ 31,172 Total interest expense 27,540 27,889 14,430 14,993 10,099 10,667 Net interest income 31,156 30,737 28,794 27,960 21,464 20,505 Total noninterest income 25,610 25,354 20,085 21,005 16,450 17,329 Total revenue 56,766 56,091 48,879 48,965 37,914 37,834 Gains on sales of debt securities 1,084 1,084 2,123 1,724 941 941 Income before income taxes 25,155 24,480 21,221 20,908 15,861 15,781 Income tax expense 8,269 8,015 7,078 6,961 5,051 5,019 Net income $ 16,886 $ 16,465 $ 14,143 $ 13,947 $ 10,810 $ 10,762 Net income available to common shareholders $ 16,868 $ 16,447 $ 14,127 $ 13,931 $ 10,806 $ 10,758 Per common share information Earnings $ 4.21 $ 4.10 $ 3.76 $ 3.71 $ 3.63 $ 3.62 Diluted earnings $ 4.15 $ 4.04 $ 3.69 $ 3.64 $ 3.57 $ 3.55 (1) The Corporation provided unaudited financial information relating to 2005 in its current report on Form 8-K filed on January 23, 2006. The impact of the restatement on our Consolidated Statement of Income was to reverse previously applied hedge accounting for affected hedging relationships in the relevant periods. For derivative instruments previously accounted for as fair value hedges, the net accruals for the derivatives were recorded to Net Interest Income, and net changes in fair values of the derivative instruments as a result of changes in rates were recorded as basis adjustments to the hedged items, such as Loans and Leases, and Long-term Debt. As a result of the restatement, the previous accounting treatment was reversed (i.e., the net accruals recorded to Net Interest Income were reversed and there was no basis adjustment for the hedged items), and the total changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments including interest accrual settlements were recorded directly to Other Income. In addition, for derivative instruments that were previously accounted for as cash flow hedges, the Corporation recorded accruals from the derivative instruments to Net Interest Income and recorded net changes in the fair values of the derivatives, net-of-tax, to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). As a result of the restatement, the cash flow hedge effects were reversed from Accumulated OCI and Net Interest Income, and recorded in Other Income. Accordingly, Net Interest Income decreased $419 million, $834 million and $959 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other Income decreased $256 million in 2005, and increased $920 million and $879 million in 2004 and 2003. The change in Other Income (included in Total Noninterest Income) after the restatement adjustments was primarily due to the effects of changes in rates in each respective year on the fair values of derivative instruments used in the ALM process. These derivative instruments were primarily comprised of receive fixed interest rate swaps, long futures and forward contracts, which generally increase in value when interest rates fall, and decrease in value when interest rates rise. Gains on Sales of Debt Securities declined from the previously reported results by $399 million in the third quarter of 2004. The previously reported results did not recognize cash flow hedge losses upon sale of the underlying hedged securities. This cash flow hedge utilized a forward purchase agreement to hedge the variability in cash flows from the anticipated purchase of securities. The Corporation subsequently sold the related securities and did not previously reclassify the loss on the forward purchase agreement from Accumulated OCI into income. 14 Table of Contents Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheet December 31 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) As Previously Reported (1) Restated As Previously Reported Restated Loans and leases, net of allowance for loan and lease losses $ 565,737 $ 565,746 $ 513,211 $ 513,187 Total assets 1,291,795 1,291,803 1,110,457 1,110,432 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 31,749 31,938 41,243 41,590 Long-term debt 101,338 100,848 98,078 97,116 Total liabilities 1,190,571 1,190,270 1,010,812 1,010,197 Retained earnings 67,205 67,552 58,006 58,773 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (7,518 ) (7,556 ) (2,587 ) (2,764 ) Total shareholders equity 101,224 101,533 99,645 100,235 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 1,291,795 $ 1,291,803 $ 1,110,457 $ 1,110,432 (1) The Corporation provided unaudited financial information relating to 2005 in its current report on Form 8-K filed on January 23, 2006. The impact of the restatement on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was to reverse fair value basis adjustments to items that previously qualified as fair value hedged items such as Loans and Leases, and Long-term Debt. Additionally, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that previously qualified for cash flow hedge accounting were reversed from Accumulated OCI and recorded in income. Tax effects of these adjustments impacted Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, this resulted in an increase of $9 million and a decrease of $24 million in Loans and Leases, an increase in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities of $189 million and $347 million, a decrease in Long-term Debt of $490 million and $962 million, an increase in Retained Earnings of $347 million and $767 million, and a decrease in Accumulated OCI of $38 million and $177 million. The following tables set forth the effects of the restatement relating to derivative transactions on major caption items within our Consolidated Statement of Income and our Consolidated Balance Sheet for the quarters in 2005 and 2004. Although the year and fourth quarter of 2005 are not restated, this information was previously provided in the Corporation current report on Form 8-K filed on January 23, 2006, and therefore, is included as part of the restatement information.

As rates decreased in the third quarter of 2004 and the second quarter of 2005, the Corporation Net Income increased driven by increases in the fair value of these derivative instruments. As rates increased in the first quarter of 2005, the Corporation Net Income decreased as the rise in rates adversely impacted the fair value of the derivative instruments.

This transaction closed on January 1, 2006. Under the terms of the agreement, MBNA stockholders received 0.5009 of a share of our common stock plus $4.125 for each MBNA share of common stock. On June 17, 2005, we announced a definitive agreement to purchase approximately nine percent of the stock of China Construction Bank (CCB) for $3.0 billion. Under this agreement, we made an initial purchase of CCB shares for $2.5 billion in August 2005 and an additional purchase of $500 million in October 2005, during CCB initial public offering. These shares are non-transferable until the third anniversary of the initial public offering. We also hold an option that allows us to increase our interest in CCB to 19.9 percent over the next five years. CCB is the third largest commercial bank in China based on total assets. Effective for the third quarter dividend, our Board of Directors (the Board) increased the quarterly cash dividend 11 percent from $0.45 to $0.50 per common share. In October 2005, the Board declared a fourth quarter cash dividend which was paid on December 23, 2005 to common shareholders of record on December 2, 2005. In January 2006, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per common share payable on March 24, 2006 to shareholders of record on March 3, 2006. On October 15, 2004, we acquired 100 percent of National Processing, Inc. (NPC), for $1.4 billion in cash, creating the second largest merchant processor in the United States. On April 1, 2004, we closed our merger with FleetBoston Financial Corporation (FleetBoston Merger). The merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, results for 2004 include the impact of FleetBoston for nine months of combined company results. Economic Overview In 2005, economic performance was strong, despite a near doubling in energy prices, persistent hikes in the Federal Funds rate and the destructive hurricanes in the second half of 2005. In the United States, real Gross Domestic Product rose a solid 3.6 percent. Global economic expansion was healthy, as robust growth in Asian nations was offset by weaker activity in core European nations. In the U.S., consumer spending was particularly resilient to the higher energy prices that reduced real purchasing power. Rising employment and wages lifted personal income and financial wealth reached an all-time high, while the rate of personal savings fell again. Following several years of robust increases in real estate activity and housing values, real estate softened in the second half of 2005 and the volume of mortgage refinancing receded. Heightened efficiencies generated sustained productivity gains that constrained costs of production and contributed to record-breaking operating profits and cash flows. While business investment spending was strong and employment gains firm, inventories remained lean. The strong business performance generated growth in business lending and supported healthy credit quality. Although the higher energy prices pushed up headline inflation, core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, remained low. The Federal Reserve raised rates at every Federal Open Market Committee meeting in 2005, lifting the Federal Funds rate to 4.25 percent at year-end. However, these rate hikes were widely anticipated, contributing to very low bond yields and a significantly flatter yield curve. 17 Table of Contents Performance Overview Net Income totaled $16.5 billion, or $4.04 per diluted common share in 2005, increases of 18 percent and 11 percent from $13.9 billion, or $3.64 per diluted common share in 2004. Business Segment Total Revenue and Net Income Total Revenue Net Income (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 (Restated) 2005 2004 (Restated) Global Consumer and Small Business Banking $ 28,876 $ 25,156 $ 7,156 $ 5,971 Global Business and Financial Services 11,160 9,251 4,562 3,844 Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking 9,009 9,046 1,736 1,924 Global Wealth and Investment Management 7,393 5,933 2,388 1,605 All Other 485 296 623 603 Total FTE basis (1) 56,923 49,682 16,465 13,947 FTE adjustment (1) (832 ) (717 ) Total $ 56,091 $ 48,965 $ 16,465 $ 13,947 (1) Total revenue for the segments and All Other is on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. For more information on a FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 24. Global Consumer and Small Business Banking Net Income increased $1.2 billion, or 20 percent, to $7.2 billion in 2005. Driving the increase was the impact of FleetBoston, which contributed to increases in Net Interest Income, Card Income and Service Charges. Also impacting the increase in Net Income was higher Mortgage Banking Income driven by lower MSR impairment charges. Partially offsetting these increases was higher Provision for Credit Losses and Noninterest Expense. For more information on Global Consumer and Small Business Banking , see page 28. Global Business and Financial Services Net Income increased $718 million, or 19 percent, to $4.6 billion in 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher Net Interest Income as Average Loans and Leases, and Average Deposits increased. Also driving the increase in Net Income was higher other noninterest income, Service Charges and the impact of FleetBoston. Offsetting these increases were higher Noninterest Expense and a reduced benefit from Provision for Credit Losses. For more information on Global Business and Financial Services , see page 34. Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking Net Income decreased $188 million, or 10 percent, to $1.7 billion in 2005. The decrease was driven by lower trading-related Net Interest Income and Service Charges, and a reduced benefit from Provision for Credit Losses partially offset by higher Trading Account Profits, Equity Investment Gains, and Investment and Brokerage Services Income. For more information on Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking , see page 35. Global Wealth and Investment Management Net Income increased $783 million, or 49 percent, to $2.4 billion in 2005. The increase was due to higher Net Interest Income as we experienced increases in Average Deposits, and Average Loans and Leases driven by the impact of FleetBoston. Also impacting the increase in Net Income was higher Investment and Brokerage Services Income. Partially offsetting these increases was higher Personnel Expense. Total assets under management increased $30.9 billion to $482.4 billion at December 31, 2005. For more information on Global Wealth and Investment Management , see page 38. All Other Net Income increased $20 million, or three percent, to $623 million in 2005. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in Equity Investment Gains offset by a decrease in Gains on Sales of Debt Securities and Other Income. Other Income decreased primarily as a result of negative changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, which do not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting, due to increasing rates during 2005. For more information on All Other , see page 40. 18 Table of Contents Financial Highlights Net Interest Income Net Interest Income on a FTE basis increased $2.9 billion to $31.6 billion in 2005 compared to 2004. The primary drivers of the increase were the FleetBoston Merger, organic growth in consumer (primarily credit card and home equity) and commercial loans, higher domestic deposit levels and a larger ALM portfolio (primarily securities). Partially offsetting these increases was the adverse impact of spread compression due to the flattening of the yield curve, which contributed to lower Net Interest Income. The net interest yield on a FTE basis declined 33 basis points (bps) to 2.84 percent in 2005. This was primarily due to the adverse impact of an increase in lower-yielding, trading-related balances and spread compression, which was partially offset by growth in core deposit and consumer loans. For more information on Net Interest Income on a FTE basis, see Table I on page 80. Noninterest Income Noninterest Income (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 (Restated) Service charges $ 7,704 $ 6,989 Investment and brokerage services 4,184 3,614 Mortgage banking income 805 414 Investment banking income 1,856 1,886 Equity investment gains 2,040 863 Card income 5,753 4,592 Trading account profits 1,812 869 Other income 1,200 1,778 Total noninterest income $ 25,354 $ 21,005 Noninterest Income increased $4.3 billion to $25.4 billion for 2005 compared to 2004, due to the following which includes the impact of FleetBoston: Service Charges grew $715 million driven by organic account growth. Investment and Brokerage Services increased $570 million due to increases in asset management fees and mutual fund fees. Mortgage Banking Income increased $391 million due to lower MSR impairment charges which were partially offset by lower production income. Equity Investment Gains increased $1.2 billion, primarily in Principal Investing, as liquidity in the private equity markets increased. Card Income increased $1.2 billion due to increased interchange income and merchant discount fees driven by growth in debit and credit purchase volumes and the acquisition of NPC. Trading Account Profits increased $943 million due to increased customer activity driven by our strategic initiative in Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking to expand business capabilities and opportunities, and the absence of a writedown of the Excess Spread Certificates (the Certificates) that occurred in the prior year. For more information on the Certificates, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Income decreased $578 million primarily related to losses on derivative instruments used as economic hedges in the ALM process that did not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting. Provision for Credit Losses The Provision for Credit Losses increased $1.2 billion to $4.0 billion in 2005 with credit card being the primary driver of the increase. Consumer credit card net charge-offs increased $1.3 billion from 2004 to $3.7 billion with an estimated $578 million related to the increase in bankruptcy filings prior to the effective date of the new bankruptcy legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2005. We estimate that approximately 70 percent of these bankruptcy-related charge-offs represent acceleration from 2006 and were provided for previously. Also impacting credit card net charge-offs and the Provision for Credit Losses were organic growth and seasoning of the portfolio, the impact of the FleetBoston portfolio and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts. The provision also increased as the rate of credit quality improvement slowed in the commercial portfolio and a $50 million reserve was established for estimated losses associated with Hurricane Katrina. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in the reserves of $250 million due to reduced uncertainties resulting from the completion of credit-related integration activities for FleetBoston. 19 Table of Contents For more information on credit quality, see Credit Risk Management beginning on page 49. Gains on Sales of Debt Securities Gains on Sales of Debt Securities in 2005 were $1.1 billion compared to $1.7 billion in 2004.

Pre-tax cost savings from the FleetBoston Merger included in the above were $909 million in 2004 and $1.9 billion in 2005, which exceeded the $1.6 billion estimate in the October 2003 FleetBoston Merger announcement. Income Tax Expense Income Tax Expense was $8.0 billion in 2005, reflecting an effective tax rate of 32.7 percent. The effective tax rate was lower than 2004 primarily as a result of a tax benefit of $70 million related to the special one-time deduction associated with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In 2004, Income Tax Expense was $7.0 billion, reflecting an effective tax rate of 33.3 percent. For more information on Income Tax Expense, see Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Table of Contents Balance Sheet Analysis Table 1 Selected Balance Sheet Data December 31 Average Balance (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 (Restated) 2005 2004 (Restated) Assets Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell $ 149,785 $ 91,360 $ 169,132 $ 128,981 Trading account assets 131,707 93,587 133,502 104,616 Securities: Available-for-sale 221,556 194,743 219,651 149,628 Held-to-maturity 47 330 192 543 Loans and leases, net of allowance for loan and lease losses 565,746 513,187 528,793 464,408 All other assets 222,962 217,225 218,622 196,455 Total assets $ 1,291,803 $ 1,110,432 $ 1,269,892 $ 1,044,631 Liabilities Deposits $ 634,670 $ 618,570 $ 632,432 $ 551,559 Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 240,655 119,741 230,751 165,218 Trading account liabilities 50,890 36,654 57,689 35,326 Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings 116,269 78,598 95,657 62,347 Long-term debt 100,848 97,116 97,709 92,303 All other liabilities 46,938 59,518 55,793 53,063 Total liabilities 1,190,270 1,010,197 1,170,031 959,816 Shareholders equity 101,533 100,235 99,861 84,815 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 1,291,803 $ 1,110,432 $ 1,269,892 $ 1,044,631 Balance Sheet Overview At December 31, 2005, Total Assets were $1.3 trillion, an increase of $181.4 billion, or 16 percent, from December 31, 2004. Average Total Assets in 2005 increased $225.3 billion, or 22 percent, from 2004. Growth in Total Assets (both period end and average balances) in 2005 was attributable to increases in various line items primarily driven by an increase in trading-related activity due to the strategic growth initiative, growth in the ALM portfolio and growth in Loans and Leases. Average Total Assets also increased due to the impact of the FleetBoston Merger. At December 31, 2005, Total Liabilities were $1.2 trillion, an increase of $180.1 billion, or 18 percent, from December 31, 2004. Average Total Liabilities in 2005 increased $210.2 billion, or 22 percent, from 2004. Growth in Total Liabilities (both period end and average balances) in 2005 was primarily due to increases in trading-related liabilities due to the strategic growth initiative, increase in wholesale funding and organic growth in core deposits. Average Total Liabilities also increased due to the impact of the FleetBoston Merger. Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell The Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell average balance increased $40.2 billion to $169.1 billion in 2005 from activities in the trading businesses as a result of expanded trading activities related to the strategic initiative and to meet a variety of customers needs. Trading Account Assets Our Trading Account Assets consist primarily of fixed income securities (including government and corporate debt), equity and convertible instruments. The average balance increased $28.9 billion to $133.5 billion in 2005, which was due to growth in client-driven market-making activities in interest rate, credit and equity products, and an increase in proprietary trading activities. For additional information, see Market Risk Management beginning on page 65. Securities AFS Securities include fixed income securities such as mortgage-backed securities, foreign debt, asset-backed securities, municipal debt, equity instruments, U.S. Government agencies and corporate debt. We use the AFS portfolio 21 Table of Contents primarily to manage interest rate risk, liquidity risk and regulatory capital, and to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically attractive returns on these investments. The average balance in the AFS portfolio grew by $70.0 billion from 2004 primarily due to the reinvestment of available liquidity and as part of our ALM strategy. For additional information, see Market Risk Management beginning on page 66. Loans and Leases, Net of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Average Loans and Leases, net of allowance for loan and lease losses, were $528.8 billion in 2005, an increase of 14 percent from 2004. The increase of $40.0 billion in the consumer loan and lease portfolio and $24.6 billion in the commercial loan and lease portfolio was primarily due to organic loan growth. Average Loans and Leases, net of allowance for loan and lease losses, also increased due to the impact of the FleetBoston Merger. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, see Credit Risk Management beginning on page 49, and Notes 7 and 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deposits Average Deposits increased $80.9 billion to $632.4 billion in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a $46.3 billion increase in average domestic interest-bearing deposits and a $24.1 billion increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits primarily due to organic growth including the impact of FleetBoston. We categorize our deposits as core or market-based deposits. Core deposits are generally customer-based and represent a stable, low-cost funding source that usually reacts more slowly to interest rate changes than market-based deposits. Core deposits include savings, NOW and money market accounts, consumer CDs and IRAs, and noninterest-bearing deposits. Core deposits exclude negotiable CDs, public funds, other domestic time deposits and foreign interest-bearing deposits. Average core deposits increased $69.5 billion to $563.6 billion in 2005, a 14 percent increase from the prior year. The increase was distributed between consumer CDs, noninterest-bearing deposits, NOW and money market deposits, and savings. Average market-based deposit funding increased $11.4 billion to $68.8 billion in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $10.5 billion increase in foreign interest-bearing deposits. Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase The Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase average balance increased $65.5 billion to $230.8 billion in 2005 as a result of expanded trading activities related to the strategic initiative and investor client activities. Trading Account Liabilities Our Trading Account Liabilities consist primarily of short positions in fixed income securities (including government and corporate debt), equity and convertible instruments. The average balance increased $22.4 billion to $57.7 billion in 2005, which was due to growth in client-driven market-making activities in interest rate, credit and equity products, and an increase in proprietary trading activities. For additional information, see Market Risk Management beginning on page 66. Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings provide a funding source to supplement Deposits in our ALM strategy. The average balance increased $33.3 billion to $95.7 billion in 2005 due to funding needs associated with the growth of core asset portfolios, primarily Loans and Leases, and AFS Securities. 22 Table of Contents Table 2 Five-Year Summary of Selected Financial Data (1) (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2005 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) 2001 (Restated) Income statement Net interest income $ 30,737 $ 27,960 $ 20,505 $ 20,117 $ 19,904 Noninterest income 25,354 21,005 17,329 14,874 15,863 Total revenue 56,091 48,965 37,834 34,991 35,767 Provision for credit losses 4,014 2,769 2,839 3,697 4,287 Gains on sales of debt securities 1,084 1,724 941 630 475 Noninterest expense 28,681 27,012 20,155 18,445 20,709 Income before income taxes 24,480 20,908 15,781 13,479 11,246 Income tax expense 8,015 6,961 5,019 3,926 3,747 Net income 16,465 13,947 10,762 9,553 7,499 Average common shares issued and outstanding (in thousands) 4,008,688 3,758,507 2,973,407 3,040,085 3,189,914 Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding (in thousands) 4,068,140 3,823,943 3,030,356 3,130,935 3,251,308 Performance ratios Return on average assets 1.30 % 1.34 % 1.44 % 1.46 % 1.16 % Return on average common shareholders equity 16.51 16.47 21.50 19.96 15.42 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (2) 34.03 32.59 29.20 27.53 23.51 Total ending equity to total ending assets 7.86 9.03 6.76 7.92 7.92 Total average equity to total average assets 7.86 8.12 6.69 7.33 7.55 Dividend payout 46.61 46.31 39.76 38.79 48.40 Per common share data Earnings $ 4.10 $ 3.71 $ 3.62 $ 3.14 $ 2.35 Diluted earnings 4.04 3.64 3.55 3.05 2.30 Dividends paid 1.90 1.70 1.44 1.22 1.14 Book value 25.32 24.70 16.86 17.04 15.63 Average balance sheet Total loans and leases $ 537,218 $ 472,617 $ 356,220 $ 336,820 $ 365,447 Total assets 1,269,892 1,044,631 749,104 653,732 644,887 Total deposits 632,432 551,559 406,233 371,479 362,653 Long-term debt 97,709 92,303 67,077 65,550 69,621 Common shareholders equity 99,590 84,584 50,035 47,837 48,610 Total shareholders equity 99,861 84,815 50,091 47,898 48,678 Capital ratios (at year end) Risk-based capital: Tier 1 8.25 % 8.20 % 8.02 % 8.41 % 8.44 % Total 11.08 11.73 12.05 12.63 12.81 Leverage 5.91 5.89 5.86 6.44 6.67 Market price per share of common stock Closing $ 46.15 $ 46.99 $ 40.22 $ 34.79 $ 31.48 High closing 47.08 47.44 41.77 38.45 32.50 Low closing 41.57 38.96 32.82 27.08 23.38 (1) As a result of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, we no longer amortize Goodwill.

MBNA Merger Overview Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 30, 2005, by and between the Corporation and MBNA (the MBNA Merger Agreement), the Corporation acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of MBNA on January 1, 2006. The MBNA Merger was a tax-free merger for the Corporation. The acquisition expands the Corporation customer base and its opportunity to deepen customer relationships across the full breadth of the company by delivering innovative deposit, lending and investment products and services to MBNA customer base. Additionally, the acquisition allows the Corporation to significantly increase its affinity relationships through MBNA credit card operations. MBNA results of operations will be included in the Corporation results beginning January 1, 2006. The transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the MBNA Merger date. Under the terms of the MBNA Merger Agreement, MBNA stockholders received 0.5009 of a share of the Corporation common stock plus $4.125 for each MBNA share of common stock. As provided by the MBNA Merger 23 Table of Contents Agreement, approximately 1.3 billion shares of MBNA common stock were exchanged for approximately 631 million shares of the Corporation common stock. At the date of the MBNA Merger, this represented approximately 16 percent of the Corporation outstanding common stock. MBNA shareholders also received cash of $5.2 billion. On November 3, 2005, MBNA redeemed all shares of its 7 1 / 2 % Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and Series B Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, in accordance with the terms of the MBNA Merger Agreement. Supplemental Financial Data Table 3 provides a reconciliation of the supplemental financial data mentioned below with financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. Operating Basis Presentation In managing our business, we may at times look at performance excluding certain non-recurring items. For example, as an alternative to Net Income, we view results on an operating basis, which represents Net Income excluding Merger and Restructuring Charges. The operating basis of presentation is not defined by GAAP. We believe that the exclusion of Merger and Restructuring Charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful year-to-year comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations. Net Interest Income FTE Basis In addition, we view Net Interest Income and related ratios and analysis (i.e. efficiency ratio, net interest yield and operating leverage) on a FTE basis. Although this is a non-GAAP measure, we believe managing the business with Net Interest Income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, Net Interest Income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in Income Tax Expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of Net Interest Income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Performance Measures As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio, net interest yield, and operating leverage utilize Net Interest Income (and thus Total Revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates how many basis points we are earning over the cost of funds. Operating leverage measures the total percentage revenue growth minus the total percentage expense growth for the corresponding period. During our annual integrated planning process, we set operating leverage and efficiency targets for the Corporation and each line of business. Targets vary by year and by business and are based on a variety of factors, including: maturity of the business, investment appetite, competitive environment, market factors, and other items (e.g. risk appetite). The aforementioned performance measures and ratios, earnings per common share (EPS), return on average assets, return on average common shareholders equity and dividend payout ratio, as well as those measures discussed more fully below, are presented in Table 3. Return on Average Common Shareholders Equity, Return on Average Tangible Common Shareholders Equity and Shareholder Value Added We also evaluate our business based upon return on average common shareholders equity (ROE), return on average tangible common shareholders equity (ROTE) and shareholder value added (SVA) measures. ROE, ROTE and SVA utilize non-GAAP allocation methodologies. ROE measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the Shareholders Equity allocated to that unit. ROTE measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the Shareholders Equity reduced by Goodwill, Core Deposit Intangibles and Other Intangibles, allocated to that unit. SVA is defined as cash basis earnings on an operating basis less a charge for the use of capital. For more information, see Basis of Presentation beginning on page 27. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e. capital) at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation. Using SVA as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments. Investments and initiatives are analyzed using SVA during the annual planning process for maximizing allocation of corporate resources. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use ROE and SVA as key measures to support our overall growth goal. 24 Table of Contents Table 3 Supplemental Financial Data and Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2005 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) 2001 (Restated) Operating basis (1,2) Operating earnings $ 16,740 $ 14,358 $ 10,762 $ 9,553 $ 8,749 Operating earnings per common share 4.17 3.82 3.62 3.14 2.74 Diluted operating earnings per common share 4.11 3.75 3.55 3.05 2.69 Shareholder value added 6,594 5,718 5,475 4,030 3,794 Return on average assets 1.32 % 1.37 % 1.44 % 1.46 % 1.36 % Return on average common shareholders equity 16.79 16.96 21.50 19.96 17.99 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity 34.57 33.51 29.20 27.53 27.02 Operating efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 49.66 53.13 52.38 51.84 53.74 Dividend payout ratio 45.84 44.98 39.76 38.79 41.48 Operating leverage (combined basis) (3) 8.33 0.44 (6.06 ) n/a n/a FTE basis data Net interest income $ 31,569 $ 28,677 $ 21,149 $ 20,705 $ 20,247 Total revenue 56,923 49,682 38,478 35,579 36,110 Net interest yield 2.84 % 3.17 % 3.26 % 3.63 % 3.61 % Efficiency ratio 50.38 54.37 52.38 51.84 57.35 Reconciliation of net income to operating earnings Net income $ 16,465 $ 13,947 $ 10,762 $ 9,553 $ 7,499 Merger and restructuring charges 412 618 1,700 Related income tax benefit (137 ) (207 ) (450 ) Operating earnings $ 16,740 $ 14,358 $ 10,762 $ 9,553 $ 8,749 Reconciliation of EPS to operating EPS Earnings per common share $ 4.10 $ 3.71 $ 3.62 $ 3.14 $ 2.35 Effect of merger and restructuring charges, net of tax benefit 0.07 0.11 0.39 Operating earnings per common share $ 4.17 $ 3.82 $ 3.62 $ 3.14 $ 2.74 Reconciliation of diluted EPS to diluted operating EPS Diluted earnings per common share $ 4.04 $ 3.64 $ 3.55 $ 3.05 $ 2.30 Effect of merger and restructuring charges, net of tax benefit 0.07 0.11 0.39 Diluted operating earnings per common share $ 4.11 $ 3.75 $ 3.55 $ 3.05 $ 2.69 Reconciliation of net income to shareholder value added Net income $ 16,465 $ 13,947 $ 10,762 $ 9,553 $ 7,499 Amortization of intangibles (2) 809 664 217 218 878 Merger and restructuring charges, net of tax benefit 275 411 1,250 Cash basis earnings on an operating basis 17,549 15,022 10,979 9,771 9,627 Capital charge (10,955 ) (9,304 ) (5,504 ) (5,741 ) (5,833 ) Shareholder value added $ 6,594 $ 5,718 $ 5,475 $ 4,030 $ 3,794 Reconciliation of return on average assets to operating return on average assets Return on average assets 1.30 % 1.34 % 1.44 % 1.46 % 1.16 % Effect of merger and restructuring charges, net of tax benefit 0.02 0.03 0.20 Operating return on average assets 1.32 % 1.37 % 1.44 % 1.46 % 1.36 % Reconciliation of return on average common shareholders equity to operating return on average common shareholders equity Return on average common shareholders equity 16.51 % 16.47 % 21.50 % 19.96 % 15.42 % Effect of merger and restructuring charges, net of tax benefit 0.28 0.49 2.57 Operating return on average common shareholders equity 16.79 % 16.96 % 21.50 % 19.96 % 17.99 % Reconciliation of return on average tangible common shareholders equity to operating return on average tangible common shareholders equity Return on average tangible common shareholders equity 34.03 % 32.59 % 29.20 % 27.53 % 23.51 % Effect of merger and restructuring charges, net of tax benefit 0.54 0.92 3.51 Operating return on average tangible common shareholders equity 34.57 % 33.51 % 29.20 % 27.53 % 27.02 % Reconciliation of efficiency ratio to operating efficiency ratio (FTE basis) Efficiency ratio 50.38 % 54.37 % 52.38 % 51.84 % 57.35 % Effect of merger and restructuring charges, net of tax benefit (0.72 ) (1.24 ) (3.61 ) Operating efficiency ratio 49.66 % 53.13 % 52.38 % 51.84 % 53.74 % Reconciliation of dividend payout ratio to operating dividend payout ratio Dividend payout ratio 46.61 % 46.31 % 39.76 % 38.79 % 48.40 % Effect of merger and restructuring charges, net of tax benefit (0.77 ) (1.33 ) (6.92 ) Operating dividend payout ratio 45.84 % 44.98 % 39.76 % 38.79 % 41.48 % Reconciliation of operating leverage to operating leverage (combined basis) Operating leverage 8.41 % (4.91 )% (1.12 )% n/a n/a Effect of merger and restructuring charges (0.93 ) 3.07 n/a n/a Effect of FleetBoston pro forma results 0.85 2.28 (4.94 ) n/a n/a Operating leverage (combined basis) (3) 8.33 % 0.44 % (6.06 )% n/a n/a (1) Operating basis excludes Merger and Restructuring Charges.

Merger and Restructuring Charges in 2001 represented Provision for Credit Losses of $395 million and Noninterest Expense of $1.3 billion, both of which were related to the exit of certain consumer finance businesses. (2) As a result of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, we no longer amortize Goodwill. Goodwill amortization expense was $662 million in 2001. (3) Operating leverage (combined basis) includes the results of FleetBoston for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 on a pro forma basis. In 2004, operating leverage was impacted by the costs to integrate FleetBoston; however, in 2005, operating leverage benefited from FleetBoston Merger cost savings. n/a = not available 25 Table of Contents Core Net Interest Income Managed Basis In managing our business, we review core net interest income on a managed basis, which adjusts reported Net Interest Income on a FTE basis for the impact of trading-related activities and revolving securitizations. As discussed in the Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking business segment section beginning on page 35, we evaluate our trading results and strategies based on total trading-related revenue, calculated by combining trading-related Net Interest Income with Trading Account Profits. We also adjust for loans that we originated and sold into revolving credit card, home equity line and commercial loan securitizations. Noninterest Income, rather than Net Interest Income and Provision for Credit Losses, is recorded for assets that have been securitized as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and record servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations, where appropriate. An analysis of core net interest income managed basis, core average earning assets managed basis and core net interest yield on earning assets managed basis, which adjusts for the impact of these two non-core items from reported Net Interest Income on a FTE basis, is shown below. Table 4 Core Net Interest Income Managed Basis (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) Net interest income As reported (FTE basis) $ 31,569 $ 28,677 $ 21,149 Impact of trading-related net interest income (1,444 ) (2,039 ) (2,235 ) Core net interest income 30,125 26,638 18,914 Impact of revolving securitizations 708 882 311 Core net interest income managed basis $ 30,833 $ 27,520 $ 19,225 Average earning assets As reported $ 1,111,994 $ 905,273 $ 649,598 Impact of trading-related earning assets (299,374 ) (227,230 ) (172,428 ) Core average earning assets 812,620 678,043 477,170 Impact of revolving securitizations 8,440 10,181 3,342 Core average earning assets managed basis $ 821,060 $ 688,224 $ 480,512 Net interest yield contribution As reported (FTE basis) 2.84 % 3.17 % 3.26 % Impact of trading-related activities 0.87 0.76 0.70 Core net interest yield on earning assets 3.71 3.93 3.96 Impact of revolving securitizations 0.04 0.06 0.03 Core net interest yield on earning assets managed basis 3.75 % 3.99 % 3.99 % Core net interest income on a managed basis increased $3.3 billion for 2005. This increase was driven by the impact of the FleetBoston Merger, organic growth in consumer (primarily credit card and home equity) and commercial loans, higher domestic deposit levels and a larger ALM portfolio (primarily securities). Partially offsetting these increases was the adverse impact of spread compression due to the flattening of the yield curve. Core average earning assets on a managed basis increased $132.8 billion primarily due to higher ALM levels (primarily securities) and higher levels of consumer loans (primarily home equity and credit card). The increases in these assets were due to organic growth as well as the impact of the FleetBoston Merger. The core net interest yield on a managed basis decreased 24 bps as a result of the impact of spread compression due to flattening of the yield curve and a larger ALM portfolio partially offset by higher levels of core deposits and consumer loans. Business Segment Operations Segment Description The Corporation reports the results of its operations through four business segments: Global Consumer and Small Business Banking , Global Business and Financial Services , Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking , and Global Wealth and Investment Management . During the third quarter of 2005, our operations in Mexico were realigned and are now included in the results of Global Business and Financial Services , rather than Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking . Also during the third quarter of 2005, we announced the future combination of Global Business and Financial Services and Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking that was effective on January 1, 2006. This new 26 Table of Contents segment is called Global Corporate and Investment Banking . This new segment will enable us to more effectively leverage the universal bank model in servicing our business clients. In the universal bank model, teams of consumer, commercial and investment bankers work together to provide all clients, regardless of size, the right combination of products and services to meet their needs. All Other consists primarily of Equity Investments, the residual impact of the allowance for credit losses process, Merger and Restructuring Charges, intersegment eliminations, and the results of certain consumer finance and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated. All Other also includes certain amounts associated with the ALM process, including the impact of funds transfer pricing allocation methodologies, amounts associated with the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations that do not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting treatment, gains or losses on sales of whole mortgage loans, and Gains on Sales of Debt Securities. For more information on All Other , see page 40. Basis of Presentation We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP methodologies and performance measures many of which are discussed in Supplemental Financial Data on page 24. We begin by evaluating the operating results of the businesses, which by definition excludes Merger and Restructuring Charges. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies, which are utilized to determine operating income. The Net Interest Income of the business segments includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Net Interest Income also reflects an allocation of Net Interest Income generated by assets and liabilities used in our ALM process. The results of the business segments will fluctuate based on the performance of corporate ALM activities. The restatement impact to Net Interest Income, associated with the economic hedges that did not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting, was included in All Other , and was not allocated to the business segments. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments based on pre-determined means. The most significant of these expenses include data processing costs, item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies which reflect utilization. Equity is allocated to the business segments using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each unit credit, market and operational risk components. The nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page 49. ROE is calculated by dividing Net Income by allocated equity. SVA is defined as cash basis earnings on an operating basis less a charge for the use of capital (i.e. equity). Cash basis earnings on an operating basis is defined as Net Income adjusted to exclude Merger and Restructuring Charges, and Amortization of Intangibles. The charge for capital is calculated by multiplying 11 percent (management estimate of the shareholders minimum required rate of return on capital invested) by average total common shareholders equity at the corporate level and by average allocated equity at the business segment level. Average equity is allocated to the business level using a methodology identical to that used in the ROE calculation. Management reviews the estimate of the rate used to calculate the capital charge annually. The Capital Asset Pricing Model is used to estimate our cost of capital. See Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional business segment information, selected financial information for the business segments and reconciliations to consolidated Total Revenue and Net Income amounts. 27 Table of Contents Global Consumer and Small Business Banking The strategy of Global Consumer and Small Business Banking is to attract, retain and deepen customer relationships. We achieve this strategy through our ability to offer a wide range of products and services through a franchise that stretches coast to coast through 29 states and the District of Columbia. We serve more than 38 million consumer and small business relationships utilizing our network of 5,873 banking centers, 16,785 domestic branded ATMs, and telephone and Internet channels. Within Global Consumer and Small Business Banking , our most significant product groups are Card Services, Consumer Real Estate and Consumer Deposit and Debit Products. Global Consumer and Small Business Banking (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 17,053 $ 15,911 Noninterest income: Service charges 4,996 4,329 Mortgage banking income 1,012 589 Card income (1) 5,476 4,359 All other income 339 (32 ) Total noninterest income 11,823 9,245 Total revenue (FTE basis) 28,876 25,156 Provision for credit losses 4,271 3,333 Gains (losses) on sales of debt securities (2 ) 117 Noninterest expense 13,440 12,555 Income before income taxes 11,163 9,385 Income tax expense 4,007 3,414 Net income $ 7,156 $ 5,971 Shareholder value added $ 4,013 $ 3,325 Net interest yield (FTE basis) 5.63 % 5.46 % Return on average equity 21.31 21.28 Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 46.54 49.91 Average: Total loans and leases $ 144,019 $ 122,148 Total assets 330,342 316,204 Total deposits 306,038 283,481 Common equity/Allocated equity 33,589 28,057 Year end: Total loans and leases 151,646 139,507 Total assets 335,551 336,902 Total deposits 306,083 299,062 (1) Includes Credit Card Income of $3,847 million and $3,127 million for 2005 and 2004, and Debit Card Income of $1,629 million and $1,232 million for 2005 and 2004. In 2005, Net Interest Income increased $1.1 billion, or seven percent. Growth in deposits, a low cost source of funding, positively impacted Net Interest Income. Average Deposits increased $22.6 billion, or eight percent, driven by the impact of FleetBoston customers, deepening existing relationships and our focus on attracting new customers. Partially offsetting this growth was the migration of account balances of $28.1 billion from Global Consumer and Small Business Banking to Global Wealth and Investment Management . Net Interest Income was also positively impacted by the $21.9 billion, or 18 percent, increase in Average Loans and Leases. This increase was driven by higher average balances on home equity loans and lines of credit and average held credit card outstandings. The growth in held credit card outstandings was due to the impact of FleetBoston, increases in purchase volumes, the addition of more than 5 million new accounts primarily through our branch network and direct marketing programs, and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts. Noninterest Income increased $2.6 billion, or 28 percent, in 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases of $1.1 billion, or 26 percent, in Card Income, $667 million, or 15 percent, in Service Charges and $423 million in Mortgage Banking Income. Card Income increased mainly due to higher purchase volumes for credit and debit cards, the impact of the NPC acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004, and increases in average managed credit card outstandings. The increases in card purchase volumes and average managed credit card outstandings were due to continued growth in our card business as we more effectively leveraged our branch network. The increase in Service Charges was due primarily 28 Table of Contents to the growth in new accounts. Mortgage Banking Income increased primarily due to a $400 million decrease in the impairment of MSRs. Also impacting these increases was the impact of FleetBoston. The Provision for Credit Losses increased $938 million, or 28 percent, to $4.3 billion in 2005 mainly due to credit card. For further discussion of the increased Provision for Credit Losses related to credit card, see the following section, Card Services. Noninterest Expense grew $885 million, or seven percent in 2005. The majority of the increase was due to the impact of FleetBoston and NPC. Card Services Card Services, which excludes debit cards, provides a broad offering of credit cards to an array of customers including consumers and small businesses. Our products include traditional credit cards, and a variety of co-branded and affinity card products. We also provide processing services for merchant card receipts, a business where we are a market leader, due in part to our acquisition of NPC during the fourth quarter of 2004. We evaluate our Card Services business on both a held and managed basis (a non-GAAP measure). Managed basis treats securitized loan receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet and presents the earnings on the sold loan receivables as if they were not sold. We evaluate credit card operations on a managed basis as the receivables that have been securitized are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as the held loans. The credit performance of the managed portfolio is important to understanding the results of card operations. 29 Table of Contents The following table reconciles the credit card portfolio on a held basis to a managed basis to reflect the impact of securitizations. For assets that have been securitized, we record Noninterest Income, rather than Net Interest Income and Provision for Credit Losses, as we are compensated for servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations. In a securitization, the credit card receivables, not the ongoing relationships, are sold to the trust. After the revolving period of the securitization, assuming no new securitizations, the newly generated credit card receivables arising from these relationships are recorded on our balance sheet. This has the effect of increasing Loans and Leases and increasing Net Interest Income and the Provision for Credit Losses (including net charge-offs), with a reduction in Noninterest Income. Credit Card Services (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Income Statement Data Held net interest income (1) $ 4,984 $ 4,283 Securitizations impact 572 799 Managed net interest income 5,556 5,082 Held noninterest income (1) 3,951 3,243 Securitizations impact (115 ) (185 ) Managed noninterest income 3,836 3,058 Held total revenue (1) 8,935 7,526 Securitizations impact 457 614 Managed total revenue 9,392 8,140 Held provision for credit losses (1) 3,999 3,112 Securitizations impact 434 524 Managed credit impact 4,433 3,636 Balance Sheet Data Average held credit card outstandings (1) $ 53,997 $ 43,435 Securitizations impact 5,051 6,861 Average managed credit card outstandings $ 59,048 $ 50,296 Ending held credit card outstandings (1) $ 58,548 $ 51,726 Securitizations impact 2,237 6,903 Ending managed credit card outstandings $ 60,785 $ 58,629 Credit Quality Statistics Held net charge-offs (1) $ 3,652 $ 2,305 Securitizations impact 434 524 Managed credit card net losses $ 4,086 $ 2,829 Held net charge-offs (1) 6.76 % 5.31 % Securitizations impact 0.16 0.31 Managed credit card net losses 6.92 % 5.62 % (1) Held basis is a GAAP measure. Strong credit card growth drove Card Services revenue in 2005. Held credit card revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 19 percent, to $8.9 billion. Contributing to this increase was the $701 million increase in held Net Interest Income, due to a $10.6 billion, or 24 percent, increase in average held credit card outstandings. The increase in average held credit card outstandings was due to the impact of FleetBoston, increases in purchase volumes, the addition of more than 5 million new accounts primarily through our branch network and direct marketing programs, and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts. Also driving Card Services held revenue was an increase in Noninterest Income of $708 million, or 22 percent, in 2005. The increase resulted from higher merchant discount fees, interchange fees, cash advance fees and late fees. Merchant discount fees increased $418 million primarily due to the acquisition of NPC. Interchange fees increased $87 million mainly due to a $10.4 billion, or 13 percent, increase in consumer credit card purchase volumes. Cash advance fees increased $64 million due to higher balance transfers. Late fees increased $62 million in 2005. 30 Table of Contents Held Provision for Credit Losses increased $887 million to $4.0 billion in 2005, driven primarily by higher net charge-offs. Consumer card net charge-offs were $3.7 billion, or 6.76 percent in 2005 compared to $2.3 billion, or 5.31 percent in 2004. Higher credit card net charge-offs were driven by an increase in bankruptcy related charge-offs of $578 million as card customers rushed to file ahead of the new bankruptcy law. Also impacting net charge-offs were organic portfolio growth and seasoning, increases effective in 2004 in credit card minimum payment requirements, the impact of FleetBoston and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts. We estimate that approximately 70 percent of the increased bankruptcy-related charge-offs represent acceleration from 2006. Excluding bankruptcy-related charge-offs representing acceleration from 2006 and charge-offs associated with the 2004 changes in credit card minimum payment requirements that were provided for in late 2004, the increased net charge-offs were the primary driver of the higher Provision for Credit Losses. In addition, the Provision for Credit Losses was impacted by new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts, and the establishment of reserves in 2005 for additional changes made in late 2005 in credit card minimum payment requirements. Managed card revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 15 percent, to $9.4 billion in 2005, driven by a $474 million, or nine percent, increase in managed Net Interest Income, and a $778 million, or 25 percent increase, in managed Noninterest Income. Average managed credit card outstandings were $59.0 billion in 2005 compared to $50.3 billion in 2004. The impact of FleetBoston and organic growth drove the increases in 2005. Managed consumer credit card net losses were $4.1 billion, or 6.92 percent of total average managed credit card loans in 2005, compared to $2.8 billion, or 5.62 percent in 2004. Higher managed credit card net losses were driven by an increase in bankruptcy net losses resulting from the change in the bankruptcy law, continued growth and seasoning, increases effective in 2004 in credit card minimum payment requirements and the impact of FleetBoston. For more information, see Credit Risk Management beginning on page 49. Consumer Real Estate Consumer Real Estate generates revenue by providing an extensive line of mortgage products and services to customers nationwide. Consumer Real Estate products are available to our customers through a retail network of personal bankers located in 5,873 banking centers, dedicated sales account executives in over 150 locations and through a dedicated sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. Additionally, we serve our customers through a partnership with more than 6,600 mortgage brokers in 49 states. The mortgage product offerings for home purchase and refinancing needs include fixed and adjustable rate loans, and home equity lines of credit. To manage this portfolio, these products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors while retaining Bank of America customer relationships or are held on our balance sheet for ALM purposes. Consumer Real Estate is managed with a focus on its two primary businesses, first mortgage and home equity. The first mortgage business includes the origination, fulfillment and servicing of first mortgage loan products. Servicing activities primarily include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. Servicing income includes ancillary income derived in connection with these activities, such as late fees. The home equity business includes lines of credit and second mortgages. These two businesses provide us with a business model that meets customer real estate borrowing needs in various interest rate cycles. Total revenue for the Consumer Real Estate business increased $558 million to $3.2 billion in 2005. The following table shows the Global Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue components of the Consumer Real Estate business. Consumer Real Estate Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Net Interest Income Home equity $ 1,340 $ 1,108 Residential first mortgage 806 1,140 Net interest income 2,146 2,248 Mortgage banking income (1) 1,012 589 Trading account profits (349 ) Other income 66 178 Total consumer real estate revenue $ 3,224 $ 2,666 (1) For more information, see the following Mortgage Banking Income table. 31 Table of Contents Net Interest Income decreased $102 million primarily driven by the impact of spread compression due to flattening of the yield curve and the $2.3 billion decrease in average residential first mortgage balances. This decrease was partially offset by higher average balances in the home equity portfolio, which grew $11.2 billion, or 31 percent, to $47.7 billion which was attributable to account growth and larger line sizes resulting from enhanced product offerings, the expanding home equity market and the impact of FleetBoston. In 2005, home equity average balances across all business lines grew $18.8 billion, or 42 percent, to $63.9 billion and home equity production improved $15.3 billion, or 27 percent, to $72.0 billion compared to 2004. In 2005, there were no Trading Account Profits compared to a loss of $349 million in 2004, related to the Certificates. Effective June 1, 2004, the Certificates were converted to MSRs. Prior to the conversion, changes in the value of the Certificates, MSRs and derivatives used for risk management were recognized as Trading Account Profits. In 2004, Trading Account Profits included $342 million of downward adjustments for changes to valuation assumptions and prepayment adjustments. Mortgage Banking Income increased $423 million to $1.0 billion in 2005. The following summarizes the components of Mortgage Banking Income which include production income from loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income that reflects the performance of the servicing portfolio. Mortgage Banking Income (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Production income (1) $ 674 $ 765 Servicing income: Servicing fees and ancillary income 848 615 Amortization of MSRs (613 ) (345 ) Gains on sales of MSRs 14 Net MSR and SFAS 133 derivative hedge adjustments (2) 167 18 Losses on derivatives (3) (15 ) (1 ) Impairment of MSRs (63 ) (463 ) Total net servicing income 338 (176 ) Total mortgage banking income (4) $ 1,012 $ 589 (1) Includes $(14) million and $2 million related to hedge ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges on our mortgage warehouse for 2005 and 2004. (2) Represents derivative hedge losses of $124 million under SFAS 133, offset by an increase in the value of the MSRs of $291 million for 2005, and derivative hedge gains of $228 million offset by a decrease in the value of the MSRs of $210 million for 2004. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Net losses on derivatives used as economic hedges of MSRs not designated as SFAS 133 hedges. (4) Includes revenue for mortgage services provided to other segments that are eliminated in consolidation (in All Other ) of $207 million and $175 million for 2005 and 2004. Production for residential first mortgages, within Global Consumer and Small Business Banking , was $74.7 billion in 2005 compared to $80.2 billion in 2004, a decrease of seven percent. In 2005, production income decreased $91 million to $674 million due to lower production volume and margin compression. The volume reduction resulted in lower loan sales to the secondary market in 2005 of $65.1 billion, an eight percent decrease from 2004. Across all segments, residential first mortgage production was $86.8 billion in 2005 compared to $87.5 billion in 2004. Of the volume across all segments during 2005, $60.3 billion was originated through retail channels, and $26.5 billion was originated through the wholesale channel. This compares to $57.6 billion and $30.0 billion during 2004. Refinance activity in 2005 was approximately 49 percent of the production compared to 57 percent in 2004. The Consumer Real Estate servicing portfolio includes originated and retained residential mortgages, loans serviced for others and home equity loans. The servicing portfolio at December 31, 2005 was $368.4 billion, $35.9 billion higher than December 31, 2004, driven primarily by production, home equity account growth and lower prepayment rates. Net servicing income rose $514 million in 2005, primarily driven by a $400 million decrease in impairment of MSRs. Impairment charges in 2004 included a $261 million adjustment for changes in valuation assumptions and prepayment adjustments to align with changing market conditions and customer behavioral trends. 32 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005, the MSR balance was $2.7 billion, an increase of $300 million, or 13 percent, from December 31, 2004. This value represented 122 bps of the related unpaid principal balance, a three percent increase from December 31, 2004. The following table outlines our MSR statistical information: Consumer Real Estate Mortgage Servicing Rights (1) December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 MSR data: Balance $ 2,658 $ 2,358 Capitalization value 1.22 % 1.19 % Unpaid balance (2) $ 218,172 $ 197,795 Number of customers (in thousands) 1,619 1,582 (1) Excludes MSRs in Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking at December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $148 million and $123 million. (2) Represents the portion of our servicing portfolio for which a MSR asset has been recorded. MSRs are accounted for at the lower of cost or market with impairment recognized as a reduction to Mortgage Banking Income. A combination of derivatives and AFS securities (e.g. mortgage-backed securities) is utilized to hedge the changes in value associated with the MSRs. At December 31, 2005, $2.3 billion of MSRs were hedged using a SFAS 133 strategy and $250 million of MSRs were economically hedged using AFS securities. During 2005, Net Interest Income included $18 million on these AFS securities. At December 31, 2005, the unrealized loss on AFS securities used to economically hedge the MSRs was $29 million compared to an unrealized gain of $21 million at December 31, 2004. For more information on MSRs, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consumer Deposit and Debit Products Consumer Deposit and Debit Products provides a comprehensive range of products to consumers and small businesses. Our products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, regular and interest-checking accounts, debit cards and a variety of business checking options. In 2005, we added approximately 2.3 million net new retail checking accounts and 1.9 million net new retail savings accounts. This growth resulted from continued improvement in sales and service results in the Banking Center Channel, the introduction of new products, the addition of 99 new stores and the impact of FleetBoston. In the FleetBoston franchise, we opened 431,000 net new retail checking and 348,000 net new retail savings accounts since the FleetBoston Merger on April 1, 2004. Consumer deposit products provide a relatively stable and inexpensive source of liquidity. We earn net interest spread revenues from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client facing lending activity and our ALM process. The revenue streams from these activities are allocated to our deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits. Deposits also generate account fees while debit cards generate interchange income. The following table shows the components of Total Revenue for Consumer Deposit and Debit Products. Consumer Deposit and Debit Products Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Net interest income $ 8,380 $ 6,982 Deposit service charges 4,986 4,321 Debit card income 1,629 1,232 Total noninterest income 6,615 5,553 Total deposit and debit revenue $ 14,995 $ 12,535 Total deposit and debit revenue grew $2.5 billion, or 20 percent, in 2005. Driving this growth was an increase of $1.4 billion, or 20 percent, in Net Interest Income resulting from higher levels of deposits. Also impacting the growth in Net Interest Income was our pricing strategy and the positive impact of the FleetBoston Merger. Deposit service charges increased $665 million, or 15 percent, in 2005. The increase was primarily due to the growth of new accounts across our franchise and the impact of the FleetBoston Merger. 33 Table of Contents Debit card income, which is included in Card Income on the Consolidated Statement of Income, increased $397 million, or 32 percent, in 2005. Driving the increase was growth in transaction activity as purchase volumes increased 29 percent due to new accounts, growth in average ticket size and the positive impact of the FleetBoston Merger, as well as higher interchange rates on debit card transactions.

The increase was largely due to growth in commercial loans and leases, deposit balances, and the impact of FleetBoston earning assets offset by spread compression driven by a flattening yield curve. Average outstanding Loans and Leases increased $28.8 billion, or 19 percent, in 2005 due to loan growth in Middle Market Banking, Dealer Financial Services (primarily due to consumer bulk purchases) , Commercial Real Estate Banking, Leasing and Business Banking. Average commercial deposits, which are a lower cost source of funding, increased $13.7 billion, or 15 percent, in 2005, driven by deposit growth in Middle Market Banking, Business Banking, Latin America and Commercial Real Estate Banking . Noninterest Income increased $655 million, or 24 percent, in 2005. The increase was driven by a $420 million increase in other noninterest income to $1.7 billion, primarily due to the FleetBoston Merger and gains on early lease terminations. Higher Service Charges impacted the increase in Noninterest Income, primarily driven by the FleetBoston Merger. The Provision for Credit Losses increased $393 million to negative $49 million in 2005 compared to negative $442 million in 2004. The negative provision reflects continued improvement in commercial credit quality although at a slower rate than experienced in 2004. An improved risk profile in Latin America and reduced uncertainties resulting from the completion of credit-related integration activities for FleetBoston also contributed to the negative provision. For more information, see Credit Risk Management beginning on page 49. Noninterest Expense increased $564 million, or 16 percent. The increase was primarily due to higher Personnel expense as a result of increased performance based incentive compensation, higher processing costs and the FleetBoston Merger. Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking Our strategy is to align our resources with sectors where we can deliver value-added financial solutions to our issuer and investor clients. This segment provides a broad range of financial services to large corporate domestic and international clients, financial institutions, and government entities.

Our products and services include loan originations, mergers and acquisitions advisory, debt and equity underwriting, distribution and trading, cash management, derivatives, foreign exchange, leveraged finance, structured finance and trade services. During the third quarter of 2005, our operations in Mexico were realigned and are now included in the results of Global Business and Financial Services , rather than Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking . Also during the third quarter of 2005, we announced the future combination of Global Business and Financial Services and Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking that was effective on January 1, 2006. This new segment is called Global Corporate and Investment Banking . During the fourth quarter of 2004, we announced a strategic initiative to invest approximately $675 million in Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking to expand on opportunities in the business platform. These investments were primarily focused on expanding our fixed income activities with both the issuer and investor client sectors. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 80 percent of this investment had been invested on personnel, technology and other infrastructure costs, which are all in various phases of execution. We remain committed to the build out of this business and believe that in time we will be well-positioned in the markets where we choose to compete. This segment offers clients a comprehensive range of global capabilities through the following three financial services: Global Investment Banking, Global Credit Products and Global Treasury Services . Global Investment Banking is comprised of Corporate and Investment Banking , and Global Capital Markets . Global Investment Banking underwrites and makes markets in equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, commercial paper, and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities.

Driving the decrease was lower trading-related Net Interest Income of $595 million, or 29 percent. Despite the growth in average trading-related earning assets of $70.9 billion, or 33 percent, the contribution to Net Interest Income decreased due to a flattening yield curve. In 2005, core net interest income decreased $165 million to $1.9 billion primarily due to spread compression. Average Deposits increased $10.2 billion, or 14 percent, due to higher foreign deposits and escrow balances. Noninterest Income increased $723 million, or 14 percent, in 2005. Driving the increase were higher Trading Account Profits of $641 million, Equity Investment Gains (included in all other income) of $123 million and Investment and Brokerage Services of $101 million. The increase in Trading Account Profits was due to growth in average trading-related earning assets as a result of increased client activity as we continued to invest in the business. These increases were partially offset by declines in Service Charges of $141 million due to effects of rising earnings credits on balances required for services and lower Investment Banking Income of $34 million. Provision for Credit Losses increased $201 million to negative $244 million in 2005, compared to negative $445 million in 2004, driven by a slower rate of improvement in commercial credit quality. Net charge-offs declined $245 million from the prior year, driven partially by increased recoveries. For more information, see Credit Risk Management beginning on page 49. Noninterest Expense remained relatively unchanged in 2005. Other general operating expense decreased primarily due to the segment share of the mutual fund settlement and other litigation reserves recorded in 2004. This decrease was offset by higher Personnel expense, including costs associated with the strategic initiative. 37 Table of Contents Trading-related revenue and equity commissions, both key measures reviewed by management, are presented in the following table. Trading-related Revenue and Equity Commissions (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Trading-related net interest income (1) $ 1,444 $ 2,039 Trading account profits (2) 1,664 1,023 Total trading-related revenue (2) 3,108 3,062 Equity commissions (1,3) 794 667 Total trading-related revenue and equity commissions $ 3,902 $ 3,729 Trading-related Revenue by Product and Equity Commissions Fixed income $ 1,054 $ 1,547 Interest rate (1) 767 667 Foreign exchange 744 752 Equities and equity commissions (1) 1,201 862 Commodities 87 45 Market-based trading-related revenue and equity commissions 3,853 3,873 Credit portfolio hedges (4) 49 (144 ) Total trading-related revenue and equity commissions (2) $ 3,902 $ 3,729 (1) FTE basis (2) Total corporate Trading Account Profits were $1,812 million and $869 million in 2005 and 2004. Total corporate trading-related revenue was $3,256 million and $2,908 million in 2005 and 2004. (3) Equity commissions are included in Investment and Brokerage Services in the Consolidated Statement of Income. (4) Includes CDS and related products used for credit risk management. For additional information on CDS, see Concentrations of Commercial Credit Risk beginning on page 53. In 2005, market-based trading-related revenue was $3.9 billion, relatively unchanged from the prior year. Fixed income revenue decreased $493 million due to increased spread volatility in certain industries and lack of investor demand. Offsetting this decline were increases in equities and equity commissions, interest rate-related revenues and commodities. Trading-related revenue from equities and equity commissions increased $339 million due to higher customer activity and the absence of net losses on a stock position that occurred in 2004. Interest rate-related revenues increased $100 million primarily related to higher sales activity. In 2005, commodities revenue increased $42 million as the prior year included losses related to positions in gas and jet fuel. Total trading-related revenue and equity commissions included net gains of $49 million associated with credit portfolio hedges, an improvement of $193 million from 2004. The improvement was primarily due to widening of spreads on CDS in certain industries. The following table presents the detail of Investment Banking Income within the segment. Investment Banking Income (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Securities underwriting $ 787 $ 920 Syndications 528 521 Advisory services 409 310 Other 25 32 Total investment banking income (1) $ 1,749 $ 1,783 (1) Investment Banking Income recorded in other business units in 2005 and 2004 was $107 million and $103 million. Investment Banking Income decreased $34 million, or two percent, in 2005. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in securities underwriting as the overall market contracted and private placement activity declined. This decline was partially offset by market share gains in certain debt issuance markets and higher advisory services income due to increased merger and advisory activity.

Global Wealth and Investment Management (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 3,770 $ 2,869 Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 3,122 2,728 All other income 501 336 Total noninterest income 3,623 3,064 Total revenue (FTE basis) 7,393 5,933 Provision for credit losses (5 ) (20 ) Noninterest expense 3,672 3,431 Income before income taxes 3,726 2,522 Income tax expense 1,338 917 Net income $ 2,388 $ 1,605 Shareholder value added $ 1,337 $ 754 Net interest yield (FTE basis) 3.21 % 3.36 % Return on average equity 23.34 19.35 Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 49.66 57.83 Average: Total loans and leases $ 54,021 $ 44,057 Total assets 125,289 91,889 Total deposits 115,301 83,053 Common equity/Allocated equity 10,232 8,296 Year end: Total loans and leases 58,277 49,783 Total assets 127,156 122,587 Total deposits 113,389 111,107 Net Interest Income increased $901 million, or 31 percent, in 2005. This increase was due to growth in deposits and loans in PB&I and The Private Bank . Average Deposits increased $32.2 billion, or 39 percent, in 2005 primarily due to the migration of $28.1 billion of account balances from Global Consumer and Small Business Banking to PB&I , and organic growth in PB&I and The Private Bank . Average Loans and Leases increased $10.0 billion, or 23 percent, due to higher loan volume in PB&I and The Private Bank. The secondary driver of the increase in Average Deposits, and Loans and Leases was the impact of the FleetBoston portfolio. 39 Table of Contents Noninterest Income increased $559 million, or 18 percent, in 2005. Noninterest Income consists primarily of Investment and Brokerage Services, which represents fees earned on client assets and brokerage commissions. The Investment and Brokerage Services revenue increase in 2005, compared to 2004, was mainly due to the impact of FleetBoston. Client Assets December 31 (Dollars in billions) 2005 2004 Assets under management $ 482.4 $ 451.5 Client brokerage assets 161.7 149.9 Assets in custody 94.2 107.0 Total client assets $ 738.3 $ 708.4 Total client assets increased $29.9 billion, or four percent, in 2005. This increase was due to the $30.9 billion increase in assets under management in 2005, which was driven by net inflows primarily in short-term money market assets and an increase in overall market valuations. Assets under management generate fees based on a percentage of their market value. They consist largely of mutual funds and separate accounts, which are comprised of taxable and nontaxable money market products, equities, and taxable and nontaxable fixed income securities. Noninterest Expense increased $241 million, or seven percent, in 2005. The increase was due primarily to increased Personnel expenses driven by PB&I growth in the Northeast and the impact of FleetBoston. This increase was partially offset by lower other general operating expenses due to the segment share of the mutual fund settlement recorded in 2004. All Other Included in All Other are our Equity Investments businesses, and Other . Equity Investments include Principal Investing and corporate investments. Principal Investing is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in privately-held and publicly-traded companies at all stages of their life cycle from start-up to buyout. Corporate investments include CCB, Grupo Financiero Santander Serfin and various other investments. Other includes the residual impact of the allowance for credit losses process, Merger and Restructuring Charges, intersegment eliminations, and the results of certain consumer finance and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated. Other also includes certain amounts associated with the ALM process, including the impact of funds transfer pricing allocation methodologies, amounts associated with the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations that do not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting treatment, gains or losses on sales of whole mortgage loans, and Gains on Sales of Debt Securities. The objective of the funds transfer pricing allocation methodology is to neutralize the business segments from changes in interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations. Accordingly, for segment reporting purposes, the business segments receive the neutralizing benefit to Net Interest Income related to the economic hedges previously mentioned, with the offset recorded in Other . 40 Table of Contents All Other (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 (Restated) Net interest income (FTE basis) (1) $ (340 ) $ (695 ) Noninterest income: Equity investment gains 1,646 750 All other income (1) (821 ) 241 Total noninterest income 825 991 Total revenue (FTE basis) 485 296 Provision for credit losses 41 343 Gains on sales of debt securities (1) 823 1,617 Merger and restructuring charges 412 618 All other noninterest expense 317 229 Income before income taxes 538 723 Income tax expense (benefit) (85 ) 120 Net income $ 623 $ 603 Shareholder value added $ (884 ) $ (531 ) (1) Included in these amounts are impacts related to derivatives designated as economic hedges which do not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting treatment of $(419) million and $(834) million in Net Interest Income and $(256) million and $920 million in Noninterest Income. The impact, including $0 and a loss of $(399) million in Gains on Sales of Debt Securities, totaled $(675) million and $(313) million in 2005 and 2004. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Total Revenue for All Other increased $189 million to $485 million in 2005, primarily driven by an increase in Equity Investment Gains in 2005. Offsetting this increase was the decline in fair value of derivative instruments which were used as economic hedges of interest and foreign exchange rates as part of the ALM process. Changes in value of these derivative instruments were due to interest rate fluctuations during the year. Provision for Credit Losses decreased $302 million to $41 million in 2005, resulting from changes to components of the formula and other factors effective in 2004, and reduced credit costs in 2005 associated with previously exited businesses. These decreases were offset in part by the establishment of a $50 million reserve for estimated losses associated with Hurricane Katrina. Gains on Sales of Debt Securities decreased $794 million primarily due to lower gains realized in 2005 on mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds than in 2004. Securities gains are the result of the repositioning of the securities portfolio to manage interest rate fluctuations and mortgage prepayment risk. The Corporation utilized a forward purchase agreement to hedge the variability of cash flows from the anticipated purchase of securities. The Corporation subsequently sold the related securities and did not originally reclassify the loss from Accumulated OCI at the time the related securities were sold. Merger and Restructuring Charges decreased $206 million in 2005 as the FleetBoston integration is nearing completion and the infrastructure initiative was completed in the first quarter of 2005. For more information on Merger and Restructuring Charges, see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Income Tax Expense (Benefit) was a benefit of $85 million in 2005, compared to an expense of $120 million in 2004. The change in Income Tax Expense (Benefit) was driven by an increase in tax benefits for low-income housing credits. These tax benefits are allocated to Global Consumer and Small Business Banking as FTE Noninterest Income through our segment reporting process. All Other includes an offset to this FTE impact. Equity Investments Equity Investments reported Net Income of $796 million in 2005, a $594 million improvement compared to 2004. The improvements were primarily due to higher revenues in Principal Investing driven by increasing liquidity in the private equity markets. When compared to the prior year, Principal Investing revenue increased $966 million to $1.4 billion. The increased revenues were driven by higher realized gains and reduced impairments compared to the prior year. 41 Table of Contents The following table presents the carrying value of equity investments in the Principal Investing portfolio by major industry at December 31, 2005 and 2004: Equity Investments in the Principal Investing Portfolio December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Consumer discretionary $ 1,607 $ 2,058 Information technology 1,131 1,089 Industrials 1,017 1,118 Telecommunication services 708 769 Financials 632 606 Healthcare 560 576 Materials 288 421 Consumer staples 213 230 Real estate 188 229 Energy 56 81 Individual trusts, nonprofits, government 43 49 Utilities 19 24 Total $ 6,462 $ 7,250 On- and Off-balance Sheet Financing Entities Off-balance Sheet Commercial Paper Conduits In addition to traditional lending, we also support our customers financing needs by facilitating their access to the commercial paper markets. These markets provide an attractive, lower-cost financing alternative for our customers. Our customers sell assets, such as high-grade trade or other receivables or leases, to a commercial paper financing entity, which in turn issues high-grade short-term commercial paper that is collateralized by the underlying assets. Additionally, some customers receive the benefit of commercial paper financing rates related to certain lease arrangements. We facilitate these transactions and collect fees from the financing entity for the services it provides including administration, trust services and marketing the commercial paper. We receive fees for providing combinations of liquidity, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) or similar loss protection commitments, and derivatives to the commercial paper financing entities. These forms of asset support are senior to the first layer of asset support provided by customers through over-collateralization or by support provided by third parties. The rating agencies require that a certain percentage of the commercial paper entity assets be supported by the seller over-collateralization and our SBLC in order to receive their respective investment rating. The SBLC would be drawn on only when the over-collateralization provided by the seller is not sufficient to cover losses of the related asset. Liquidity commitments made to the commercial paper entity are designed to fund scheduled redemptions of commercial paper if there is a market disruption or the new commercial paper cannot be issued to fund the redemption of the maturing commercial paper. The liquidity facility has the same legal priority as the commercial paper. We do not enter into any other form of guarantee with these entities. We manage our credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to our normal underwriting and risk management processes. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had off-balance sheet liquidity commitments and SBLCs to these entities of $25.9 billion and $23.8 billion. Substantially all of these liquidity commitments and SBLCs mature within one year. These amounts are included in Table 6. Net revenues earned from fees associated with these off-balance sheet financing entities were approximately $71 million and $80 million in 2005 and 2004. From time to time, we may purchase some of the commercial paper issued by certain of these entities for our own account or acting as a dealer on behalf of third parties. Derivative instruments related to these entities are marked to market through the Consolidated Statement of Income. SBLCs are initially recorded at fair value in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees (FIN 45). Liquidity commitments and SBLCs subsequent to inception are accounted for pursuant to SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5), and are discussed further in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The commercial paper conduits are variable interest entities (VIEs) as defined in FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R), which provides a framework for identifying VIEs and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements. In accordance with FIN 46R, the primary beneficiary is the party that consolidates a VIE based on its assessment that it will absorb a 42 Table of Contents majority of the expected losses or expected residual returns of the entity, or both. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the commercial paper conduits described above and, therefore, have not included the assets and liabilities or results of operations of these conduits in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation. On-balance Sheet Commercial Paper Conduits In addition to the off-balance sheet financing entities previously described, we also utilize commercial paper conduits that have been consolidated based on our determination that we are the primary beneficiary of the entities in accordance with FIN 46R. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the consolidated assets and liabilities of these conduits were reflected in AFS Securities, Other Assets, and Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings in Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking . At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we held $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion of assets of these entities while our maximum loss exposure associated with these entities, including unfunded lending commitments, was approximately $8.0 billion and $9.4 billion. We manage our credit risk on the on-balance sheet commitments by subjecting them to the same processes as the off-balance sheet commitments. Qualified Special Purpose Entities In addition, to control our capital position, diversify funding sources and provide customers with commercial paper investments, we will, from time to time, sell assets to off-balance sheet commercial paper entities. The commercial paper entities are Qualified Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) that have been isolated beyond our reach or that of our creditors, even in the event of bankruptcy or other receivership. The accounting for these entities is governed by SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125, (SFAS 140) which provides that QSPEs are not included in the consolidated financial statements of the seller. Assets sold to the entities consist of high-grade corporate or municipal bonds, collateralized debt obligations and asset-backed securities. These entities issue collateralized commercial paper or notes with similar repricing characteristics to third party market participants and passive derivative instruments to us. Assets sold to the entities typically have an investment rating ranging from Aaa/AAA to Aa/AA. We may provide liquidity, SBLCs or similar loss protection commitments to the entity, or we may enter into derivatives with the entity in which we assume certain risks. The liquidity facility and derivatives have the same legal standing with the commercial paper. The derivatives provide interest rate, currency and a pre-specified amount of credit protection to the entity in exchange for the commercial paper rate. These derivatives are provided for in the legal documents and help to alleviate any cash flow mismatches. In some cases, if an asset rating declines below a certain investment quality as evidenced by its investment rating or defaults, we are no longer exposed to the risk of loss. At that time, the commercial paper holders assume the risk of loss. In other cases, we agree to assume all of the credit exposure related to the referenced asset. Legal documents for each entity specify asset quality levels that require the entity to automatically dispose of the asset once the asset falls below the specified quality rating. At the time the asset is disposed, we are required to reimburse the entity for any credit-related losses depending on the pre-specified level of protection provided. We manage any credit or market risk on commitments or derivatives through normal underwriting and risk management processes. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had off-balance sheet liquidity commitments, SBLCs and other financial guarantees to these entities of $7.1 billion and $7.4 billion. Substantially all of these commitments mature within one year and are included in Table 6. Derivative activity related to these entities is included in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net revenues earned from fees associated with these entities were $86 million and $61 million in 2005 and 2004. We generally do not purchase any of the commercial paper issued by these types of financing entities other than during the underwriting process when we act as issuing agent nor do we purchase any of the commercial paper for our own account. Derivative instruments related to these entities are marked to market through the Consolidated Statement of Income. SBLCs are initially recorded at fair value in accordance with FIN 45. Liquidity commitments and SBLCs subsequent to inception are accounted for pursuant to SFAS 5 and are discussed further in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit and Liquidity Risks Because we provide liquidity and credit support to the commercial paper conduits and QSPEs described above, our credit ratings and changes thereto will affect the borrowing cost and liquidity of these entities. In addition, significant changes in counterparty asset valuation and credit standing may also affect the liquidity of the commercial paper issuance. Disruption in the commercial paper markets may result in our having to fund under these commitments and SBLCs discussed above. We seek to manage these risks, along with all other credit and liquidity risks, within our policies and practices. See Notes 1 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of off-balance sheet financing entities. 43 Table of Contents Other Off-balance Sheet Financing Entities To improve our capital position and diversify funding sources, we also sell assets, primarily loans, to other off-balance sheet QSPEs that obtain financing primarily by issuing term notes. We may retain a portion of the investment grade notes issued by these entities, and we may also retain subordinated interests in the entities which reduce the credit risk of the senior investors. We may provide liquidity support in the form of foreign exchange or interest rate swaps. We generally do not provide other forms of credit support to these entities, which are described more fully in Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the above, we had significant involvement with variable interest entities (VIEs) other than the commercial paper conduits. These VIEs were not consolidated because we will not absorb a majority of the expected losses or expected residual returns and are therefore not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. These entities are described more fully in Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Obligations and Commitments We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. Obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time are defined as purchase obligations. Included in purchase obligations are vendor contracts of $4.0 billion, commitments to purchase securities of $34.2 billion and commitments to purchase loans of $51.7 billion. The most significant of our vendor contracts include communication services, processing services and software contracts. Other long-term liabilities include our obligations related to the Qualified Pension Plans, Nonqualified Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans (the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans assets and any participant contributions, if applicable. During 2005 and 2004, we contributed $1.1 billion and $303 million to the Plans, and we expect to make at least $134 million of contributions during 2006. Management believes the effect of the Plans on liquidity is not significant to our overall financial condition. Debt, lease and other obligations are more fully discussed in Notes 12 and 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Table 5 presents total long-term debt and other obligations at December 31, 2005.

(2) Obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time are defined as purchase obligations. Many of our lending relationships contain funded and unfunded elements. The funded portion is reflected on our balance sheet. The unfunded component of these commitments is not recorded on our balance sheet until a draw is made under the loan facility; however, a reserve is established for probable losses. These commitments, as well as guarantees, are more fully discussed in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date. At December 31, 2005, charge cards (nonrevolving card lines) to individuals and government entities guaranteed by the U.S. government in the amount of $9.4 billion (related outstandings of $171 million) were not included in credit card line commitments in the table below.

Managing Risk Overview Our management governance structure enables us to manage all major aspects of our business through an integrated planning and review process that includes strategic, financial, associate, customer and risk planning. We derive much of our revenue from managing risk from customer transactions for profit. In addition to qualitative factors, we utilize quantitative measures to optimize risk and reward trade offs in order to achieve growth targets and financial objectives while reducing the variability of earnings and minimizing unexpected losses. Risk metrics that allow us to measure performance include economic capital targets, SVA targets and corporate risk limits. By allocating capital to a business unit, we effectively define that unit ability to take on risk. Country, trading, asset allocation and other limits supplement the allocation of economic capital. These limits are based on an analysis of risk and reward in each business unit and management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. Our risk management process continually evaluates risk and appropriate metrics needed to measure it. Our business exposes us to the following major risks: strategic, liquidity, credit, market and operational. Strategic Risk is the risk that adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, execution and/or other intrinsic risks of business will impact our ability to meet our objectives. Liquidity risk is the inability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty inability to meet its obligations. Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions, such as interest rate movements. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or external events. Risk Management Processes and Methods We have established control processes and use various methods to align risk-taking and risk management throughout our organization. These control processes and methods are designed around three lines of defense : lines of business; support units (including Risk Management, Compliance, Finance, Human Resources and Legal); and Corporate Audit. Management is responsible for identifying, quantifying, mitigating and managing all risks within their lines of business, while certain enterprise-wide risks are managed centrally. For example, except for trading-related business activities, interest rate risk associated with our business activities is managed in the Corporate Treasury and Corporate Investment functions. Line of business management makes and executes the business plan and is closest to the changing nature of risks and, therefore, we believe is best able to take actions to manage and mitigate those risks. Our lines of business prepare quarterly self-assessment reports to identify the status of risk issues, including mitigation plans, if 45 Table of Contents appropriate. These reports roll up to executive management to ensure appropriate risk management and oversight, and to identify enterprise-wide issues. Our management processes, structures and policies aid us in complying with laws and regulations and provide clear lines for decision-making and accountability. Wherever practical, we attempt to house decision-making authority as close to the transaction as possible while retaining supervisory control functions from both in and outside of the lines of business. The Risk Management organization translates approved business plans into approved limits, approves requests for changes to those limits, approves transactions as appropriate, and works closely with lines of business to establish and monitor risk parameters. Risk Management has assigned a Risk Executive to each of the lines of business who is responsible for the oversight of all risks associated with that line of business. In addition, Risk Management has assigned Risk Executives to monitor enterprise-wide credit, market and operational risks. Corporate Audit provides an independent assessment of our management and internal control systems. Corporate Audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected; significant financial, managerial and operating information is materially complete, accurate and reliable; and employees actions are in compliance with corporate policies, standards, procedures, and applicable laws and regulations. We use various methods to manage risks at the line of business levels and corporate-wide. Examples of these methods include planning and forecasting, risk committees and forums, limits, models, and hedging strategies. Planning and forecasting facilitates analysis of actual versus planned results and provides an indication of unanticipated risk levels. Generally, risk committees and forums are comprised of lines of business, risk management, treasury, compliance, legal and finance personnel, among others, who actively monitor performance against plan, limits, potential issues, and introduction of new products. Limits, the amount of exposure that may be taken in a product, relationship, region or industry, seek to align risk goals with those of each line of business and are part of our overall risk management process to help reduce the volatility of market, credit and operational losses. Models are used to estimate market value and net interest income sensitivity, and to estimate expected and unexpected losses for each product and line of business, where appropriate. Hedging strategies are used to manage the risk of borrower or counterparty concentration risk and to manage market risk in the portfolio. The formal processes used to manage risk represent only one portion of our overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the actions of our associates are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code of Ethics, we set a high standard for our associates. The Code of Ethics provides a framework for all of our associates to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of our products or services to our customers. We instill a risk-conscious culture through communications, training, policies, procedures, and organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the linkage between the associate performance management process and individual compensation to encourage associates to work toward corporate-wide risk goals. Oversight The Board evaluates risk through the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and three committees. The Finance Committee, a committee appointed by the Board, establishes policies and strategies for managing the strategic, liquidity, credit, market and operational risks to corporate earnings and capital. The Asset Quality Committee, a Board committee, reviews credit and selected market risks; and the Audit Committee, a Board committee, provides direct oversight of the corporate audit function and the independent registered public accounting firm. Additionally, senior management oversight of our risk-taking and risk management activities is conducted through four senior management committees: the Risk and Capital Committee (RCC), the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO), the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee (CORC) and the Credit Risk Committee (CRC). The RCC, a senior management committee, reviews corporate strategies and corporate objectives, evaluates business performance, and reviews business plans, including capital allocation, for the Corporation and for major businesses. The ALCO, a subcommittee of the Finance Committee, provides oversight for Corporate Treasury and Corporate Investment process of managing interest rate risk, otherwise known as the ALM process, and reviews ALM and credit hedging activities. ALCO also approves limits for trading activities and manages the risk of loss of value and related Net Interest Income of our trading activities. The CORC, a subcommittee of the Finance Committee, provides oversight and consistent communication of operational and compliance issues. The CRC, a subcommittee of the Finance Committee, establishes corporate credit practices and limits, including industry and country concentration limits and approval requirements. The CRC also reviews asset quality results versus plan, portfolio management, and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Each committee and subcommittee has the ability to delegate authority to officers of subcommittees to manage specific risks. Management continues to direct corporate-wide efforts to address the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision new risk-based capital standards (Basel II). The Finance Committee and the Audit Committee provide oversight of management plans including the Corporation preparedness and compliance with Basel II. For additional information, see Basel II on page 49 and Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections, Strategic Risk Management, Liquidity Risk and Capital Management, Credit Risk Management beginning on page 49, Market Risk Management beginning on page 65 and Operational Risk Management 46 Table of Contents beginning on page 73, address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that we manage. Strategic Risk Management The Board provides oversight for strategic risk through the CEO and the Finance Committee. We use an integrated business planning process to help manage strategic risk. A key component of the planning process aligns strategies, goals, tactics and resources. The process begins with an assessment that creates a plan for the Corporation, setting the corporate strategic direction. The planning process then cascades through the business units, creating business unit plans that are aligned with the Corporation direction. Tactics and metrics are monitored to ensure adherence to the plans. As part of this monitoring, business units perform a quarterly self-assessment further described in the Operational Risk Management section beginning on page 73. This assessment looks at changing market and business conditions, and the overall risk in meeting objectives. Corporate Audit in turn monitors, and independently reviews and evaluates, the plans and self-assessments. One of the key tools for managing strategic risk is capital allocation. Through allocating capital, we effectively manage each business segment ability to take on risk. Review and approval of business plans incorporates approval of capital allocation, and economic capital usage is monitored through financial and risk reporting. Liquidity Risk and Capital Management Liquidity Risk Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events. Sources of liquidity include deposits and other customer-based funding, wholesale market-based funding, and liquidity provided by the sale or securitization of assets. We manage liquidity at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the parent company, which is the holding company that owns the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. The second is the liquidity of the banking subsidiaries. The management of liquidity at both levels is essential because the parent company and banking subsidiaries each have different funding needs and sources, and each are subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements. Through ALCO, the Finance Committee is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy as well as approving operating and contingency procedures, and monitoring liquidity on an ongoing basis. Corporate Treasury is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategy. In order to ensure adequate liquidity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions, we conduct our liquidity management and business activities in a manner that will preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility, and diversity. Key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on customer-based funding, maintaining direct relationships with wholesale market funding providers, and maintaining the ability to liquefy certain assets when, and if, requirements warrant. We develop and maintain contingency funding plans for both the parent company and bank liquidity positions. These plans evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances and allow us to ensure that we would be able to operate though a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding is constrained. The plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period, and define roles and responsibilities. They are reviewed and approved annually by ALCO. Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. The credit ratings of Bank of America Corporation and Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A.) are reflected in the table below. Table 7 Credit Ratings December 31, 2005 Bank of America Corporation Bank of America, N.A. Senior Debt Subordinated Debt Commercial Paper Short-term Borrowings Long-term Debt Moody Aa2 Aa3 P-1 P-1 Aa1 Standard & Poor AA- A+ A-1+ A-1+ AA Fitch, Inc. AA- A+ F1+ F1+ AA- 47 Table of Contents Under normal business conditions, primary sources of funding for the parent company include dividends received from its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of senior and subordinated debt, as well as commercial paper and equity. Primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt and commercial paper, share repurchases, dividends paid to shareholders, and subsidiary funding through capital or debt. The parent company maintains a cushion of excess liquidity that would be sufficient to fully fund holding company and nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period during which funding from normal sources is disrupted. The primary measure used to assess the parent company liquidity is the Time to Required Funding during such a period of liquidity disruption. This measure assumes that the parent company is unable to generate funds from debt or equity issuance, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries, and no longer pays dividends to shareholders while continuing to meet nondiscretionary uses needed to maintain bank operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent company and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered the Time to Required Funding . ALCO approves the target range set for this metric, in months, and monitors adherence to the target. Maintaining excess parent company cash that ensures that Time to Required Funding remains in the target range is the primary driver of the timing and amount of the Corporation debt issuances. As of December 31, 2005 Time to Required Funding was 29 months. The primary sources of funding for our banking subsidiaries include customer deposits, wholesale market based funding, and asset securitizations. Primary uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include growth in the core asset portfolios, including loan demand, and in the ALM portfolio. We use the ALM portfolio primarily to manage interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The strength of our balance sheet is a result of rigorous financial and risk discipline. Our excess deposits, which are a low cost of funding source, fund the purchase of additional securities and result in a lower loan to deposit ratio. Mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans have prepayment risk which has to be actively managed. Repricing of deposits is a key variable in this process. The capital generated in excess of capital adequacy targets and to support business growth, is available for the payment of dividends and share repurchases. ALCO determines prudent parameters for wholesale market-based borrowing and regularly reviews the funding plan for the bank subsidiaries to ensure compliance with these parameters. The contingency funding plan for the banking subsidiaries evaluates liquidity over a 12-month period in a variety of business environment scenarios assuming different levels of earnings performance and credit ratings as well as public and investor relations factors. Funding exposure related to our role as liquidity provider to certain off-balance sheet financing entities is also measured under a stress scenario. In this analysis, ratings are downgraded such that the off-balance sheet financing entities are not able to issue commercial paper and backup facilities that we provide are drawn upon. In addition, potential draws on credit facilities to issuers with ratings below a certain level are analyzed to assess potential funding exposure. One ratio used to monitor the stability of our funding composition is the loan to domestic deposit (LTD) ratio. This ratio reflects the percent of Loans and Leases that are funded by domestic customer deposits, a relatively stable funding source. A ratio below 100 percent indicates that our loan portfolio is completely funded by domestic customer deposits. The ratio was 102 percent at December 31, 2005 compared to 93 percent at December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to organic growth in the loan and lease portfolio. We originate loans for retention on our balance sheet and for distribution. As part of our originate to distribute strategy, commercial loan originations are distributed through syndication structures, and residential mortgages originated by Consumer Real Estate are frequently distributed in the secondary market. In connection with our balance sheet management activities, we may retain mortgage loans originated as well as purchase and sell loans based on our assessment of market conditions. Regulatory Capital As a regulated financial services company, we are governed by certain regulatory capital requirements. Presented in Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements are the regulatory capital ratios, actual capital amounts and minimum required capital amounts for the Corporation, Bank of America, N.A., Fleet National Bank and Bank of America, N.A. (USA) at December 31, 2005 and 2004. On June 13, 2005, Fleet National Bank merged with and into Bank of America, N.A., with Bank of America, N.A. as the surviving entity. As of December 31, 2005, the entities were classified as well-capitalized for regulatory purposes, the highest classification. Certain corporate sponsored trust companies which issue trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) are deconsolidated under FIN 46R. As a result, the Trust Securities are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On March 1, 2005, the FRB issued Risk-Based Capital Standards: Trust Preferred Securities and the Definition of Capital (the Final Rule) which allows Trust Securities to continue to qualify as Tier 1 Capital with revised quantitative limits that would be effective after a five-year transition period. As a result, we continue to include Trust Securities in Tier 1 Capital. 48 Table of Contents The FRB Final Rule limits restricted core capital elements to 15 percent for internationally active bank holding companies. In addition, the FRB revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital. Internationally active bank holding companies are those with consolidated assets greater than $250 billion or on-balance sheet exposure greater than $10 billion. At December 31, 2005, our restricted core capital elements comprised 16.6 percent of total core capital elements. We expect to be fully compliant with the revised limits prior to the implementation date of March 31, 2009. Basel II In June 2004, Basel II was published with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks. Similar to economic capital measures, Basel II seeks to address credit risk, market risk and operational risk. While economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, we also maintain a certain threshold in terms of regulatory capital to adhere to legal standards of capital adequacy. With recent updates to the U.S. implementation, these thresholds or leverage ratios, will continue to be utilized for the foreseeable future. Maintaining capital adequacy with our regulatory capital under Basel II, does not impact internal profitability or pricing. In the U.S., Basel II will not be implemented until January 1, 2008, which will serve as our parallel test year, followed by full implementation in 2009. The impact on our capital management processes and capital requirements continues to be evaluated. As Basel II is an international regulation, U.S. regulatory agencies are drafting a U.S. oriented measure which follows the Basel II construct. Recently, an assessment of the potential effect on regulatory capital known as Quantitative Impact Study 4 was completed, which generated disparate results among participants. In order to address the potential changes in capital levels, regulators have established floors or limits as to how much capital can decrease from period to period after full implementation through at least 2011. We are committed to working with the regulators and continue to proactively monitor their efforts towards achieving a successful implementation of Basel II. Implementation of Basel II requires a significant enterprise-wide effort. During 2005, our dedicated Basel II Program Management Office, supported by a number of business segment specialists and technologists, completed major planning activities required to achieve Basel II preparedness. During 2006, we are aggressively moving forward with policy, process and technology changes required to achieve full compliance by the start of parallel processing in 2008. We continue to work closely with the regulatory agencies in this process. Dividends Effective for the third quarter 2005 dividend, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend 11 percent from $0.45 to $0.50 per common share. In October 2005, the Board declared a fourth quarter cash dividend which was paid on December 23, 2005 to common shareholders of record on December 2, 2005. In January 2006, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per common share payable on March 24, 2006 to shareholders of record on March 3, 2006. Share Repurchases We will continue to repurchase shares, from time to time, in the open market or in private transactions through our approved repurchase programs. We repurchased 126.4 million shares of common stock in 2005, which more than offset the 79.6 million shares issued under our company employee stock plans. During 2006 we expect to use available excess capital to repurchase shares in excess of shares issued under our employee stock plans. For additional information on common share repurchases, see Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty inability to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications, including loans and leases, derivatives, trading account assets, assets held-for-sale, and unfunded lending commitments that include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us completely fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current mark-to-market value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures take into account credit exposures that are funded or unfunded. For additional information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Notes 5 and 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our Loans and Leases as either consumer or commercial and monitor their credit risk separately as discussed below. Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques are used to establish product pricing, risk appetite, operating processes and metrics to balance risks and returns. Consumer exposure is grouped by product and other attributes for purposes of evaluating credit risk. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus as well as internal historical experience. These models are essential to our consumer credit risk management process and are used in the determination of credit decisions, collections management strategies, portfolio management decisions, determination of the allowance for consumer loan and lease losses, and economic capital allocations for credit risk. Table 8 presents outstanding consumer loans and leases for each year in the five-year period ending at December 31, 2005.

Concentrations of Consumer Credit Risk Our consumer credit risk is diversified both geographically and through our various product offerings. In addition, credit decisions are statistically based with tolerances set to decrease the percentage of approvals as the risk profile increases. From time to time, we purchase credit protection on certain portions of our consumer portfolio. This protection is designed to enhance our overall risk management strategy. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we have mitigated a portion of our credit risk on approximately $110.4 billion and $88.7 billion of residential mortgage and indirect automobile loans through the purchase of credit protection. Our regulatory risk-weighted assets were reduced as a result of these transactions because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. These transactions had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $30.6 billion and $25.5 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and resulted in 28 bp and 26 bp increases in our Tier 1 Capital ratio. Consumer Portfolio Credit Quality Performance Credit quality continued to be strong and consistent with performance from a year ago with the exception of the credit card portfolio. Managed credit card performance was impacted by increased bankruptcy filings prior to legislation which became effective October 17, 2005, continued growth and seasoning of the portfolio, and increased minimum payment requirements implemented in April 2004. The year 2005 compared to 2004 was also impacted by the FleetBoston credit card portfolio. The entire balance of an account is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified date on the customer billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on our past due loans until the date the loan goes into nonaccrual status, if applicable. Delinquency is reported on accruing loans that are 30 days or more past due. 50 Table of Contents Credit card loans are generally charged off at 180 days past due or 60 days from notification of bankruptcy filing and are not classified as nonperforming. Unsecured consumer loans and deficiencies in non-real estate secured loans and leases are charged off at 120 days past due and are generally not classified as nonperforming. Real estate secured consumer loans are placed on nonaccrual and are classified as nonperforming no later than 90 days past due. The amount deemed uncollectible on real estate secured loans is charged off at 180 days past due. Table 9 presents consumer net charge-offs and net charge-off ratios on the held portfolio for 2005 and 2004. Table 9 Consumer Net Charge-offs and Net Charge-off Ratios (1) 2005 2004 (Restated) (Dollars in millions) Amount Percent Amount Percent Residential mortgage $ 27 0.02 % $ 36 0.02 % Credit card 3,652 6.76 2,305 5.31 Home equity lines 31 0.05 15 0.04 Direct/Indirect consumer 248 0.55 208 0.55 Other consumer 275 3.99 193 2.51 Total consumer $ 4,233 1.26 % $ 2,757 0.93 % (1) Percentage amounts are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases during the year for each loan category. As presented in Table 9, consumer net charge-offs from on-balance sheet loans increased $1.5 billion to $4.2 billion in 2005. Of these increased amounts, $1.3 billion was related to credit card net charge-offs. Higher credit card net charge-offs were driven by an increase in bankruptcy net charge-offs of $578 million resulting from changes in bankruptcy legislation, organic portfolio growth and seasoning, increases effective in 2004 in credit card minimum payment requirements, the impact of the FleetBoston portfolio and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts. The increase in direct/indirect consumer charge-offs was driven primarily by the growth and seasoning of the auto loan portfolio. The increase in other consumer charge-offs was primarily driven by an increase in charge-offs for checking account overdraft balances due to deposit growth and a change in the fourth quarter of 2005 in our charge-off policy for overdraft balances from 120 days to 60 days. Net losses for the managed credit card portfolio increased $1.3 billion to $4.1 billion, or 6.92 percent of total average managed credit card loans in 2005, compared to 5.62 percent of total average managed credit card loans in 2004. Higher managed credit card net losses were driven by an increase in bankruptcy net losses resulting from the change in bankruptcy law, continued portfolio growth and seasoning, increases effective in 2004 in credit card minimum payment requirements and the impact of the FleetBoston portfolio. As presented in Table 10, nonperforming consumer assets increased $39 million from December 31, 2004 to $846 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was due to a $47 million increase in nonperforming consumer loans and leases to $785 million, representing 0.22 percent of outstanding consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2005 compared to $738 million, representing 0.23 percent of outstanding consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2004. Nonperforming residential mortgages increased $16 million primarily due to modest portfolio growth, partially offset by sales of $112 million in 2005. Nonperforming home equity lines increased $51 million due to the seasoning of the portfolio. Other consumer nonperforming loans and leases fell $24 million due to the continued liquidation of the portfolios in our previously exited consumer businesses and a decline in foreign nonperforming loans and leases. Broad-based loan growth offset the increase in nonperforming consumer loans resulting in an improvement in the nonperforming ratios. 51 Table of Contents Table 10 Nonperforming Consumer Assets December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases Residential mortgage $ 570 $ 554 $ 531 $ 612 $ 556 Home equity lines 117 66 43 66 80 Direct/Indirect consumer 37 33 28 30 27 Other consumer 61 85 36 25 16 Total nonperforming consumer loans and leases (1) 785 738 638 733 679 Consumer foreclosed properties 61 69 81 99 334 Total nonperforming consumer assets (2) $ 846 $ 807 $ 719 $ 832 $ 1,013 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (Restated) 0.22 % 0.23 % 0.27 % 0.37 % 0.41 % Nonperforming consumer assets as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (Restated) 0.24 0.25 0.30 0.42 0.61 (1) In 2005, $50 million in Interest Income was estimated to be contractually due on nonperforming consumer loans and leases classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2005 provided that these loans and leases had been paid according to their terms and conditions. Of this amount, approximately $9 million was received and included in Net Income for 2005. (2) Balances do not include $5 million, $28 million, $16 million, $41 million, and $646 million of nonperforming consumer loans held-for-sale, included in Other Assets at December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Table 11 presents the additions and reductions to nonperforming assets in the consumer portfolio during 2005 and 2004. Net additions to nonperforming loans and leases in 2005 were $47 million compared to $100 million in 2004.

(2) Our policy is not to classify consumer credit card and consumer non-real estate loans and leases as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans are not included above. 52 Table of Contents On-balance sheet consumer loans and leases 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005, and were up $131 million from December 31, 2004, primarily driven by a $122 million increase in credit card past due loans due to continued seasoning and growth. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of the borrower or counterparty financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower or counterparty, each commercial credit exposure or transaction is assigned a risk rating and is subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis. If necessary, risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the borrower or counterparty financial condition, cash flow or financial situation. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. Risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses. In making decisions regarding credit, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship and SVA. Our lines of business and Risk Management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor a borrower or counterparty ability to perform under its obligations. Additionally, we utilize syndication of exposure to other entities, loan sales and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the loan portfolio. Table 12 presents outstanding commercial loans and leases for each year in the five-year period ending December 31, 2005.

Concentrations of Commercial Credit Risk Portfolio credit risk is evaluated and managed with a goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure, and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography and customer relationship. Distribution of loans and leases by loan size is an additional measure of the portfolio risk diversification. We also review, measure, and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our international portfolio, we evaluate borrowings by region and by country. Tables 13 through 19 summarize these concentrations. From the perspective of portfolio risk management, customer concentration management is most relevant in Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking . Within that portfolio, concentrations are actively managed through the underwriting and ongoing monitoring processes, the established strategy of originate to distribute , and partly through the purchase of credit protection through credit derivatives. We utilize various risk mitigation tools to economically hedge our risk to certain credit counterparties. Credit derivatives are financial instruments that we purchase for protection against the deterioration of credit quality. Earnings volatility increases due to accounting asymmetry as we mark to market the CDS, as required by SFAS 133, while the loans are recorded at historical cost less an allowance for credit losses or, if held-for-sale, at the lower of cost or market. 53 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a net notional amount of credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio of $14.7 billion and $10.8 billion. Our credit portfolio hedges, including the impact of mark-to-market, resulted in net gains of $49 million in 2005 and net losses of $144 million in 2004. Gains for 2005 primarily reflected the impact of spread widening in certain industries in the first half of the year. Table 13 shows commercial utilized credit exposure by industry based on Standard & Poor industry classifications and includes commercial loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, derivative assets, assets held-for-sale, and commercial letters of credit. These amounts exclude the impact of our credit hedging activities, which are separately included in the table. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. A negative notional amount indicates a net amount of protection purchased in a particular industry; conversely, a positive notional amount indicates a net amount of protection sold in a particular industry. Credit protection is purchased to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of credit exposure. As shown in the table below, commercial utilized credit exposure is diversified across a range of industries.

The amounts outstanding exclude commercial loans and leases secured by owner-occupied real estate. Commercial loans and leases secured by owner-occupied real estate are made on the general creditworthiness of the borrower where real estate is obtained as additional security and the ultimate repayment of the credit is not dependent on the sale, lease and rental, or refinancing of the real estate. For purposes of this table, commercial real estate reflects loans dependent on the sale, lease and rental, or refinancing of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.

Foreign Portfolio Table 17 sets forth total foreign exposure broken out by region at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Total foreign exposure is defined to include credit exposure, net of local liabilities, plus securities and other investments for all exposure with a country of risk other than the United States. Table 17 Regional Foreign Exposure (1) December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Europe $ 61,953 $ 62,428 Asia Pacific (2) 14,113 10,736 Latin America (3) 10,651 10,948 Middle East 616 527 Africa 110 238 Other (4) 4,778 5,327 Total $ 92,221 $ 90,204 (1) Reflects the subtraction of local funding or liabilities from local exposures as allowed by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). (2) Includes Australia and New Zealand. (3) Includes Bermuda and Cayman Islands. (4) Other includes Canada and supranational entities. 56 Table of Contents Our total foreign exposure was $92.2 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of $2.0 billion from December 31, 2004. Our foreign exposure was concentrated in Europe, which accounted for $62.0 billion, or 67 percent, of total foreign exposure. The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was distributed across a variety of industries with the largest concentration in the banking sector that accounted for 47 percent of the total exposure in Europe. At December 31, 2005, the United Kingdom and Germany were the only countries whose total cross-border outstandings exceeded 0.75 percent of our total assets. Our second largest foreign exposure of $14.1 billion, or 15 percent, was in Asia Pacific as growth in the total foreign exposure during 2005 was concentrated in that region. Our $3.0 billion equity investment in CCB was the most significant driver of the growth. Latin America accounted for $10.7 billion, or 12 percent, of total foreign exposure. The decline in exposure in Latin America during 2005 was primarily due to the sales of branch assets in Peru, Colombia and Panama as well as the reduction of exposure in Argentina, partially offset by an increase in Mexico. For more information on our Asia Pacific and Latin America exposure, see discussion in the foreign exposure to selected countries defined as emerging markets on page 58. As shown in Table 18, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the United Kingdom had total cross-border exposure of $22.9 billion and $11.9 billion, representing 1.78 percent and 1.07 percent of total assets. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Germany had total cross-border exposure of $12.5 billion and $12.0 billion, representing 0.97 percent and 1.08 percent of total assets. At December 31, 2005, the largest concentration of the exposure to these countries was in the private sector. Table 18 Total Cross-border Exposure Exceeding One Percent of Total Assets (1,2) (Dollars in millions) December 31 Public Sector Banks Private Sector Cross- border Exposure Exposure as a Percentage of Total Assets (Restated) United Kingdom 2005 $ 298 $ 8,915 $ 13,727 $ 22,940 1.78 % 2004 74 3,239 8,606 11,919 1.07 2003 143 3,426 6,552 10,121 1.41 Germany 2005 $ 285 $ 5,751 $ 6,484 $ 12,520 0.97 % 2004 659 6,251 5,081 11,991 1.08 2003 441 3,436 2,978 6,855 0.95 (1) Exposure includes cross-border claims by our foreign offices as follows: loans, accrued interest receivable, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading account assets, securities, derivative assets, other interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts also include unused commitments, SBLCs, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees. Sector definitions are based on the FFIEC instructions for preparing the Country Exposure Report. (2) The total cross-border exposure for the United Kingdom and Germany at December 31, 2005 includes derivatives exposure of $2.3 billion and $3.4 billion, against which we hold collateral totaling $1.9 billion and $2.6 billion. As shown in Table 19, at December 31, 2005, foreign exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets increased by $1.6 billion to $17.2 billion compared to $15.6 billion at December 31, 2004, and represented 19 percent and 17 percent of total foreign exposure at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005, 51 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Asia Pacific, compared to 40 percent at December 31, 2004. Asia Pacific emerging markets exposure increased by $2.4 billion due to our $3.0 billion equity investment in CCB partially offset by declines in other countries. At December 31, 2005, 48 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Latin America compared to 58 percent at December 31, 2004. Driving the decrease in Latin America were mostly lower exposures in Other Latin America and Argentina, partially offset by an increase in Mexico. Lower exposures in Other Latin America were attributable to the sales of branch assets in Peru, Colombia and Panama, as well as lower securities trading exposure in Venezuela. The reduction in Argentina was mostly in cross-border exposure. Our 24.9 percent investment in Grupo Financiero Santander Serfin accounted for $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion of reported exposure in Mexico at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Our largest exposure in Latin America was in Brazil. Our exposure in Brazil at December 31, 2005 and 2004 included $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion of traditional cross-border credit exposure (Loans and Leases, letters of credit, etc.), and $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion of local country exposure net of local liabilities. We had risk mitigation instruments associated with certain exposures in Brazil, including structured trade related transfer risk mitigation of $830 million and $950 million, third party funding of $313 million and $286 million, and 57 Table of Contents linked certificates of deposit of $59 million and $125 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The resulting total foreign exposure net of risk mitigation for Brazil was $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004. On October 13, 2005, we announced an agreement to sell our asset management business in Mexico with $1.8 billion of assets under management to an entity in which we have a 24.9 percent investment. The sale will be completed in 2006. In December 2005, we entered into a definitive agreement with a consortium led by Johannesburg-based Standard Bank Group Ltd for the sale of BankBoston Argentina assets and the assumption of liabilities. The transaction is subject to obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals. Table 19 sets forth regional foreign exposure to selected countries defined as emerging markets.

The definition that we use includes all countries in Latin America excluding Cayman Islands and Bermuda; all countries in Asia Pacific excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand; and all countries in Central and Eastern Europe excluding Greece. (2) Includes acceptances, SBLCs, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees. (3) Derivative assets are reported on a mark-to-market basis and have not been reduced by the amount of collateral applied. Derivative asset collateral totaled $58 million and $361 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. (4) Generally, cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty because the counterparty has the legal obligation for repayment except where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasuries, in which case the domicile is the U.S., and therefore, excluded from this presentation. For regulatory reporting under FFIEC guidelines, cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the issuer of the securities that are held as collateral. (5) Cross-border exposure includes amounts payable to us by borrowers or counterparties with a country of residence other than the one in which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, consistent with FFIEC reporting rules. (6) Local country exposure includes amounts payable to us by borrowers with a country of residence in which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated. Management subtracts local funding or liabilities from local exposures as allowed by the FFIEC. Total amount of available local liabilities funding local country exposure at December 31, 2005 was $24.2 billion compared to $17.2 billion at December 31, 2004. Local liabilities at December 31, 2005 in Asia Pacific and Latin America were $13.6 billion and $10.6 billion of which $8.4 billion were in Hong Kong, $5.3 billion in Brazil, $3.1 billion in Singapore, $1.7 billion in Argentina, $1.6 billion in Chile, $1.2 billion in Mexico, $782 million in India and $718 million in Uruguay. There were no other countries with available local liabilities funding local country exposure greater than $500 million. (7) Securities/Other Investments includes equity investment of $3.0 billion in CCB. (8) Other Asia Pacific, Other Latin America, and Central and Eastern Europe include countries each with total foreign exposure of less than $300 million. 58 Table of Contents Commercial Portfolio Credit Quality Performance Overall commercial credit quality continued to improve in 2005; however, the rate of improvement slowed in the second half of the year. Table 20 presents commercial net charge-offs and net charge-off ratios for 2005 and 2004. Table 20 Commercial Net Charge-offs and Net Charge-off Ratios (1) 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Amount Percent Amount Percent Commercial domestic $ 170 0.13 % $ 177 0.15 % Commercial real estate (3 ) (0.01 ) Commercial lease financing 231 1.13 9 0.05 Commercial foreign (72 ) (0.39 ) 173 1.05 Total commercial $ 329 0.16 % $ 356 0.20 % (1) Percentage amounts are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases during the year for each loan category. Commercial net charge-offs were $329 million for 2005 compared to $356 million for 2004. Commercial lease financing net charge-offs increased $222 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the domestic airline industry. Commercial foreign net recoveries were $72 million in 2005 compared to net charge-offs of $173 million in 2004. Recoveries were centered in Bermuda, Latin America, India and the United Kingdom. Commercial foreign net charge-offs of $173 million in 2004 were primarily related to one borrower in the food products industry. As presented in Table 21, commercial criticized credit exposure decreased $2.7 billion, or 27 percent, to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2005. The net decrease was driven by $9.9 billion of paydowns, payoffs, credit quality improvements, charge-offs principally related to the domestic airline industry, and loan sales. Reductions were distributed across many industries of which the largest were airlines, utilities and media. These decreases were partially offset by $7.2 billion of newly criticized exposure. Global Business and Financial Services accounted for 54 percent, or $1.5 billion, of the decrease in commercial criticized exposure centered in Commercial Aviation , Latin America and Middle Market Banking, which comprised 20 percent, 15 percent and 9 percent of the total decrease. Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking accounted for 33 percent, or $896 million, of the decrease in criticized exposure. Table 21 Commercial Criticized Exposure (1) December 31 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Amount Percent (2) Amount Percent (2) Commercial domestic $ 5,259 2.62 % $ 6,340 3.38 % Commercial real estate 723 1.63 1,028 2.54 Commercial lease financing 611 2.95 1,347 6.38 Commercial foreign 934 1.73 1,534 3.12 Total commercial criticized exposure $ 7,527 2.35 % $ 10,249 3.44 % (1) Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories defined by regulatory authorities. Exposure amounts include loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, derivative assets, assets held-for-sale and commercial letters of credit. (2) Commercial criticized exposure is taken as a percentage of total commercial utilized exposure. We routinely review the loan and lease portfolio to determine if any credit exposure should be placed on nonperforming status. An asset is placed on nonperforming status when it is determined that full collection of principal and/or interest in accordance with its contractual terms is not probable. As presented in Table 22, nonperforming commercial assets decreased $891 million to $757 million at December 31, 2005 due primarily to the $749 million decrease in nonperforming commercial loans and leases. The decrease in total nonperforming commercial loans and leases primarily resulted from paydowns and payoffs of $686 million, gross charge-offs of $669 million, returns to performing status of $152 million and loan sales of $108 million. These decreases were partially offset by new nonaccrual loans of $929 million. 59 Table of Contents Nonperforming commercial domestic loans and leases decreased by $274 million and represented 0.41 percent of commercial domestic loans and leases at December 31, 2005 compared to 0.70 percent at December 31, 2004. The improvement in the percentage of nonperforming commercial domestic to total commercial domestic was driven by a broad-based decrease in nonperforming loans and leases across several industries, the largest of which were utilities, and metals and mining. Nonperforming commercial lease financing decreased $204 million primarily due to the previously mentioned charge-offs associated with the domestic airline industry, and represented 0.30 percent of commercial lease financing at December 31, 2005 compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2004. Nonperforming commercial foreign decreased $233 million and represented 0.16 percent of commercial foreign at December 31, 2005 compared to 1.45 percent at December 31, 2004. The improvement in the percentage of nonperforming commercial foreign to total commercial foreign was attributable to Latin America. The $140 million decrease in nonperforming securities from December 31, 2004 was primarily driven by an exchange of nonperforming securities for performing securities in Argentina that resulted from the completion of a government mandated securities exchange program. Table 22 presents nonperforming commercial assets for each year in the five-year period ending December 31, 2005. Table 22 Nonperforming Commercial Assets December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Nonperforming commercial loans and leases Commercial domestic $ 581 $ 855 $ 1,388 $ 2,621 $ 2,991 Commercial real estate 49 87 142 164 243 Commercial lease financing 62 266 127 160 134 Commercial foreign 34 267 578 1,359 459 Total nonperforming commercial loans and leases (1) 726 1,475 2,235 4,304 3,827 Nonperforming securities (2) 140 Commercial foreclosed properties 31 33 67 126 68 Total nonperforming commercial assets (3) $ 757 $ 1,648 $ 2,302 $ 4,430 $ 3,895 Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases 0.33 % 0.76 % 1.70 % 2.96 % 2.33 % Nonperforming commercial assets as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties 0.35 0.85 1.75 3.05 2.38 (1) In 2005, $51 million in Interest Income was estimated to be contractually due on nonperforming commercial loans and leases classified as nonperforming at December 31, 2005, including troubled debt restructured loans of which $31 million were performing at December 31, 2005 and not included in the table above. Approximately $15 million of the estimated $51 million in contractual interest was received and included in net income for 2005. (2) Primarily related to international securities held in the AFS portfolio. (3) Balances do not include $45 million, $123 million, $186 million, $73 million, and $289 million of nonperforming commercial assets, primarily commercial loans held-for-sale, included in Other Assets at December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. 60 Table of Contents Table 23 presents the additions and reductions to nonperforming assets in the commercial portfolio during 2005 and 2004.

(2) Certain loan and lease products, including commercial credit card, are not classified as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans are not included above. 61 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005, Other Assets included commercial loans held-for-sale of $7.3 billion, of which $45 million was nonperforming, and leveraged lease partnership interests of $183 million. At December 31, 2005, there were no nonperforming leveraged lease partnership interests. At December 31, 2004, Other Assets included $1.3 billion and $198 million of commercial loans held-for-sale and leveraged lease partnership interests, of which, $100 million and $23 million were nonperforming. Commercial loans and leases 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest, were $168 million at December 31, 2005, an increase of $30 million compared to December 31, 2004. The increase was driven by commercial foreign loans in the U.K. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on past due commercial loans and leases. Provision for Credit Losses The Provision for Credit Losses was $4.0 billion, a 45 percent increase over 2004. The consumer portion of the Provision for Credit Losses increased $992 million to $4.4 billion in 2005, primarily driven by consumer net charge-offs of $4.2 billion. Credit card net charge-offs increased $1.3 billion from 2004 to $3.7 billion with an estimated $578 million related to the increase in bankruptcy filings as customers rushed to file ahead of the new law. Also contributing to the increase in credit card net charge-offs were organic growth and seasoning of the portfolio, increases effective in 2004 in credit card minimum payment requirements, the impact of the FleetBoston portfolio and the impact of new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts. We estimate that approximately 70 percent of the bankruptcy-related charge-offs represent acceleration of charge-offs from 2006. Excluding bankruptcy-related charge-offs representing acceleration from 2006 and charge-offs associated with the 2004 changes in credit card minimum payment requirements that were provided for in late 2004, the increased credit card net charge-offs were the primary driver of higher Provision for Credit Losses. In addition, the Provision for Credit Losses was impacted by new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts, and the establishment of reserves in 2005 for additional changes made in late 2005 in credit card minimum payment requirements. The establishment of a $50 million reserve associated with Hurricane Katrina for estimated losses on residential mortgage, home equity and indirect automobile products also contributed to the provision increase. The commercial portion of the Provision for Credit Losses increased $161 million to negative $370 million. The negative provision in 2005 reflects continued improvement in commercial credit quality, although at a slower pace than experienced in 2004. An improved risk profile in Latin America and reduced uncertainties resulting from the completion of credit-related integration activities for FleetBoston also drove the negative provision. The Provision for Credit Losses related to unfunded lending commitments increased $92 million to negative $7 million as the rate of improvement in commercial credit quality slowed. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses is allocated based on two components. We evaluate the adequacy of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses based on the combined total of these two components. The first component of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses covers those commercial loans that are either nonperforming or impaired. An allowance is allocated when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) are lower than the carrying value of that loan. For purposes of computing the specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product type and risk rating of the loans. The second component of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses covers performing commercial loans and leases, and consumer loans. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic or obligor concentrations within each portfolio segment, and any other pertinent information. The commercial historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2005, quarterly updating of historical loss experience did not have a material impact to the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses. The allowance for consumer loan and lease losses is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized for consumer products that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. These consumer loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis in order to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2005, quarterly updating of the loss forecast models to reflect estimated bankruptcy-related net charge-offs accelerated from 2006 resulted in a decrease in the allowance for consumer loan and lease losses. 62 Table of Contents Included within the second component of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses are previously unallocated reserves maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of probable losses including the imprecision inherent in the forecasting methodologies, domestic and global economic uncertainty, large single name defaults and event risk. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we assigned these reserves to our individual products to better reflect our view of risk in these portfolios. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Additions to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses are made by charges to the Provision for Credit Losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in Table 25 increased $137 million from December 31, 2004 to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2005. Credit card accounted for $153 million of this increase and was primarily driven by new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts, organic growth and continued seasoning which resulted in higher loss expectations. These increases were mostly offset by the use of reserves to absorb the estimated bankruptcy net charge-off acceleration from 2006. Increases in the allowance for non-credit card consumer products were driven by broad-based loan growth and seasoning, with the exception of the other consumer product category which decreased as a result of the run-off portfolios from our previously exited consumer businesses. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was $3.5 billion at December 31, 2005, a $718 million decrease from December 31, 2004. This decrease resulted from continued improvement in commercial credit quality, including reduced exposure and an improved risk profile in Latin America, the use of reserves to absorb a portion of domestic airline charge-offs and a reduction of reserves due to reduced uncertainties resulting from the completion of credit-related integration activities for FleetBoston during 2005. Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews, and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, current economic conditions and performance trends within specific portfolio segments, and any other pertinent information result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred credit losses upon draws of the commitments. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of credit portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are made through the Provision for Credit Losses. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2005 was $395 million, a decrease of $7 million from December 31, 2004. 63 Table of Contents Table 24 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for five years ending December 31, 2005.

Information was not available to assign general reserves by product types prior to 2003. n/a = Not available; included in commercial domestic at December 31, 2002 and 2001. Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market movements. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business, our customer and proprietary trading operations, our ALM process, credit risk mitigation activities, and mortgage banking activities. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). While the accounting rules require a historical cost view of traditional banking assets and liabilities, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions. Interest rate risk is the effect of changes in the economic value of our loans and deposits, as well as our other interest rate sensitive instruments, and is reflected in the levels of future income and expense produced by these positions versus levels that would be generated by current levels of interest rates. We seek to mitigate interest rate risk as part of the ALM process. We seek to mitigate trading risk within our prescribed risk appetite using hedging techniques. Trading positions are reported at estimated market value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as equity, mortgage, commodity and issuer risk factors. We seek to mitigate these risk exposures by utilizing a variety of financial instruments. The following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposures we have to instruments whose values vary with the level of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments. We seek to mitigate risks associated with the exposures in a variety of ways that typically involve taking offsetting positions in cash or derivative markets. The cash and derivative 65 Table of Contents instruments allow us to seek to mitigate risks by reducing the effect of movements in the level of interest rates, changes in the shape of the yield curve as well as changes in interest rate volatility. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include related derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposures we have to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans, foreign currency-denominated securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates. Instruments used to mitigate this risk are foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards and deposits. These instruments help insulate us against losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates. Mortgage Risk Our exposure to mortgage risk takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities, including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages, and collateralized mortgage obligations. Second, we originate a variety of asset-backed securities, which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage activities. See Notes 1 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on MSRs. These activities generate market risk since these instruments are sensitive to changes in the level of market interest rates, changes in mortgage prepayments and interest rate volatility. Options, futures, forwards, swaps, swaptions and mortgage-backed securities are used to hedge mortgage risk by seeking to mitigate the effects of changes in interest rates. Equity Market Risk Equity market risk arises from exposure to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of common stock or other equity-linked instruments. The instruments held that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, listed equity options (puts and calls), over-the-counter equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and convertible bonds. We seek to mitigate the risk associated with these securities via hedging on a portfolio or name basis that focuses on reducing volatility from changes in stock prices. Instruments used for risk mitigation include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions. Commodity Risk Commodity risk represents exposures we have to products traded in the petroleum, natural gas, metals and power markets. Our principal exposure to these markets emanates from customer-driven transactions. These transactions consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. We seek to mitigate exposure to the commodity markets with instruments including, but not limited to, options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions. Issuer Credit Risk Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted for various reasons directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage or reduced demand for the issuer goods or services. Perceived changes in the creditworthiness of a particular debtor or sector can have significant effects on the replacement costs of cash and derivative positions. We seek to mitigate the impact of credit spreads, credit migration and default risks on the market value of the trading portfolio with the use of CDS, and credit fixed income and similar securities. Trading Risk Management Trading-related revenues represent the amount earned from our trading positions, which include trading account assets and liabilities, as well as derivative positions and, prior to the conversion of the Certificates into MSRs, market value adjustments to the Certificates and the MSRs. Trading positions are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities, and derivative positions are reported at fair value. MSRs are reported at the lower of cost or market. For more information on fair value, see Complex Accounting Estimates beginning on page 74. For additional information on MSRs, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading Account Profits represent the net amount earned from our trading positions and, as reported in the 66 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Income, do not include the Net Interest Income recognized on trading positions, or the related funding charge or benefit. Trading Account Profits can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading Account Profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. The histogram of daily revenue or loss below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2005. Trading-related revenue encompasses proprietary trading and customer-related activities. During 2005, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 81 percent of the trading days. Furthermore, only six percent of the total trading days had losses greater than $10 million, and the largest loss was $41 million. This can be compared to 2004, where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 87 percent of the trading days and only five percent of the total trading days had losses greater than $10 million, and the largest loss was $27 million. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use Value-at-Risk (VAR) modeling and stress testing. VAR is a key statistic used to measure and manage market risk. Trading limits and VAR are used to manage day-to-day risks and are subject to testing where we compare expected performance to actual performance. This testing provides us a view of our models predictive accuracy. All limit excesses are communicated to senior management for review. A VAR model estimates a range of hypothetical scenarios to calculate a potential loss which is not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level. These estimates are impacted by the nature of the positions in the portfolio and the correlation within the portfolio. Within any VAR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. Our VAR model assumes a 99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times each year. Actual losses did not exceed VAR in 2005 or 2004. In addition to reviewing our underlying model assumptions, we seek to mitigate the uncertainties related to these assumptions and estimates through close monitoring and by updating the assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. If the results of our analysis indicate higher than expected levels of risk, proactive measures are taken to adjust risk levels. 67 Table of Contents The following graph shows actual losses did not exceed VAR in 2005. 68 Table of Contents Table 26 presents average, high and low daily VAR for 2005 and 2004. Table 26 Trading Activities Market Risk Twelve Months Ended December 31 2005 2004 VAR VAR (Dollars in millions) Average High (1) Low (1) Average High (1) Low (1) Foreign exchange $ 5.6 $ 12.1 $ 2.6 $ 3.6 $ 8.1 $ 1.4 Interest rate 24.7 58.2 10.8 26.2 51.5 10.7 Credit (2) 55.4 77.3 35.9 35.7 61.4 21.9 Real estate/mortgage (3) 11.4 20.7 6.5 10.5 26.0 4.6 Equities 18.1 35.1 9.6 21.8 51.5 7.9 Commodities 6.6 10.6 3.5 6.5 10.2 3.8 Portfolio diversification (59.6 ) (56.3 ) Total trading portfolio $ 62.2 $ 92.4 $ 38.0 $ 48.0 $ 78.5 $ 29.4 Total market-based trading portfolio (4) $ 40.7 $ 66.4 $ 26.4 $ 44.1 $ 79.0 $ 23.7 (1) The high and low for the total portfolio may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the individual portfolios may have occurred on different trading days. (2) Credit includes credit fixed income and CDS used for credit risk management. Average VAR for CDS was $69.0 million and $23.5 million in 2005 and 2004. In 2005, the Credit VAR was less than VAR for CDS used for credit risk management as the positions in credit fixed income typically offset the risk of CDS. The relationship between overall Credit VAR and the VAR for CDS can change over time as a result of changes in the relative sizes of the credit fixed income and CDS exposures. (3) Real estate/mortgage includes capital market real estate and the Certificates. Effective June 1, 2004, Real estate/mortgage no longer includes the Certificates. For additional information on the Certificates, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Total market-based trading portfolio excludes CDS used for credit risk management, net of the effect of diversification. The increase in average VAR of the trading portfolio for 2005 was primarily due to increases in the average risk taken in credit due to an increase in credit protection purchased to hedge the credit risk in our commercial loan portfolio. Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VAR model suggests results can exceed our estimates, we stress test our portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio due to abnormal market movements. Various stress scenarios are run regularly against the trading portfolio to verify that, even under extreme market moves, we will preserve our capital; to determine the effects of significant historical events; and to determine the effects of specific, extreme hypothetical, but plausible events. The results of the stress scenarios are calculated daily and reported to senior management as part of the regular reporting process. The results of certain specific, extreme hypothetical scenarios are presented to the Asset and Liability Committee. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading financial instruments. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect Net Interest Income. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our Net Interest Income caused by changes in market interest rates. Client facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. Interest rate risk from these activities as well as the impact of changing market conditions is managed through the ALM process. Sensitivity simulations are used to estimate the impact on Net Interest Income of numerous interest rate scenarios, balance sheet trends and strategies. These simulations estimate levels of short-term financial instruments, debt securities, loans, deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments. In addition, these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics. In addition to Net Interest Income sensitivity simulations, market value sensitivity measures are also utilized. The Balance Sheet Management group maintains a Net Interest Income forecast utilizing different rate scenarios, with the base case utilizing the forward market curve. The Balance Sheet Management group constantly updates the Net Interest Income forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends and market conditions. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to volatile interest rate changes. 69 Table of Contents We prepare forward looking forecasts of Net Interest Income. These baseline forecasts take into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning, and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the markets forward interest rate curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have to these static baseline forecasts in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The spot and 12-month forward rates used in our respective baseline forecasts at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Table 27 Forward Rates December 31 2005 2004 Federal Funds Ten-Year Constant Maturity Swap Federal Funds Ten-Year Constant Maturity Swap Spot rates 4.25 % 4.94 % 2.25 % 4.64 % 12-month forward rates 4.75 4.97 3.25 4.91 The following table reflects the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted Core Net Interest Income over the next twelve months from December 31, 2005 and 2004, resulting from a 100 bp gradual parallel increase, a 100 bp gradual parallel decrease, a 100 bp gradual curve flattening (increase in short-term rates) and a 100 bp gradual curve steepening (increase in long-tem rates) from the forward curve. Table 28 Estimated Net Interest Income at Risk (Dollars in millions) December 31 Curve Change Short Rate Long Rate 2005 2004 (Restated) +100 Parallel shift +100 +100 $ (357 ) $ (183 ) -100 Parallel shift -100 -100 244 (126 ) Flatteners Short end +100 (523 ) (462 ) Long end -100 (298 ) (677 ) Steepeners Short end -100 536 497 Long end +100 168 97 The sensitivity analysis above assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shifts over the indicated years. Beyond what is already implied in the forward curve, we are modestly exposed to rising rates primarily due to increased funding costs. Conversely, we would benefit from falling rates or a steepening of the yield curve beyond what is already implied in the forward curve. As part of the ALM process, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. Securities The securities portfolio is integral to our ALM process. The decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment, liquidity and regulatory requirements, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. During 2005, we purchased securities of $204.5 billion, sold $134.5 billion, and received paydowns of $37.7 billion. During 2004, we purchased securities of $243.6 billion, sold $117.7 billion, and received paydowns of $31.8 billion. During the year, we continuously monitored our interest rate risk position and effected changes in the securities portfolio in order to manage prepayment risk and interest rate risk. Through sales in the securities portfolio, we realized $1.1 billion in Gains on Sales of Debt Securities during 2005 and $1.7 billion during 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower gains realized on mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds. Residential Mortgage Portfolio During 2005, we purchased $32.0 billion of residential mortgages related to the ALM process. We had whole mortgage loan sales of $10.1 billion during 2005. During 2004, we purchased $65.9 billion of residential mortgages related to the ALM process and had minimal sales of whole mortgage loans. Additionally, we received paydowns of $35.8 billion and $44.4 billion for 2005 and 2004. Through sales of whole mortgage loans, we recognized gains that were recorded as Other Income of $45 million for 2005, compared to losses of $2 million in 2004. 70 Table of Contents Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM process and serve as an efficient tool to mitigate our risk. We use derivatives to hedge the changes in cash flows or market values of our balance sheet. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our hedging activities. Our interest rate contracts are generally nonleveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures, and forwards. In addition, we use foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as our equity investments in foreign subsidiaries. Table 29 reflects the notional amounts, fair value, weighted average receive fixed and pay fixed rates, expected maturity, and estimated duration of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The changes in our swap and option positions reflect actions taken associated with interest rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivative portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate environment, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. The notional amount of our net receive fixed swap position (including foreign exchange contracts) decreased $328 million to $22.8 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. The notional amount of our net option position decreased $266.6 billion to $57.2 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. The vast majority of the decrease in the option notional amount was related to terminations and maturities of short duration options which were hedging short-term repricing risk of our liabilities. Included in the futures and forward rate contract amounts are $35.0 billion of forward purchase contracts of mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans at December 31, 2005 settling from January 2006 to April 2006 with an average yield of 5.46 percent and $46.7 billion of forward purchase contracts of mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans at December 31, 2004 that settled from January 2005 to February 2005 with an average yield of 5.26 percent. There were no forward sale contracts of mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2005, compared to $25.8 billion at December 31, 2004 that settled from January 2005 to February 2005 with an average yield of 5.47 percent. 71 Table of Contents The following table includes derivatives utilized in our ALM process, including those designated as SFAS 133 hedges and those used as economic hedges that do not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting treatment. The fair value of net ALM contracts decreased from $3.4 billion at December 31, 2004 to $(386) million at December 31, 2005. The decrease was attributable to decreases in the value of options, foreign exchange contracts and futures and forward rate contracts, partially offset by increases in the value of interest rate swaps. The decrease in the value of options was due to reduction in outstanding option positions due to terminations, maturities and decreases in the values of remaining open options positions. The decrease in the value of foreign exchange contracts was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies during 2005. The decrease in the value of futures and forward rate contracts was due to the impact of increases in interest rates during 2005 on long futures and forward rate contracts.

The net losses on both open and closed derivative instruments recorded in Accumulated OCI net-of-tax at December 31, 2005 was $(4.3) billion. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period when the hedged item affects earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged items. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes to interest and foreign exchange rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at December 31, 2005, the net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: 9 percent within the next year, 57 percent within five years, 82 percent within 10 years, with the remaining 18 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount included in Accumulated OCI for terminated derivative contracts was a loss of $2.5 billion and a gain of $143 million, net-of-tax, at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The decrease was due primarily to the termination of derivative contracts with previously unrealized losses caused by interest rate fluctuations. Mortgage Banking Risk Management Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) on loans intended to be sold are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loan is funded. Loans held-for-sale are subject to interest rate risk from the date of funding until the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used either as an economic hedge of IRLCs and loans held-for-sale, or designated as a cash flow hedge of loans held-for-sale, in which case their net-of-tax unrealized gains and losses are included in Accumulated OCI. At December 31, 2005, the notional amount of derivatives hedging the IRLCs and loans held-for-sale was $26.9 billion. The related net-of-tax unrealized loss on the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges included in Accumulated OCI at December 31, 2005 was $3 million. The notional amount of the IRLCs adjusted for fallout in the pipeline at December 31, 2005 was $4.3 billion. The amount of loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2005 was $6.1 billion. We manage changes in the value of MSRs by entering into derivative financial instruments and by purchasing and selling securities. MSRs are an intangible asset created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. As of December 31, 2005, the MSR balance in Consumer Real Estate was $2.7 billion, or 13 percent higher than December 31, 2004. For more information on Consumer Real Estate MSRs, refer to page 31. We designate certain derivatives such as purchased options and interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of specified MSRs under SFAS 133. At December 31, 2005, the amount of MSRs identified as being hedged by derivatives in accordance with SFAS 133 was approximately $2.3 billion. The notional amount of the derivative contracts designated as SFAS 133 hedges of MSRs at December 31, 2005 was $33.7 billion. The changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the MSRs that are hedged by these derivative contracts. During 2005, the change in value attributed to SFAS 133 hedged MSRs was $291 million, offset by derivative hedge losses of $124 million. In addition, we hold additional derivatives and certain securities (i.e. mortgage-backed securities) as economic hedges of MSRs, which are not designated as SFAS 133 accounting hedges. During 2005, Interest Income from securities used as an economic hedge of MSRs of $18 million was recognized. At December 31, 2005, the amount of MSRs covered by such economic hedges was $250 million. At December 31, 2005, the unrealized loss on AFS Securities held as economic hedges of MSRs was $29 million compared to an unrealized gain of $21 million on December 31, 2004. See Notes 1 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, including system conversions and integration, and external events. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to a diversified financial services company like ours because of the very nature, volume and complexity of our various businesses. In keeping with our management governance structure, the lines of business are responsible for all the risks within the business including operational risks. Such risks are managed through corporate-wide or line of business specific policies and procedures, controls, and monitoring tools. Examples of these include personnel management practices, data reconciliation processes, fraud management units, transaction processing monitoring and analysis, business recovery planning, and new product introduction processes. We approach operational risk from two perspectives, enterprise-wide and line of business-specific. The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, chartered in 2005 as a subcommittee of the Finance Committee, provides consistent communication and oversight of significant operational and compliance issues and oversees the adoption of best practices. Two groups within Risk Management, Compliance Risk Management and Enterprise Operational Risk 73 Table of Contents Management, facilitate the consistency of effective policies, industry best practices, controls and monitoring tools for managing and assessing operational risks across the Corporation. These groups also work with the line of business executives and their Risk Management counterparts to implement appropriate policies, processes and assessments at the line of business level and support groups. Compliance and operational risk awareness is also driven across the Corporation through training and strategic communication efforts. For selected risks, we establish specialized support groups, for example, Information Security and Supply Chain Management. These specialized groups develop corporate-wide risk management practices, such as an information security program and a supplier program to ensure suppliers adopt appropriate policies and procedures when performing work on behalf of the Corporation. These specialized groups also assist the lines of business in the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the needs of the individual businesses. At the line of business level, the Line of Business Risk Executives are responsible for adherence to corporate practices and oversight of all operational risks in the line of business they support. Operational and compliance risk management, working in conjunction with senior line of business executives, have developed key tools to help manage, monitor and summarize operational risk. One tool the businesses and executive management utilize is a corporate-wide self-assessment process, which helps to identify and evaluate the status of risk issues, including mitigation plans, if appropriate. Its goal is to continuously assess changing market and business conditions and evaluate all operational risks impacting the line of business. The self-assessment process assists in identifying emerging operational risk issues and determining at the line of business or corporate level how they should be managed. In addition to information gathered from the self-assessment process, key operational risk indicators have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on both a corporate and a line of business level. More generally, we mitigate operational risk through a broad-based approach to process management and process improvement. Improvement efforts are focused on reduction of variation in outputs. We have a dedicated Quality and Productivity team to manage and certify the process management and improvement efforts. Recent Accounting and Reporting Developments See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued or proposed accounting pronouncements. Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles as described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates are summarized below. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation process that, with the exception of accrued taxes, involves mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the model. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact Net Income. Separate from the possible future impact to Net Income from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet measurement, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is our estimate of probable losses in the loans and leases portfolio and within our unfunded lending commitments. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the Provision for Credit Losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the Credit Risk Management section beginning on page 49 and Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions made in this process, estimates of the portfolio inherent risks and overall collectibility change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries and individual borrowers or counterparties ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include: (i) risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, (ii) market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, (iii) product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, (iv) loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases, (v) adjustments made to assess current events and conditions, (vi) considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and (vii) overall credit conditions. 74 Table of Contents Our Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to commercial loans and leases and to the loss rates used for the consumer and commercial portfolios. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk rating for commercial loans and leases, except loans already risk rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately $894 million at December 31, 2005. The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses as a percentage of loan and lease outstandings at December 31, 2005 was 1.40 percent and this hypothetical increase in the allowance would raise the ratio to approximately 1.56 percent. A 10 percent increase in the loss rates used on the consumer and commercial loan and lease portfolios would increase the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses at December 31, 2005 by approximately $348 million, of which $283 million would relate to consumer and $65 million to commercial. These sensitivity analyses do not represent management expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of a downgrade of one level of the internal credit ratings for commercial loans and leases within a short period of time is remote. The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Trading Account Assets and Liabilities are recorded at fair value, which is primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of Trading Account Assets or Liabilities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies. At December 31, 2005, $4.9 billion, or four percent, of Trading Account Assets were fair valued using these alternative approaches. An immaterial amount of Trading Account Liabilities were fair valued using these alternative approaches at December 31, 2005. Trading Account Profits, which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading Account Profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use trading limits, stress testing and tools such as VAR modeling, which estimates a potential loss which is not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk. At December 31, 2005, the amount of our VAR was $61 million based on a 99 percent confidence level. For more information on VAR, see pages 67 through 69. The fair values of Derivative Assets and Liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality, future servicing costs and other deal specific factors, where appropriate. To ensure the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of Derivative Assets and Liabilities, various processes and controls have been adopted, which include: a Model Validation Policy that requires a review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a Trading Product Valuation Policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business segment. The fair values of Derivative Assets and Liabilities traded in the over-the-counter market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices, and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value the position. The predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable, in which case quantitative based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. At December 31, 2005, the fair values of Derivative Assets and Liabilities determined by these quantitative models were $10.5 billion and $6.4 billion. These amounts reflect the full fair value of the derivatives and do not isolate the discrete value associated with the subjective valuation variable. Further, they represent four percent and three percent of Derivative Assets and Liabilities, before the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2005, there were no changes to the quantitative models, or uses of such models, that resulted in a material adjustment to the income statement. 75 Table of Contents The Corporation recognizes gains and losses at inception of a derivative contract only if the fair value of the contract is evidenced by a quoted market price in an active market, an observable price or other market transaction, or other observable data supporting a valuation model . For those gains and losses not evidenced by the above mentioned market data, the transaction price is used as the fair value of the derivative contract. Any difference between the transaction price and the model fair value is considered an unrecognized gain or loss at inception of the contract. Previously unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in income using the straight line method of amortization over the contractual life of the derivative contract. Earlier recognition of the full unrecognized gain or loss is permitted if the trade is terminated early, subsequent market activity is observed which supports the model fair value of the contract, or significant inputs used in the valuation model become observable. AFS Securities are recorded at fair value, which is generally based on direct market quotes from actively traded markets. Principal Investing Principal Investing is included within Equity Investments and is discussed in more detail in Business Segment Operations beginning on page 26. Principal Investing is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in privately-held and publicly-traded companies at all stages, from start-up to buyout. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund. Some of these companies may need access to additional cash to support their long-term business models. Market conditions and company performance may impact whether funding is available from private investors or the capital markets. Investments with active market quotes are carried at estimated fair value; however, the majority of our investments do not have publicly available price quotations. At December 31, 2005, we had nonpublic investments of $6.1 billion or approximately 95 percent of the total portfolio. Valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment. Management determines values of the underlying investments based on multiple methodologies including in-depth semi-annual reviews of the investee financial statements and financial condition, discounted cash flows, the prospects of the investee industry and current overall market conditions for similar investments. In addition, on a quarterly basis as events occur or information comes to the attention of management that indicates a change in the value of an investment is warranted, investments are adjusted from their original invested amount to estimated fair values at the balance sheet date with changes being recorded in Equity Investment Gains in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Investments are not adjusted above the original amount invested unless there is clear evidence of a fair value in excess of the original invested amount. This evidence is often in the form of a recent transaction in the investment. As part of the valuation process, senior management reviews the portfolio and determines when an impairment needs to be recorded. The Principal Investing portfolio is not material to our Consolidated Balance Sheet, but the impact of the valuation adjustments may be material to our operating results for any particular quarter. Accrued Income Taxes As more fully described in Notes 1 and 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represents the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction. In applying the principles of SFAS 109, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies, can materially affect our operating results for any given quarter. Goodwill and Other Intangibles The nature of and accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles is discussed in detail in Notes 1 and 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The reporting units utilized for this test were those that are one level below the business segments identified on page 26. The impairment test is performed in two steps. The first step of the Goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including Goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, Goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit Goodwill, as defined in SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), with the carrying amount of that Goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of Goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. 76 Table of Contents For Intangible Assets subject to amortization, impairment exists when the carrying amount of the Intangible Asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of the Intangible Asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the Intangible Asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it. An Intangible Asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the Intangible Asset, indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the Intangible Asset exceeds its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the income approach and the market approach and the fair values of the Intangible Assets were determined using the income approach. For purposes of the income approach, discounted cash flows were calculated by taking the net present value of estimated cash flows using a combination of historical results, estimated future cash flows and an appropriate price to earnings multiple. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results. However, these differences have not been material and we believe that this methodology provides a reasonable means to determine fair values. Cash flows were discounted using a discount rate based on expected equity return rates, which was 11 percent for 2005. Expected rates of equity returns were estimated based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. For purposes of the market approach, valuations of reporting units were based on actual comparable market transactions and market earnings multiples for similar industries of the reporting unit. Our evaluations for the year ended December 31, 2005 indicated there was no impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles. 2004 Compared to 2003 The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for 2004 and 2003. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes on pages 89 through 165. In addition, Tables 2 and 3 contain financial data to supplement this discussion. Overview Net Income Net Income totaled $13.9 billion, or $3.64 per diluted common share, in 2004 compared to $10.8 billion, or $3.55 per diluted common share, in 2003. The return on average common shareholders equity was 16.47 percent in 2004 compared to 21.50 percent in 2003. These earnings provided sufficient cash flow to allow us to return $8.8 billion and $9.8 billion in 2004 and 2003, in capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, net of employee stock options exercised. Net Interest Income Net Interest Income on a FTE basis increased $7.5 billion to $28.7 billion in 2004. This increase was driven by the impact of the FleetBoston Merger, higher ALM portfolio levels (primarily consisting of securities and whole loan mortgages), the impact of higher rates, growth in consumer loan levels (primarily credit card and home equity) and higher core deposit funding levels. Partially offsetting these increases were reductions in the large corporate and foreign loan balances, lower trading-related contributions, lower mortgage warehouse levels and the continued runoff of previously exited consumer businesses. The net interest yield on a FTE basis declined nine bps to 3.17 percent in 2004 due to the adverse impact of increased trading-related balances, which have a lower yield than other earning assets. Noninterest Income Noninterest Income increased $3.7 billion to $21.0 billion in 2004, due primarily to increases in Card Income of $1.5 billion, Service Charges of $1.4 billion, Investment and Brokerage Services of $1.2 billion, Equity Investment Gains of $648 million, and Trading Account Profits of $461 million. Card Income increased due to increased fees and interchange income, including the impact of the FleetBoston card portfolio. Investment and Brokerage Services increased due to the impact of the FleetBoston business as well as market appreciation. Service Charges grew driven by organic account growth and the impact of FleetBoston customers. Offsetting these increases was lower Mortgage Banking Income of $1.5 billion due to lower production levels, a decrease in the gains on sales of loans to the secondary market and writedowns of the value of MSRs. Provision for Credit Losses The Provision for Credit Losses declined $70 million to $2.8 billion in 2004 driven by lower commercial net charge-offs of $748 million and continued improvements in credit quality in the commercial loan portfolio. Offsetting these decreases were increases in the Provision for Credit Losses in our consumer credit card portfolio. These increases 77 Table of Contents reflected higher credit card net charge-offs of $791 million in part due to the impact of the FleetBoston credit card portfolio, organic growth and continued seasoning of accounts, and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts. Also contributing to the consumer provision was the establishment of reserves for changes made to card minimum payment requirements. Gains on Sales of Debt Securities Gains on Sales of Debt Securities in 2004 and 2003, were $1.7 billion and $941 million, as we continued to reposition the ALM portfolio in response to interest rate fluctuations and to manage mortgage prepayment risk. Noninterest Expense Noninterest Expense increased $6.9 billion in 2004 from 2003, due primarily to higher Personnel Expense, increased Other General Operating Expense, and higher Merger and Restructuring Charges. Personnel Expense increased $3.0 billion primarily due to the impact of FleetBoston associates. Other General Operating Expense increased $1.5 billion related to the impact of FleetBoston, $370 million of litigation expenses incurred during 2004 and the $285 million related to the mutual fund settlement. Merger and Restructuring Charges were $618 million in connection with the integration of FleetBoston operations. Income Tax Expense Income Tax Expense was $7.0 billion, reflecting an effective tax rate of 33.3 percent, in 2004 compared to $5.0 billion and 31.8 percent, in 2003. The difference in the effective tax rate between years resulted primarily from the application of purchase accounting to certain leveraged leases acquired in the FleetBoston Merger, an increase in state tax expense generally related to higher tax rates in the Northeast and the reduction in 2003 of Income Tax Expense resulting from a tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. Business Segment Operations Global Consumer and Small Business Banking Total Revenue increased $5.6 billion, or 28 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to the impact of FleetBoston. Overall loan and deposit growth from the impact of FleetBoston customers contributed to the $4.9 billion, or 44 percent, increase in Net Interest Income. This increase was largely due to the net effect of growth in consumer loans and leases, deposit balances and ALM activities. Increases in Card Income of 51 percent, and Service Charges of 26 percent drove the $703 million, or eight percent, increase in Noninterest Income. FleetBoston also contributed to the increase in Noninterest Income. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in Mortgage Banking Income of 72 percent. Net Income rose $642 million, or 12 percent, due to the increases in Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income discussed above, offset by increases in the Provision for Credit Losses and Noninterest Expense. Higher credit card net charge-offs, the impact of the FleetBoston credit card portfolio, organic growth and seasoning of credit card accounts, new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts, and increases in card minimum payment requirements resulted in a $1.6 billion, or 97 percent, increase in the Provision for Credit Losses. Noninterest Expense increased $3.0 billion, or 31 percent, due to increases in Processing Costs, Personnel Expense and Other General Operating Expense related to the impact of FleetBoston. Global Business and Financial Services Total Revenue increased $3.4 billion, or 58 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003. Net Interest Income increased $2.3 billion, or 54 percent, largely due to the increase in commercial loans and leases, deposit balances driven by the impact of FleetBoston earning assets and the net results of ALM activities. Noninterest Income increased $1.1 billion, or 68 percent due to increases in Other Noninterest Income and increases in Service Charges, driven by the impact of FleetBoston. Noninterest Expense increased $1.5 billion, or 70 percent, due to the impact of FleetBoston. Net Income rose $1.8 billion, or 85 percent, due to the increases discussed above. Also impacting Net Income was the Provision for Credit Losses which declined $968 million to negative $442 million, driven by a notable improvement in credit quality and a $395 million decrease in net charge-offs. Global Capital Markets and Investment Banking Total Revenue increased $695 million, or eight percent, in 2004 compared to 2003 driven by an increase in Noninterest Income. Net Interest Income decreased $175 million, or four percent, driven by a $196 million, or nine percent decrease in trading-related Net Interest Income. Noninterest Income increased $870 million, or 21 percent, resulting from increases in Trading Account Profits, Investment Banking Income, and Service Charges. In 2004, Net Income increased $174 million, or 10 percent, due to the increase in Noninterest Income and lower Provision for Credit 78 Table of Contents Losses offset by an increase in Noninterest Expense. Provision for Credit Losses declined $753 million to negative $445 million due to a notable improvement in credit quality in the large corporate portfolio and a $312 million reduction in net charge-offs. Noninterest Expense increased by $1.2 billion, or 22 percent, driven by an increase in litigation-related charges, higher incentive compensation for market-based activities, and this segment allocation of the mutual fund settlement. Global Wealth and Investment Management Total Revenue increased $1.9 billion, or 47 percent, in 2004. Net Interest Income increased $915 million, or 47 percent, due to growth in Deposits, loan growth and the impact of FleetBoston earning assets to the portfolio. Noninterest Income increased $986 million, or 47 percent, driven by increased Investment and Brokerage Services revenue primarily due to the impact of FleetBoston. Net Income increased $366 million, or 30 percent. This increase was due to the increases in Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income offset by higher Noninterest Expense. Noninterest Expense increased $1.3 billion, or 64 percent, related to the impact of FleetBoston and this segment allocation of the mutual fund settlement. All Other In 2004 compared to 2003, Total Revenue decreased $339 million, or 53 percent. Net Interest Income decreased $352 million to negative $695 million primarily due to a reduction of capital in Other as more capital was deployed to the business segments. Offsetting this decrease was a $166 million increase in total revenue associated with the change in the fair value derivatives used as economic hedges of interest and foreign exchange rate fluctuations that do not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting. Provision for Credit Losses increased $43 million, or 14 percent. Gains on Sales of Debt Securities increased $675 million to $1.6 billion in 2004 as we continued to reposition the ALM portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and to manage mortgage prepayment risk. Other Noninterest Expense decreased $78 million and included Merger and Restructuring Charges of $618 million in 2004. As a result, Net Income improved $232 million. Total Revenue in Equity Investments increased $704 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to an improvement in Equity Investment Gains (Losses). Equity Investments had Net Income of $202 million in 2004 compared to a Net Loss of $246 million in 2003. In 2004, Principal Investing revenue increased as a result of increased realized gains compared to the prior year. Noninterest Income primarily consists of Equity Investment Gains. 79 Table of Contents Table I Average Balances and Interest Rates FTE Basis 2005 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) (Dollars in millions) Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Earning assets Time deposits placed and other short-term investments $ 14,286 $ 472 3.30 % $ 14,254 $ 362 2.54 % $ 9,056 $ 172 1.90 % Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 169,132 5,012 2.96 128,981 1,940 1.50 78,857 1,266 1.61 Trading account assets 133,502 5,883 4.41 104,616 4,092 3.91 97,222 4,005 4.12 Securities 219,843 11,047 5.03 150,171 7,320 4.88 70,644 3,135 4.44 Loans and leases (1) : Residential mortgage 173,773 9,424 5.42 167,270 9,056 5.42 127,131 6,873 5.41 Credit card 53,997 6,253 11.58 43,435 4,653 10.71 28,210 2,886 10.23 Home equity lines 56,289 3,412 6.06 39,400 1,835 4.66 22,890 1,040 4.55 Direct/Indirect consumer 44,981 2,589 5.75 38,078 2,093 5.50 32,593 1,964 6.03 Other consumer (2) 6,908 667 9.67 7,717 594 7.70 8,865 588 6.63 Total consumer 335,948 22,345 6.65 295,900 18,231 6.16 219,689 13,351 6.08 Commercial domestic 128,034 8,266 6.46 114,644 6,978 6.09 93,458 6,441 6.89 Commercial real estate 34,304 2,046 5.97 28,085 1,263 4.50 20,042 862 4.30 Commercial lease financing 20,441 992 4.85 17,483 819 4.68 10,061 395 3.92 Commercial foreign 18,491 1,292 6.99 16,505 850 5.15 12,970 460 3.55 Total commercial 201,270 12,596 6.26 176,717 9,910 5.61 136,531 8,158 5.98 Total loans and leases 537,218 34,941 6.50 472,617 28,141 5.95 356,220 21,509 6.04 Other earning assets 38,013 2,103 5.53 34,634 1,815 5.24 37,599 1,729 4.60 Total earning assets (3) 1,111,994 59,458 5.35 905,273 43,670 4.82 649,598 31,816 4.90 Cash and cash equivalents 33,199 28,511 22,637 Other assets, less allowance for loan and lease losses 124,699 110,847 76,869 Total assets $ 1,269,892 $ 1,044,631 $ 749,104 Interest-bearing liabilities Domestic interest-bearing deposits: Savings $ 36,602 $ 211 0.58 % $ 33,959 $ 119 0.35 % $ 24,538 $ 108 0.44 % NOW and money market deposit accounts 227,722 2,839 1.25 214,542 1,921 0.90 148,896 1,236 0.83 Consumer CDs and IRAs 124,385 4,091 3.29 94,770 2,540 2.68 70,246 2,556 3.64 Negotiable CDs, public funds and other time deposits 6,865 250 3.65 5,977 290 4.85 7,627 130 1.70 Total domestic interest-bearing deposits 395,574 7,391 1.87 349,248 4,870 1.39 251,307 4,030 1.60 Foreign interest-bearing deposits (4) : Banks located in foreign countries 22,945 1,202 5.24 18,426 679 3.68 13,959 285 2.04 Governments and official institutions 7,418 238 3.21 5,327 97 1.82 2,218 31 1.40 Time, savings and other 31,603 661 2.09 27,739 275 0.99 19,027 216 1.14 Total foreign interest-bearing deposits 61,966 2,101 3.39 51,492 1,051 2.04 35,204 532 1.51 Total interest-bearing deposits 457,540 9,492 2.08 400,740 5,921 1.48 286,511 4,562 1.59 Federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings 326,408 11,615 3.56 227,565 4,072 1.79 140,458 1,871 1.33 Trading account liabilities 57,689 2,364 4.10 35,326 1,317 3.73 37,176 1,286 3.46 Long-term debt 97,709 4,418 4.52 92,303 3,683 3.99 67,077 2,948 4.40 Total interest-bearing liabilities (3) 939,346 27,889 2.97 755,934 14,993 1.98 531,222 10,667 2.01 Noninterest-bearing sources: Noninterest-bearing deposits 174,892 150,819 119,722 Other liabilities 55,793 53,063 48,069 Shareholders equity 99,861 84,815 50,091 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 1,269,892 $ 1,044,631 $ 749,104 Net interest spread 2.38 2.84 2.89 Impact of noninterest-bearing sources 0.46 0.33 0.37 Net interest income/yield on earning assets $ 31,569 2.84 % $ 28,677 3.17 % $ 21,149 3.26 % (1) Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances.
