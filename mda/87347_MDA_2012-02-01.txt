Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report. Executive Overview After the strong recovery of 2010, when worldwide oil demand grew 2.7 million barrels per day to 88.3 million barrels per day corresponding to the largest year-on-year increase in 30 years, oil demand grew only by a modest 0.7 million barrels per day in 2011. This resulted from the combination of economic concerns in the OECD countries and lower growth in the emerging economies. On the supply side, the unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, and more specifically the shutdown of Libyan production from early in the first quarter through the end of the third quarter, significantly tightened worldwide production capacity thereby limiting OPEC spare capacity to its lowest level since 2008. Non-OPEC production remained essentially flat year-on-year, as the steady increase in North American liquids production was offset by the declining output of mature basins. Tight supply maintained sufficient pressure on oil prices to offset sluggish demand growth, and yearly average prices set new records. Natural gas markets behaved differently between the three major geographic areas of consumption. In North America, a continuous increase in unconventional gas production, modest demand growth, and mild weather at the beginning of the winter season contributed to maintain storage at or above five-year highs and keep natural gas prices low. In Asia, the need for alternative energy sources following the Fukushima incident, along with the fast growing demand in non-OECD economies maintained gas prices high and led to a significant increase in the demand for liquified natural gas. In Europe, despite decreasing demand, prices continued to be supported by the influence of Asian demand on common suppliers prices and by declining production in the North Sea. In this environment, Schlumberger Oilfield Services revenue reached a historical high in 2011 of $37 billion an increase of 39% over 2010. While this reflected a full year of revenue from the acquisitions of Smith International in August 2010 and Geoservices in April the same year, overall business conditions worldwide also improved during the year. In North America, which grew by 82% compared to 2010, this was seen through increased activity, stronger pricing and improved asset utilization as the market continued to shift to the liquids-rich plays that demanded higher service intensity in drilling and completing horizontal wells. A gradual return to activity in the deepwater US Gulf of Mexico, which accelerated as the year progressed also contributed to North American results. International growth of 24% was marked by strengthening activity in deepwater areas and active exploration basins as well as by signs of pricing traction for certain Technologies. In the Latin America Area, where revenue grew by 29%, drilling and production activity increased. Europe, CIS and Africa grew by 22% in revenue terms with strength in the North Sea and Russia but suffered the most in terms of the geopolitical unrest that affected North Africa and the Middle East with Libya shut down from late-February until operations recommenced in October. Revenue in the Middle East & Asia Area increased by 21% driven by improving activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia although these improvements were slowed by geopolitical unrest. All three Product Groups saw improved activity. The most substantial gain (73%) was recorded by the Drilling Group due largely to the full year revenue from the acquisitions of Smith International and Geoservices. However, this was underpinned by growth across almost all Drilling Group Technologies driven by overall activity and pricing gains during the year for Drilling & Measurements services. The ramp-up in Integrated Project Management (IPM) well construction projects in Iraq also contributed to the growth. Reservoir Production services and products grew by 41% led by Well Services in North America through higher pricing, capacity additions and improved asset utilization and efficiency as the market transitioned to liquid-rich plays. Reservoir Characterization grew by 7%, led by Wireline on activity mix and WesternGeco on higher multiclient seismic sales. Market penetration of new technologies in a number of areas also contributed to the year performance. In Reservoir Characterization services, the growing wave of exploration projects increased demand for the Wireline Scanner Family* measurements that provide more complete understanding of difficult and complex formations. In many cases, complementary technologies deployed included InSitu Fluid Analyzer* and Quicksilver Probe* formation fluid testing and sampling services while other advanced Wireline technologies were used in the evaluation of unconventional reservoirs. WesternGeco benefited from this trend with new contracts for Coil Shooting* and Dual Coil Shooting* full-azimuth seismic acquisition surveys, a type of survey unique to Schlumberger. 15 Table of Contents Further integration of Schlumberger and Smith drilling-focused technologies boosted Drilling Group results. In particular, the growing use of Smith IDEAS* modeling software enabled optimal selection of bottomhole assembly components, particularly in matching drillbits to rotary steerable systems. Among individual product lines, Smith drillbit technologies benefited from the larger Schlumberger geographical footprint, while Drilling & Measurements Scope Family* logging-while-drilling services played significant roles in enhancing performance in a number of complex, high-profile wells. In particular, China and Russia saw increasing penetration of Schlumberger Drilling Group technologies. Demand for reservoir production technologies was boosted by growing deployment of the HiWAY* channel fracturing service in unconventional and tight reservoir applications around the world. By midyear, HiWAY technology had been introduced across all four geographical Areas, with more than 1,200 stages pumped. The HiWAY service is part of the Schlumberger approach that achieves more performance with less equipment and resources and this number of stages alone saved over 60,000 tons of proppant compared to conventional operations. In the fourth quarter, stages pumped grew by 50% sequentially and operations were conducted for 35 customers. A number of small technology-based acquisitions were completed during 2011 in addition to completion of the Eurasia Drilling Company Ltd asset swap and strategic alliance announced in 2010. These included the purchase of the remaining equity interest in Framo Engineering AS, a privately owned Norwegian company specializing in the sales and manufacture of products and services related to multiphase pumps and subsea pump systems, multiphase metering systems and swivel and marine systems. Schlumberger also completed the purchase of ThruBit LLC, a company providing openhole logging services using a unique through-the-bit deployment technique that offers a novel way of obtaining wireline logs in horizontal wells in shale plays. In IPM, Schlumberger and Saxon Energy Services merged their respective land-based rig fleets resulting in Schlumberger rigs and crews operating in Oman, Pakistan and Venezuela becoming part of Saxon operations. Under the terms of the agreement, Saxon will also provide technical drilling contracting support to existing Schlumberger joint ventures in Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iraq and Venezuela, ensuring availability and support to Schlumberger well construction activities. As part of a stronger focus on the growing production services enhancement market, Schlumberger Production Management was formed during the year to increase market participation and became responsible for the Casabe and Bokor projects that were previously managed by IPM. For 2012, projected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth continued to be revised downwards during the fourth quarter, and positive signs from the US and Japan are offset by continued concerns over the Eurozone and the potential slowing of growth in China. In spite of the political efforts to resolve the issues, the uncertainty surrounding the global financial markets is expected to continue in the coming quarters, and although the chance of a global double-dip recession remains a possibility, this is not expected to be the most likely scenario. In line with lower GDP growth, oil demand outlook has also been revised downwards during the fourth quarter although the increasing weight of the emerging economies, the weakness of non-OPEC supply, and a number of geopolitical concerns have supported oil prices. Absent a global recession, these are not expected to weaken significantly. For natural gas worldwide, little change is expected in the behavior of the main geographical markets in 2012 compared to 2011. Feedback from Schlumberger customers and the findings from recently published spending surveys suggest that exploration and production investment in 2012 will be higher than that of 2011, although the predicted levels vary. The same surveys suggest that exploration spending will continue to increase. Against this backdrop Schlumberger is planning for growth in 2012, although with significant flexibility. In North America, land rig count is expected to remain flat with 2011 fourth-quarter levels, provided the ongoing drop in gas rig activity will be countered by increasing activity in liquids and liquids-rich basins. A continued recovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is also expected, with strong demand for high-value technologies. In international markets, rig count in 2012 is expected to increase by around 10% versus 2011, driven by strong offshore activity in West Africa, North Sea and Brazil, and by land activity in the Middle East, North Africa and Western Siberia. Overall Schlumberger remains confident that any potential reductions in activity will be short-lived due to limited spare oil capacity and to growing international demand for natural gas. Further, the company believes its competitive position remains strong given its strength in the international market in terms of global footprint and contract portfolio, and given the balance that has been established between reservoir characterization, drilling and production services in North America. The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements . 16 Table of Contents Fourth Quarter 2011 Results Products Groups (Stated in millions) Fourth Quarter 2011 Third Quarter 2011 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services Reservoir Characterization $ 2,787 $ 777 $ 2,488 $ 610 Drilling 3,909 658 3,676 613 Reservoir Production 3,598 768 3,373 707 Eliminations & other 8 (34 ) 9 1 10,302 2,169 9,546 1,931 Distribution 685 26 698 31 Eliminations (13 ) (15 ) 672 26 683 31 Corporate & other (1) (154 ) (158 ) Interest income (2) 8 9 Interest expense (3) (81 ) (69 ) Charges & credits (4) (82 ) (27 ) $ 10,974 $ 1,886 $ 10,229 $ 1,717 Geographic Areas (Stated in millions) Fourth Quarter 2011 Third Quarter 2011 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services North America $ 3,516 $ 947 $ 3,304 $ 836 Latin America 1,834 302 1,655 270 Europe/CIS/Africa 2,704 476 2,494 408 Middle East & Asia 2,136 500 2,003 444 Eliminations & other 112 (56 ) 90 (27 ) 10,302 2,169 9,546 1,931 Distribution 685 26 698 31 Eliminations (13 ) (15 ) 672 26 683 31 Corporate & other (1) (154 ) (158 ) Interest income (2) 8 9 Interest expense (3) (81 ) (69 ) Charges & credits (4) (82 ) (27 ) $ 10,974 $ 1,886 $ 10,229 $ 1,717 (1) Comprised principally of corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, interest on postretirement medical benefits, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of Smith and certain other nonoperating items.

(3) Excludes interest expense included in the segments income (fourth quarter 2011 $5 million; third quarter 2011 $1 million). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Oilfield Services Fourth-quarter revenue of $10.30 billion increased 8% sequentially with increases across all Groups and geographical Areas. 17 Table of Contents Sequentially, Reservoir Characterization revenue increased on strong WesternGeco multiclient sales in the US Gulf of Mexico and the Angola GeoMarket, together with robust end-of-year Schlumberger Information Solutions (SIS) software sales across all Areas. WesternGeco also improved with the resumption of land seismic activity in the Middle East and new surveys in North Africa. Wireline reported considerable growth across all geographical Areas, and particularly on stronger offshore exploration activities in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea, Southern & Eastern Africa and Central & West Africa GeoMarkets. Drilling revenue increased on higher M-I SWACO activity in North America Land, the US Gulf of Mexico and Latin America. IPM revenue increased significantly, mostly from projects in Mexico and Iraq, while Drilling & Measurements revenue was higher on improved pricing and strong activity in the US Gulf of Mexico and the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket. Reservoir Production revenue increased, driven by stronger Completions and Artificial Lift product sales across all Areas. In North America Land, Well Services grew through capacity additions and continued improvements in asset utilization and crew efficiency. In addition, Framo and Schlumberger Production Management (SPM) posted strong sequential increases. On a geographical basis, North America Area revenue grew sequentially on increasing deepwater work in the US Gulf of Mexico, higher rig count and land activity in the US and Canada, and significant WesternGeco multiclient sales. In addition, Well Services reported considerable increases from additional fleet deployment and continued improvements in asset utilization and crew efficiency. In the Latin America Area, strong revenue was recorded in the Mexico & Central America GeoMarket from higher IPM project activities and SIS software sales; in the Venezuela, Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket from WesternGeco marine seismic activities; and in the Peru, Colombia & Ecuador GeoMarket from robust Artificial Lift product sales. In the Europe/CIS/Africa Area, strong results were led by the Angola GeoMarket, which saw vigorous WesternGeco multiclient sales in addition to expanded presalt offshore activity for Wireline, Testing Services & Drilling & Measurements; the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket, which recorded robust Completions product sales and higher Drilling & Measurements and Wireline activity; and the North Africa GeoMarket that reported higher Wireline, Testing Services, Well Services and IPM project activity. These increases, however, were reduced by lower North Sea activity which was impacted by seasonal weather issues. In the Middle East & Asia Area, strong Completions and Artificial Lift product sales and robust SIS software sales drove results particularly in the India GeoMarket. These results were augmented by continued growth in the Saudi Arabia, Bahrain GeoMarket due to the rebound of land seismic acquisition, strong rigless activity and land rig additions. The Oman GeoMarket grew primarily on higher Wireline and Artificial Lift activities while the Iraq GeoMarket saw an increase in non-project services in addition to new IPM projects. Pretax operating income of $2.17 billion increased 12% sequentially over prior quarter. Pretax operating margin increased 82 basis points (bps) sequentially to 21.1% primarily due to the strong sales of WesternGeco multiclient licenses, SIS software and Completions products. Drilling & Measurements and Wireline also contributed to this sequential improvement through increasing higher-margin exploration activities. Reservoir Characterization Fourth-quarter revenue of $2.79 billion was 12% higher sequentially. Pretax operating income of $777 million was 28% higher compared to the third quarter of 2011. WesternGeco and SIS posted significant sequential revenue growth on strong multiclient sales in the US Gulf of Mexico and the Angola GeoMarket, and on robust software sales across all geographical Areas, respectively. WesternGeco also improved on the resumption of land seismic activity in the Middle East and new surveys in North Africa. Wireline recorded increases across all Areas led by stronger offshore exploration activities in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea, Southern & Eastern Africa and Central & West Africa GeoMarkets. Data & Consulting Services and Testing Services also posted gains. Sequentially, pretax operating margins increased markedly by 340 bps to 27.9% through the seasonally strong sales of WesternGeco multiclient licenses and SIS software. Increasing higher-margin Wireline exploration activities also contributed to the growth. 18 Table of Contents Drilling Fourth-quarter revenue of $3.91 billion was 6% higher sequentially. Pretax operating income of $658 million improved 7% sequentially. Significant sequential revenue growth was recorded by M-I SWACO from higher rig count on land in the US & Canada; sustained growth in deepwater activity in the US Gulf of Mexico; and strong contributions in Latin America. IPM activity increased significantly, mainly from projects in Mexico and in Iraq. Drilling & Measurements revenue increased on improved pricing and strong activity in the US Gulf of Mexico and the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket, although this was partially offset by weather-related activity reductions in the North Sea and East Asia GeoMarkets. In addition, Geoservices and Bits & Advanced Technologies registered robust sequential increases. Sequentially, pretax operating margins were up slightly to 16.8%. Drilling & Measurements obtained increased margins from improved technology mix and service pricing but this was partly offset by the effects of weather-related activity delays and reductions. Most of the other Technologies exacted margin expansion following the continued successful integration and expansion of Smith, Geoservices and Schlumberger drilling technologies. Reservoir Production Fourth-quarter revenue of $3.60 billion increased 7% over the prior quarter. Pretax operating income of $768 million was 9% higher sequentially. Among Reservoir Production Group Technologies, Completions and Artificial Lift posted the strongest sequential growth driven by robust product sales across all Areas. Well Services sequential growth was seen mainly in North America Land as additional fleets deployed and continued improvements in asset utilization and crew efficiency were achieved although these positive factors were partially muted by the impact of year-end seasonal effects. Framo and SPM also posted strong sequential increases. Sequentially, fourth-quarter pretax operating margins were slightly up at 21.3%. Completions, Artificial Lift and Well Services reported improvements from strong sales.

(2) Excludes interest income included in the segments income (2011 $3 million; 2010 $7 million). (3) Excludes interest expense included in the segments income (2011 $8 million; 2010 $5 million). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Oilfield Services Full-year 2011 revenue of $37.0 billion was 39% higher than 2010 primarily reflecting the acquisition of Smith on August 27, 2010 as well as the significantly improved activity, pricing and asset efficiency for Well Services Technologies in North America as the market transitioned to liquid-rich plays demanding increasing service intensity in drilling and completing horizontal wells. Year-on-year pretax operating margin increased 75 bps to 19.8% largely due to the improved pricing and asset efficiency for Well Services Technologies in North America and the resumption of higher-margin activity in the US Gulf of Mexico. However, the margin expansion was tempered by activity disruptions from the geopolitical unrest in North Africa and in the Middle East during the first quarter of 2011. Reservoir Characterization Revenue of $9.93 billion was 7% higher than the same period last year on stronger Wireline activity, higher WesternGeco marine and multiclient sales, and increased SIS software sales. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 23 bps to 24.7% led by margin declines in Wireline and Testing Services, largely due to the revenue mix, as well as the impact of geopolitical events which prevailed during the first quarter of 2011. The margin decline however was partially offset by a favorable WesternGeco multiclient sales mix and improved marine vessel utilization. Drilling Revenue of $14.25 billion was 73% higher than the same period last year reflecting the acquisitions of Smith, in August 2010, and Geoservices, in April 2010, partially offset by a decrease in IPM activities in Mexico. The ramp-up of IPM projects in Iraq also contributed to the revenue increase. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 24 bps to 16.0% largely due to the addition of the Smith and Geoservices activities as well as the effects of the geopolitical events. 20 Table of Contents Reservoir Production Revenue of $12.75 billion was 41% higher than the same period last year while pretax operating margin increased 541 bps to 20.5%. Well Services revenue and margins expanded strongly in North America on higher pricing, capacity additions and improved asset utilization and efficiency as the market transitioned to liquid-rich plays. Internationally, Well Services also posted growth on the strength of higher activity, despite the exceptional geopolitical events which prevailed during the first quarter of 2011. Distribution Revenue of $2.62 billion increased $1.85 billion, while pretax operating income of $103 million increased $74 million compared to last year. These increases are attributable to the fact that 2010 reflected only four months of activity following the Smith acquisition. Full-Year 2010 Results (Stated in millions) 2010 2009 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services Reservoir Characterization $ 9,321 $ 2,321 $ 9,502 $ 2,559 Drilling 8,230 1,334 5,881 1,245 Reservoir Production 9,053 1,368 7,282 780 Eliminations & other 69 48 37 51 26,673 5,071 22,702 4,635 Distribution 774 29 774 29 Corporate & other (1) (406 ) (327 ) Interest income (2) 43 52 Interest expense (3) (202 ) (188 ) Charges & credits (4) 621 (238 ) $ 27,447 $ 5,156 $ 22,702 $ 3,934 (Stated in millions) 2010 2009 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services North America $ 6,729 $ 1,145 $ 4,217 $ 387 Latin America 4,985 808 4,552 864 Europe/CIS/Africa 8,024 1,457 7,737 1,821 Middle East & Asia 6,650 1,764 5,961 1,817 Eliminations & other 285 (103 ) 235 (254 ) 26,673 5,071 22,702 4,635 Distribution 774 29 774 29 Corporate & other (1) (406 ) (327 ) Interest income (2) 43 52 Interest expense (3) (202 ) (188 ) Charges & credits (4) 621 (238 ) $ 27,447 $ 5,156 $ 22,702 $ 3,934 (1) Comprised principally of corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, interest on postretirement medical benefits, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of Smith and certain other nonoperating items.

(4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 21 Table of Contents Oilfield Services Full-year 2010 revenue of $26.67 billion was 17% higher than 2009. This increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of Smith as well as significantly higher activity and pricing for Well Services technologies in US land. However, these increases were partially offset by lower activity in the US Gulf of Mexico due to the deepwater drilling moratorium and by lower pricing and activity in Europe/CIS/Africa. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin declined 141 bps to 19.0% primarily due to the inclusion of the acquired Smith businesses as well as the reduced activity and weaker pricing in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area. These effects, however, were partially offset by the impact of the stronger activity and pricing for Well Services technologies in US land. Reservoir Characterization Revenue of $9.32 billion was 2% lower than last year. WesternGeco revenue decreased primarily due to reduced activity and pricing for Marine acquisition services, which was partially offset by higher sales of wide-azimuth multiclient surveys in the US Gulf of Mexico. Wireline revenue fell primarily due to the deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced activity and lower pricing in Europe/CIS/Africa. Testing Services revenue also decreased as a result of lower activity and pricing in Europe/CIS/Africa. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in SIS revenue primarily in Latin America and North America. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 203 bps to 24.9% mostly due to the lower activity and pricing for Wireline and Testing services in Europe/CIS/Africa and from the impact of the moratorium in the US Gulf of Mexico. Drilling Revenue of $8.23 billion was 40% higher than the previous year. This increase was primarily driven from the acquisitions of Smith and Geoservices during 2010 partially offset by lower revenue for Drilling & Measurements due to the impact of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the US Gulf of Mexico and generally lower pricing in international markets. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 496 bps to 16.2% due to the inclusion of the Smith and Geoservices technologies as well the lower pricing and activity for Drilling & Measurements. Reservoir Production Revenue of $9.05 billion was 24% higher year-on-year mostly from significantly higher pricing and activity for Well Services technologies in North America and increased gain share from SPM field production projects in Latin America. In addition, an $87 million early payout relating to services on an SPM gain share project, triggered by the customer sale of the field, also contributed to the revenue growth. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 440 bps to 15.1% primarily due to improved pricing and activity for Well Services in North America and strong contribution from the SPM field production projects. The SPM gain share early payout mentioned above contributed approximately $55 million to pretax operating income. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 40 $ 50 $ 61 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies: M-I SWACO 78 131 Others 89 86 78 Other 3 $ 129 $ 214 $ 273 22 Table of Contents Equity in Net Earnings of Affiliated Companies Equity income from the M-I SWACO joint venture in 2010 represents eight months of equity income through the closing of the Smith transaction. Interest Expense Interest expense of $298 million in 2011 increased by $91 million compared to 2010 primarily due to the $4.6 billion of long-term debt that Schlumberger issued during 2011. Interest expense of $207 million in 2010 decreased by $14 million compared to 2009 primarily due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates, from 3.9% to 3.2%. Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue , were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Research & engineering 2.7 % 3.3 % 3.5 % General & administrative 1.1 % 1.1 % 1.1 % Although Research & engineering decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 as compared to 2010 and in 2010 compared to 2009, it has increased in absolute dollars by $154 million and $117 million, respectively. These increases in absolute dollars were driven in large part by the impact of the Smith acquisition. Income Taxes The Schlumberger effective tax rate was 24.4% in 2011, 17.3% in 2010, and 19.6% in 2009. The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase. The effective tax rate for both 2011 and 2010 was impacted by the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Excluding the impact of these charges and credits, the effective tax rate in 2011 was 24.0% compared to 20.6% in 2010. This increase in the effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the charges and credits, was primarily attributable to the fact that Schlumberger generated a larger proportion of its pretax earnings in North America in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of improved market conditions and the effect of a full year activity from the acquired Smith businesses. The effective tax rate for 2009 was also impacted by the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , but to a much lesser extent. Excluding charges and credits, the effective tax rate in 2010 was 20.6% compared to 19.2% in 2009. This increase is largely attributable to the geographic mix of earnings as well as the inclusion of four months results from the acquisition of Smith, which served to increase the Schlumberger effective tax rate. Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2011, 2010 and 2009.

During the second quarter of 2010, Schlumberger completed the acquisition of Geoservices for cash of $0.9 billion. Schlumberger assumed net debt of $0.1 billion in connection with this transaction. 25 Table of Contents During the third and fourth quarters of 2010, Schlumberger repurchased the following debt: (Stated in millions) Carrying Value 6.50% Notes due 2012 $ 649 6.75% Senior Notes due 2011 224 9.75% Senior Notes due 2019 212 6.00% Senior Notes due 2016 102 8.625% Senior Notes due 2014 88 $ 1,275 The premium paid in excess of the carrying value to repurchase the $1.275 billion of debt was approximately $67 million. Schlumberger maintains a 3.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note program. This program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in Euro, US dollar or other currencies. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Schlumberger issued 1.0 billion 2.75% Guaranteed Notes due under this program. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 2.56%. During the first quarter of 2009, Schlumberger issued 1.0 billion 4.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2014 under this program. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.95%. During the third quarter of 2009, Schlumberger issued $450 million of 3.00% Guaranteed Notes due 2013. On April 17, 2008, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock, to be acquired in the open market before December 31, 2011. On July 21, 2011, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved an extension of this repurchase program to December 31, 2013. Schlumberger had repurchased $6.15 billion of shares under this program as of December 31, 2011. The following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2011, 2010 and 2009: (Stated in thousands except per share amounts) Total cost of shares purchased Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share 2011 $ 2,997,688 36,940.4 $ 81.15 2010 $ 1,716,675 26,624.8 $ 64.48 2009 $ 500,097 7,825.0 $ 63.91 Cash flow provided by operations was $6.2 billion in 2011, $5.5 billion in 2010 and $5.3 billion in 2009. At times in recent periods, Schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from certain of its customers. Schlumberger operates in approximately 85 countries. At December 31, 2011, only four of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger accounts receivable balance of which only one, the United States, represented greater than 10%. Dividends paid during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $1.30 billion, $1.04 billion and $1.01 billion, respectively. On January 19, 2012, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 10%, to $0.275. On January 21, 2011, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 19%, to $0.25. 26 Table of Contents Capital expenditures were $4.0 billion in 2011, $2.9 billion in 2010 and $2.4 billion in 2009. Capital expenditures are expected to approach $4.5 billion for the full year 2012. During 2011, 2010 and 2009 Schlumberger made contributions of $601 million, $868 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, to its postretirement benefit plans. The US pension plans were 87% funded at December 31, 2011 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 95% funded at December 31, 2010. Schlumberger international defined benefit pension plans are a combined 88% funded at December 31, 2011 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 92% funded at December 31, 2010. Schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately $600 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2012, subject to market and business conditions. There were $321 million outstanding Series B debentures at December 31, 2009. During 2010, the remaining $320 million of the 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 were converted by holders into 8.0 million shares of Schlumberger common stock and the remaining $1 million of outstanding Series B debentures were redeemed for cash. As of December 31, 2011, Schlumberger had approximately $4.8 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $4.1 billion with commercial banks, of which $2.8 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2011. This included $3.5 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in the United States and Europe. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Schlumberger had $0.9 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2011.

(2) Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust its requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 18 Pension and Other Benefit Plans of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As discussed in Note 14 Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in the Schlumberger Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011 is approximately $1.35 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. 27 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumberger significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data The WesternGeco business capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $425 million and $394 million, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value. The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. Certain larger surveys, which are typically prefunded by customers, are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill. The goodwill relating to each of Schlumberger reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, Schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if Schlumberger concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of a two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 28 Table of Contents Schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill, Schlumberger four reporting units are the three Groups comprising Oilfield Services: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Reservoir Production, as well as the Distribution business segment. Schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on this assessment, Schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further testing was required. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period. Income Taxes Schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was 5.00% at December 31, 2011 and 5.50% at December 31, 2010. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger international pension plans was 4.95% at December 31, 2011 and 5.47% at December 31, 2010. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans decreased from 6.00% in 2010 to 5.50% in 2011. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger international pension plans decreased from 5.89% in 2010 to 5.47% in 2011. 29 Table of Contents A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense. The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 7.50% in 2011 and 8.50% in 2010. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was 7.50% in 2011 and 8.00% in 2010. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both the 2011 postretirement medical expense as well as the postretirement medical liability as of December 31, 2011 was 8% graded to 5% over the next six years. The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States and international pension plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2011 Pretax Pension Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2011 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$32 +$299 25 basis point increase in discount rate -$28 - $283 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$15 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets -$15 The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2011 Pretax Postretirement Medical Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2011 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate + $4 + $44 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $4 - $41 100 basis point decrease per annum in medical cost trend rate - $24 - $160 100 basis point increase per annum in medical cost trend rate + $28 + $196 30 Table of Contents
