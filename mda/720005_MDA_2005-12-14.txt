ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following Management Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Management Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company financial statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements. The Company results continue to be highly correlated to the direction of the equity markets and are subject to volatility due to changes in interest rates, valuation of financial instruments, economic and political trends and industry competition. An environment favorable to the Company success is characterized by a stable political environment, low inflation, low unemployment, upward-trending financial markets, and strong business profitability which lead to investor confidence. During 2005, long term inflation expectations remained low and the Federal Reserve continued its measured and consecutive short-term interest rate increases. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and NASDAQ indices rose 5%, 11% and 14%, respectively, during the fiscal year. The average monthly volume of shares traded increased 16% over the prior year on both the NYSE and NASDAQ. Corporate earnings have also been generally much stronger than expected, with earnings growth generally in double digits over the prior year. These factors had a positive impact on the levels of equity underwritings and merger and acquisition activity leading to strong results in the Capital Markets Segment. The impact of higher trading volumes and improved investor confidence is reflected in the increase in both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets securities commissions. 16 Results of Operations - Total Company The Company currently operates through the following seven business segments: Private Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow and various corporate investments and expenses combined in the "Other" segment. T he Other segment previously consisted of what is now three segments: Emerging Markets, Stock Loan/Borrow, and Other. Reclassifications have been made in the segment disclosures for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 to conform to the current year presentation. The following table presents consolidated and segment financial information for the Company for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, September 24, September 26, 2005 2004 2003 (in 000's) Total Company Revenues $ 2,156,997 $ 1,829,776 $ 1,497,571 Pretax earnings 247,971 204,121 138,275 Private Client Group Revenues 1,397,578 1,202,368 975,666 Pretax earnings 102,245 107,122 69,926 Capital Markets Revenues 455,151 400,787 330,966 Pretax earnings 77,333 57,910 37,532 Asset Management Revenues 171,916 148,160 123,647 Pretax earnings 40,841 27,875 18,730 RJBank Revenues 45,448 28,104 28,699 Pretax earnings 14,204 8,824 10,182 Emerging Markets Revenues 38,768 27,675 25,576 Pretax earnings 5,927 4,304 992 Stock Loan/Stock Borrow Revenues 31,876 16,372 11,970 Pretax earnings 5,962 2,135 1,484 Other Revenues 16,260 6,310 1,047 Pretax earnings (loss) 1,459 (4,049) (571) 17 Year ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 24, 2004 - Total Company The Company had record results for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, with both total and net revenues surpassing $2 billion for the first time in the Company history. Net income of over $150 million was up 18% from the prior year. Driven by robust increases in investment banking revenues (41%) and net interest earnings (48% - see table below) combined with solid increases in investment advisory fees (17%) and securities commissions and fees (10%), all three of the Company largest segments had significantly higher revenues than in the prior year. Capital Markets and Asset Management had even more impressive increases in pretax profits (34% and 47%, respectively). Private Client Group earnings were negatively impacted by legal expenses and settlements. Total firm net revenues increased 14%, while pre-tax, pre-minority interest profits were up 19% over the prior year. Pre-tax profits after consideration of minority interest were up 21% over the prior year. Year ended September 24, 2004 Compared with the Year ended September 26, 2003 - Total Company Total revenues increased 22% to a record $1.83 billion, as each of the Company three largest segments contributed to the growth. Net revenues rose 23%, as interest expense grew only 6%. Scattered throughout several segments, net interest earnings continue to be an important source of profits to the Company (see the table below). Significantly, the upward trend of the equity markets during most of fiscal 2004 led many individual investors to return to the market, which in turn led to a steady rise in margin debits throughout the year. These balances are the Company best interest spread product, as the risk is well controlled and they are funded by relatively low cost client funds awaiting investment. Margin loan growth is largely responsible for the overall 5% improvement in net interest income. 18 Net Interest Analysis Year Ended September 30, 2005 September 24, 2004 September 26, 2003 ($ in 000's) Interest Revenue Margin balances: Average balance $ 1,218,486 $ 1,006,007 $ 887,376 Average rate 5.6% 4.0% 4.1% Interest revenue - margin balances 68,125 39,750 36,614 Assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations: Average balance 2,390,174 2,288,593 2,244,959 Average rate 2.8% 1.1% 1.2% Interest revenue - segregated assets 65,847 24,832 27,164 Stock borrowed: Average balance 1,129,560 1,291,636 908,275 Average rate 2.4% 1.1% 1.2% Interest revenue - stock borrowed 27,025 14,625 10,531 Raymond James Bank, FSB interest income 45,017 27,318 26,743 Other interest revenue 39,548 28,239 26,655 Total interest revenue $ 245,562 $ 134,764 $ 127,707 Interest Expense Client interest program: Average balance $ 3,228,443 $ 2,715,667 $2,667,517 Average rate 1.8% 0.4% 0.6% Interest expense - client interest program 58,486 11,659 15,685 Stock loaned: Average balance 1,209,181 1,387,818 954,394 Average rate 1.9% 0.9% 0.9% Interest expense - stock loaned 22,440 12,405 8,817 Raymond James Bank, FSB interest expense 22,020 9,863 10,469 Other interest expense 14,843 14,590 10,640 Total interest expense $ 117,789 $ 48,517 $ 45,611 Net interest income $ 127,773 $ 86,247 $ 82,096 19 The dramatic increase in net interest earnings was largely rate-driven augmented by a healthy 21% increase in average margin balances. The Federal Reserve raised short-term rates by 25 basis points eight times during fiscal 2005. Rising rates contribute to the Company's net interest earnings by increasing spreads earned on cash balances of brokerage clients, at Raymond James Bank, and in the securities lending operation. Further, higher rates were earned on the portion of the Company's capital that is invested in interest-bearing instruments.

Due to the continued process of upgrading the Company Financial Advisor population, which encompassed the termination of lower producers, the net increase in the number of Financial Advisors was only 2%. The Company branding campaign, which has increased the visibility of the firm name, and the promotion of the AdvisorChoice platform for Financial Advisors has helped to increase Financial Advisor interest in the Company. In particular, the employee firm (RJA) had strong recruiting results in the latter half of the year as the Company benefited from industry consolidation. Most of the increase in commission and fee revenue is attributable to the increased average production of Financial Advisors and was close to the Company's goal of a 10% increase per year. Further productivity gains may be expected, provided the market conditions remain favorable, as newly recruited Financial Advisors complete the transition of their accounts and existing Financial Advisors grow their businesses. While average margin balances increased 21% for the fiscal year, interest revenues within PCG increased 97% as a result of rising short-term interest rates, which also led to higher than normal spreads. Accordingly, PCG net interest earnings increased 37%, and represented nearly 80% of this segment's earnings. Commission expense grew ratably with commission and fee revenue. Increased administrative compensation costs include cost of living raises, a 6% increase in employee headcount and increased incentive compensation and benefit plan accruals related to increased corporate profitability. Communications and Information Processing expense increased as the Company continues its efforts to provide state of the art technology to its Financial Advisors. Business Development expense includes the marketing expenditures to promote the AdvisorChoice platform to prospective Financial Advisors and the Company's branding efforts - including a new television ad and increased air time. These efforts, combined with the stadium naming rights for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football stadium, have increased the Company name recognition nationwide. Business Development expense also includes increased travel expenses related to recruiting efforts and increased attendance at sales and education conferences. Other expense continues to be dominated by legal expenses and settlements. PCG margins, which were 7.6% in fiscal 2005, were negatively impacted by the losses in the early stage, independent contractor joint venture in the UK, relatively low margins in the private client group in RJ Ltd (as they grow their independent contractor division) and historically high legal costs and settlements, which has had an estimated 1.5% to 2% impact on PCG margins in each of the past two years. Year ended September 24, 2004 Compared with the Year ended September 26, 2003 - Private Client Group The 25% increase in PCG commission revenues was attributable to the combination of several factors. First, there was a modest net increase in Financial Advisor headcount of 118, or 2.5%, to 4,929 in the Company wholly-owned subsidiaries. More importantly, the process of upgrading the sales force by releasing lower producers continued in earnest. Thus, the overall composition of the sales force was improved from the prior year. Finally, there were 7 months of strong market activity during 2004 as compared to approximately six strong months in 2003. The aforementioned improved quality of the sales force amplified the effect on revenues of the longer duration of good market conditions. The improved interest spread was due to the steady rise in margin debits throughout the year. The increase in financial service fees was a result of the increased number of transaction fees from trades in fee-based accounts and a higher amount of IRA fees as the number of such accounts grew. Other revenues increased due to higher mutual fund networking fees and greater meeting sponsorship revenues. Administrative compensation costs reflect increased home office staffing in the domestic independent contractor subsidiary and higher incentive compensation accruals as profits were significantly improved. Business development expenses rose due primarily to the cost of promoting the AdvisorChoice platform. Most notably, other expenses, including legal expenses and reserves, declined by one third from the prior year. As is the case in all of the Company major businesses, there is significant operating leverage in the PCG, particularly with increases in Financial Advisor average production. Accordingly, the 24% increase in net revenues led to a surge in pretax income of 53%. 21 Results of Operations - Capital Markets The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Capital Markets segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

Although the number of managed/co-managed corporate underwritings was nearly flat, underwriting fees were up 47% as a result of an increased average deal size and a greater number of lead managed deals. Merger and acquisition fees nearly doubled from fiscal 2004. Equity Capital Markets has nine strategic business units; real estate, energy and healthcare were the strongest performers during fiscal 2005. These record investment banking results contribute significantly to the firm's profits, as incremental revenues produce a high margin. RJTCF revenues were up 30% and contributed $5 million to the segment's pretax profits. RJTCF syndicates real estate partnerships that qualify for federal and state low income housing tax credits. During fiscal 2005, RJTCF invested over $250 million for institutional investors in 93 real estate transactions compared to $206 million in 80 deals in fiscal 2004. Interest expense, the expense associated with carrying the fixed income trading inventory, was up due to increased interest rates. Non-interest expense was up 11% - with 83% of that increase related to compensation. The remaining expenses were relatively flat. 22 Year ended September 24, 2004 Compared with the Year ended September 26, 2003 - Capital Markets Despite a significant decline in fixed income sales volume, the unprecedented activity levels of the Equity Capital Markets operations propelled this segment to record revenues and profits. Most notably, the Company was lead or co-manager for 120 public offerings for the year, nearly double the number in 2003, as market conditions were conducive for several of the industries on which these efforts are focused. This deal flow was a major contributing factor to the increase in institutional equity sales commissions. The decline in fixed income commissions reflects investors hesitancy to commit funds while anticipating a rising interest rate environment. The rise in interest expense represents the financing costs of the higher average fixed income inventory balances. Commission expense was nearly flat despite the 15% rise in commission revenues as fixed income commissions carry a higher payout than equities. The increase in administrative expense is primarily attributable to higher profit-based incentive compensation in equity capital markets departments. The operating leverage in this segment was dramatic as the average production of institutional equity salesmen, sales traders and investment bankers rose sharply. As a result, record profits of $57.9 million were 54% higher than in the prior year.

Due to the billing schedules this increase does not correlate directly to the increase in average assets under management. Approximately one-half of the Company assets under management are billed based on beginning-of-quarter balances and slightly less than one-third are billed based on average daily balances. The remaining assets under management are predominantly billed based on end-of-quarter balances. The overall growth of managed equity programs was the aggregate result of strong net sales and market appreciation. Eagle Asset Management has several portfolio managers with strong performance records and the firm has been successful in winning a growing number of institutional accounts. Accordingly, assets managed for institutional accounts increased 34% over the prior year. Several of the same portfolio managers also manage portfolios for the Heritage Asset Management mutual fund family. Assets in these funds, excluding the money market funds, increased 28% over the prior year. In addition to Eagle portfolio managers, the asset management division of RJA offers 30 independent investment advisors to the Company's clients through its Raymond James Consulting Services program. Assets managed within this program have increased 37% over the prior year. The Company has also seen significant growth (153%) in its managed mutual fund product (Freedom) as this concept is extremely popular with Financial Advisors and clients. Expense growth in this segment was a modest 9%, primarily reflecting increased personnel costs related to profit-based incentive compensation and increased business development expenses related to increased travel and proposal costs. Other expense is predominantly fees paid to outside money managers. With the capacity to increase assets under management significantly in certain disciplines without significant additional costs, there is a higher degree of leverage in this segment and management has a positive outlook on its prospects, provided market conditions do not deteriorate and performance results remain strong. Year ended September 24, 2004 Compared with the Year ended September 26, 2003 - Asset Management Investment advisory fees rose at a rate higher than that of assets under management primarily because the increase in assets consisted entirely of equity accounts, which bear a higher management fee than fixed income and money market assets. In addition, the Company earned approximately $930,000 more in performance fees from managed hedge funds than in the prior year. Money market fund balances were the only category that declined, as investors gained confidence in the equity markets and shifted some of these funds accordingly. The increase in administrative expense relates primarily to performance based and profit-based incentive compensation accruals. Once again, operating leverage was evident as a modest increase in revenues led to significant rise in pretax income. 24 Results of Operations - RJBank The following table presents consolidated financial information for RJBank for the years indicated: For the Years Ended September 30, % Incr.

As a result, net interest income increased 32% to $23 million for fiscal 2005 vs. $17.5 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in loans receivable was predominantly in purchased residential mortgage loan pools, and therefore did not require significant increases in costs, with total non-interest expense actually declining 2%. This decrease is primarily the net impact of a decline in the provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is directly correlated to the net increase in loans outstanding and the mix of such loans. RJ Bank has become, and is expected to grow into, a more significant segment within the Company during the next several years. RJF contributed an additional $80 million in equity capital to RJ Bank in fiscal 2005 allowing RJ Bank to begin to grow its asset base in preparation for offering an improved deposit alternative for certain brokerage accounts. The Company currently offers customers the option of sweeping their cash awaiting investment to the Heritage Cash Trust (the money market fund managed by Heritage Asset Management) or leaving the cash in the broker-dealer - in the Client Interest Program. RJBank anticipates offering customers a competitive option beginning in late fiscal 2006. The clients will receive an equivalent money market interest rate in the bank account and their accounts will have FDIC insurance. This program is not expected to have a significant impact on the results of operations in fiscal 2006. Year ended September 24, 2004 Compared with the Year ended September 26, 2003 - RJBank The improvement in net interest income was a result of further progress in loan growth as a percentage of total assets. The decline in other income reflects the slowdown of refinancing activity, which led to fewer mortgage originations and lower fees from the subsequent sales of originated fixed rate loans. The increase in other expense encompasses a higher provision for loan losses due to the increased levels of purchased whole loan pools and outstanding commercial loan balances. RJBank policy is to maintain a substantially duration-matched portfolio of assets and liabilities. As the vast majority of liabilities are floating rate demand deposits, certain asset purchases are hedged through entering into interest rate swap contracts. Interest spreads have been negatively impacted by the effect of interest rate swaps which were put in place several years ago to hedge fixed rate assets against interest rate increases; substantially all of these contracts expire by the end of calendar 2005. 25 The combination of the factors discussed above resulted in a 13% decline in pretax income. As mentioned in previous years, current results are negatively impacted during periods of significant net loan growth as a provision for loan losses is recorded in the period of origination or purchase, while the benefit of the higher interest earnings is recognized over subsequent periods.

As the Company stock loan business is predominantly a matched book business, stock loan balances were similar. Average spreads increased from .2% in fiscal 2004 to .5% in 2005 largely due to rising interest rates, resulting in a 127% increase in net interest income. The business is well leveraged, resulting in a 179% increase in pre- tax profits. 26 Results of Operations - Other The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Other segment for the years indicated: For the Years Ended September 30, % Incr.

The segment also includes the investment results from the private equity investments made at the corporate level, including 30 partnerships managed independently of Raymond James and two managed by Raymond James subsidiaries. Expenses are predominately executive incentive compensation expense, which increased due to improved corporate earnings. Year ended September 24, 2004 Compared with the Year ended September 26, 2003 - Emerging Markets, Stock Loan/Borrow, and Other Net interest income improved as securities lending balances were much higher than in the prior year and the balance of free cash was also higher, enough so that the parent company term loan ($50 million balance at payoff) was repaid in August 2004, more than a year ahead of maturity. Other income reflects the improved performance of the Company consolidated joint ventures in emerging markets, particularly in Turkey. Statement of Financial Condition Analysis The Company statement of financial condition consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which are segregated for customers), receivables and payables. The statement of financial condition is primarily liquid in nature, providing the Company with flexibility in financing its business. Total assets of $8.4 billion at September 30, 2005 were up 10% over September 24, 2004. This increase is made up of increases in cash, receivables from brokerage and bank clients and an increase in the assets held by consolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ) net of a decline in stock borrowed balances. The assets of the consolidated VIEs include cash, other receivables and investments in real estate partnerships. Total liabilities have increased 8% since the prior fiscal year end. This increase is made up of increased payables to brokerage and bank clients, and an increase in the loans payable of the consolidated VIEs net of the decrease in stock loaned. The gross assets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs are expected to increase as the tax credit fund business grows and establishes additional multi-investor funds. This growth is expected to have a minimal net impact on the Company. The broker-dealer gross assets and liabilities, including stock loan/stock borrow, receivables and payables from/to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and clients fluctuate with the Company's business levels and overall market conditions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005 was approximately $434 million. Cash was provided by earnings and increased brokerage client cash balances. This increase in cash was offset by increased receivables from clients arising from normal cash and margin transactions and fees receivable. Cash was also impacted by investments in real estate partnerships held by variable interest entities. Since the Company ownership interest in these variable interest entities range from .01% to 1%, the net cash impact was offset by the change in minority interest. The remainder of the cash used is attributed to the net fluctuations in various other asset and liability accounts. Investing activities used $323 million in cash, which is primarily due to loans originated and purchased by RJBank, the purchases of available for sale securities, and capital expenditures, net of loan repayments and the maturation and repayments of available for sale securities. 27 Financing activities provided $354 million, the result of an increase in deposits at RJBank and proceeds from borrowed funds related to VIEs, net of the payment of cash dividends. The Company has loans payable consisting primarily of a $70 million mortgage on its headquarters office complex, a $1.1 million mortgage on the office of a foreign joint venture, and $70 million in Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances at RJBank. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries have the following lines of credit: RJF has a committed $100 million line of credit, RJA has uncommitted bank lines of credit aggregating $435 million with commercial banks, Raymond James Credit Corporation has a line of credit for $25 million, and RJ Ltd. has a CDN$40 uncommitted million line of credit. The committed RJF line of credit was increased to $200 million from $100 million on October 13, 2005. At September 30, 2005, the Company had approximately $5.3 million in outstanding loans against these lines of credit. Additionally, RJBank had $325 million in credit available from the FHLB at September 30, 2005. The Company has committed a total of $34.9 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000 to $1.5 million, to 36 different independent venture capital or private equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2005, the Company has invested $26.8 million of that amount. Additionally, the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount, the Company has invested $10.7 million as of September 30, 2005. Management has been authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase its common stock at their discretion for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock repurchase plan at this time. In May 2004 the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $75 million of shares. As of September 30, 2005 the unused portion of this authorization was $73.1 million. The Company has committed to lend to or guarantee obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, RJ Tax Credit Funds, Inc. ( RJTCF ), of up to $90 million upon request, subject to certain limitations as well as annual review and renewal. RJTCF borrows in order to invest in partnerships which purchase and develop properties qualifying for tax credits. These investments in project partnerships are then sold to various tax credit funds, which have third party investors, that RJTCF serves as the managing member or general partner. RJTCF typically sells these investments within 90-days of their acquisition, and the proceeds from the sales are used to repay RJTCF borrowings. Additionally, RJTCF may make short-term loans or advances to project partnerships on behalf of the tax credit funds in which it serves as managing member or general partner. At September 30, 2005 guarantees outstanding to various tax credit funds totaled $1.1 million and cash funded to invest in either loans or investments in project partnerships was $40.9 million. In addition, at September 30, 2005 RJTCF is committed to additional future fundings of $6.5 million related to project partnerships that have not yet been sold to various tax credit funds. The Company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with two major domestic airlines (Delta and Continental). The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines' ability to fulfill their lease obligations. In the event that the airlines default on their lease commitments and the Trustees for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the planes with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment. Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pretax charge to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to Delta. The Company had taken a $4 million pretax charge in the prior year to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges represents a cash expenditure; however, in the event of a material modification to the lease or foreclosure of the aircraft by the debt holders, certain tax payments of up to approximately $8.7 million could be accelerated. The expected tax payments are currently reflected on the statement of financial condition as a deferred tax liability and are not expected to result in a further charge to earnings. The Company also has an outstanding leveraged lease with Continental valued at $11.8 million as of September 30, 2005. To date, Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company. Given the difficult economic environment for the airline industry, the Company is closely monitoring this investment for specific events or circumstances that would allow reasonable estimation of any potential impairment and accelerated tax liability. The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC and the IDA relating to liquidity and capital standards. The domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RJA, a member firm of the NYSE, is also subject to the rules of the NYSE, whose requirements are substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not to exceed 15 times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides for an alternative net capital requirement , which both RJA and RJFS have elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250,000 or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client transactions. The NYSE may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its net capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit Items. Both RJA and RJFS had excess capital as of September 30, 2005. 28 RJ Ltd. is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the IDA) and the Early Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IDA). The Minimum Capital Rule requires that every member shall have and maintain at all times Risk Adjusted Capital greater than zero calculated in accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such requirements as the Board of Directors of the IDA may from time to time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted Capital may result in suspension from membership in the stock exchanges or the IDA. The Early Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a member firm is encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain sanctions on members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 according to its capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of designation or at the discretion of the IDA. Restrictions on business activities and capital transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective measures are sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System. RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 during fiscal 2005 or 2004. RJBank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined). Management believes, as of September 30, 2005, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. Critical Accounting Policies The Company financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following is a summary of the Company critical accounting policies. For a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. These critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgments based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the Company. Valuation of Securities and Other Assets Trading securities and Available for sale securities are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. In accordance with SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. The following table presents the Company trading and available for sale securities segregated into cash (i.e., non-derivative) trading instruments, derivative contracts, and available for sale securities: September 30, 2005 Financial Instruments Owned at Fair Value Financial Instruments Sold but not yet Purchased at Fair Value (in 000 s) Cash trading instruments $ 346,884 $ 132,107 Derivative contracts 12,795 2,488 Available for sale securities 187,549 - Total $ 547,228 $ 134,595 29 Cash Trading Instruments and Available for Sale Securities When available, the Company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices, or broker or dealer price quotations to derive the fair value of the instruments. For investments in illiquid, privately held or other securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company uses estimated fair values as determined by management. The following table presents the carrying value of cash trading, available for sale securities, and derivative contracts for which fair value is measured based on quoted prices or other independent sources versus those for which fair value is determined by management: September 30, 2005 Financial Instruments Owned at Fair Value F inancial Instruments Sold but not yet Purchased at Fair Value (in 000 s) Fair value based on quoted prices and independent sources $ 530,341 $ 132,107 Fair value determined by Management 16,887 2,488 Total $ 547,228 $ 134,595 Derivative Contracts Fair value for derivative contracts are obtained from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions. Investment in Leveraged Leases The Company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with two major domestic airlines (Delta and Continental). The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines' ability to fulfill its lease obligations. In the event that the airlines default on their lease commitments and the Trustees for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the planes with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment. Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pretax charge to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to Delta. The Company took a $4 million pretax charge in the prior year to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges represents cash expenditure; however, in the event of a material modification to the lease or foreclosure of the aircraft by the debt holders, certain tax payments of up to approximately $8.7 million could be accelerated. The expected tax payments are currently reflected on the statement of financial condition as a deferred tax liability and are not expected to result in a further charge to earnings. The Company also has an outstanding leveraged lease with Continental valued at $11.8 million as of Sept. 30, 2005. The Company's equity investment represented 20% of the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be 15% of the original cost. This lease expires in September 2013. Although Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of the Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. Given the difficult economic environment for the airline industry, the Company is closely monitoring this investment for specific events or circumstances that would allow reasonable estimation of any potential impairment. Goodwill Intangible assets consist predominantly of goodwill related to the acquisitions of Roney & Co. (now part of RJA) and Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now called Raymond James Ltd). This goodwill, totaling $63 million, was allocated to the reporting units within the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments pursuant to SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. 30 The Company reviews its goodwill in order to determine whether its value is impaired on at least an annual basis. Goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. When available, the Company uses recent, comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the respective reporting units. The Company calculates an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues, earnings, and book value of comparable transactions. However, when such comparable transactions are not available or have become outdated, the Company uses discounted cash flow scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. As of September 30, 2005, goodwill had been allocated to the Private Client Group of RJA, and both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments of RJ Ltd. As of the most recent impairment test, the Company determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired. However, changes in current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill. As required, the Company will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Reserves The Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount; if not determinable, the Company accrues at least the minimum of the range of probable loss. The Company records reserves related to legal proceedings in "other payables". Such reserves are established and maintained in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", and Financial Interpretation No. 14. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management. Management considers many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the Company; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Lastly, each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage will apply, in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly. Any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge/credit to earnings in that period. The Company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables and loans. Client receivables at the broker-dealers are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients. Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. Client loans at RJBank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property. RJBank provides for both an allowance for losses in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , and a reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by a Creditor for Impairment of a Loan . The calculation of the SFAS No. 5 allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan portfolio into different classes and assigns each class an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans. The factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve percentage to each class include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and terms; changes in geographic distribution, lending policies, local, regional, and national economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk and past loss history. In addition, the Company provides for potential losses inherent in RJBank unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted for an estimated probability of funding. For individual loans identified as impaired, RJBank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. At September 30, 2005, the amortized cost of all RJBank loans was $1.0 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $7.6 million was recorded against that balance. The allowance for loan losses is approximately 0.76% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio. The Company also makes loans or pays advances to Financial Advisors, primarily for recruiting and retention purposes. The Company provides for an allowance for loan losses on such receivables based on historical collection experience. Additionally, the Company provides for a specific reserve on these receivables if a Financial Advisor is no longer associated with the Company and it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected. At September 30, 2005 the receivable from Financial Advisors was $70.1 million, which is net of an allowance of $9.2 million for estimated uncollectibility. 31 Income Taxes SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Effects of recently issued accounting standards In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) in Issue 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights on the guidance on how general partners in a limited partnership should determine whether they control a limited partnership. This consensus is effective for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed, and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified, subsequent to the date of the ratification of this consensus (June 29, 2005). The guidance in this issue is effective for existing partnerships no later than the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted this EITF for partnerships created after June 29, 2005 and is currently evaluating the potential impact of this EITF for partnerships created prior to June 29, 2005. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 123R (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment". This statement requires the recognition in an employer financial statements of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. It also requires the cost to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, and its related interpretations. In March 2005, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, Share-Based Payment, which expresses views of the SEC Staff about the application of SFAS No. 123R. In April 2005 the SEC amended the effective date of SFAS No. 123R to allow an SEC registrant to implement this statement at the beginning of its next fiscal year, beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements given that it adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 effective September 28, 2002. In March 2004, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF in Issue 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments on the guidance to be used in determining when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This consensus ratified by the FASB in March 2004 was effective for other-than-temporary impairment evaluations made in reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004. However, the guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1, related to determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary and measuring the related impairment loss, has been delayed by FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) EITF Issue 03-1-1, "Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1. The delay of the effective date for paragraphs 10-20 will be superseded concurrent with the final issuance of proposed FSP EITF Issue 03-1-a, "Implication Guidance for the Application of Paragraph 16 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, 'The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments . This FSP nullifies certain requirements of Issue 03-1 and supersedes EITF Topic No. D-44, Recognition of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a Security Whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value. The guidance in this FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the impact of adopting the provisions of this EITF will be material to its consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Information concerning the Company's off balance sheet arrangements are included in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference. 32 Contractual Obligations The Company has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with its short and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership investments, commitments to extend credit, and a naming rights agreement (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's commitments). The following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year (in 000's): Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Long-term debt $141,124 $2,604 $2,760 $7,927 $3,104 $8,291 $116,438 Variable interest entities loans payable (1) 144,780 2,516 28,790 12,947 13,234 12,741 74,552 Short-term debt 5,338 5,338 - - - - - Operating leases 78,675 20,493 18,389 13,327 9,241 7,468 9,757 Investments - private equity partnerships (2) 11,400 11,400 - - - - - Investments - foreign entities 425 425 - - - - - Certificates of deposit 220,660 120,380 25,737 23,460 29,434 21,649 - Commitments to extend credit - RJBank (3) 299,571 299,571 - - - - - Commitments to real estate partnerships (4) 6,508 6,508 - - - - - Underwriting commitments (5) 68,227 68,227 - - - - - Naming rights for Raymond James Stadium 16,645 2,914 3,031 3,152 3,278 3,409 861 Total $993,353 $540,376 $78,707 $60,813 $58,291 $53,558 $201,608 (1) Loans which are non-recourse to the Company. See Notes 6 and 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) The Company has committed a total of $34.9 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000 to $1.5 million, to 36 different independent venture capital or private equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2005, the Company had invested $26.8 million of that amount. Additionally, the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount, the Company has invested $10.7 million as of September 30, 2005.
