Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. References in this document to Viacom, Company, we, us and our mean Viacom Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. Significant components of the management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition section include: 31 Table of Contents Page Overview : The overview section provides a summary of Viacom and our reportable business segments and the principal factors affecting our results of operations. 32 Results of Operations : The results of operations section provides an analysis of our results on a consolidated and reportable segment basis for the three years ended September 30, 2015. In addition, we provide a discussion of items affecting the comparability of our results of operations. 34 Liquidity and Capital Resources : The liquidity and capital resources section provides a discussion of our cash flows for the three years ended September 30, 2015, and of our outstanding debt, commitments and contingencies existing as of September 30, 2015. 43 Market Risk : The market risk section discusses how we manage exposure to market and interest rate risks. 47 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates : The critical accounting policies and estimates section provides detail with respect to accounting policies that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements. 48 Other Matters : The other matters section provides a discussion of related party transactions and agreements. 52 OVERVIEW Summary We are home to premier global media brands that create compelling television programs, motion pictures, short-form content, apps, games, consumer products, social media experiences and other entertainment content for audiences in 180 countries. We operate through two reporting segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment . Our measure of segment performance is adjusted operating income/(loss). We define adjusted operating income/(loss) for our segments as operating income/(loss), before equity-based compensation and certain other items identified as affecting comparability, including restructuring and programming charges, when applicable. Equity-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of performance since it is set and approved by the Compensation Committee of Viacom Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management, and is included as a component of consolidated adjusted operating income. When applicable, we use consolidated adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) from continuing operations, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because they clarify our actual operating performance, make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and diluted EPS as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. For a reconciliation of our adjusted measures and discussion of the items affecting comparability, refer to the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability . Media Networks Our Media Networks segment, which includes brands such as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, SPIKE, BET, CMT, TV Land, Nick at Nite, Nick Jr., Channel 5 (UK), Logo, Nicktoons, TeenNick and Paramount Channel, among others, provides entertainment content and related branded products for consumers in targeted demographics attractive to advertisers, content distributors and retailers. We create, acquire and distribute programming and other content for our audiences across multiple platforms, which allows our audiences to engage and interact with our content in a variety of ways: through traditional cable and satellite distribution, on connected TVs, PCs, tablets and other mobile devices, and using apps, browsers and other interfaces. Our Media Networks segment generates revenues in three categories: (i) the sale of advertising and marketing services, (ii) affiliate fees from cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite television operators, mobile networks, video-on- 32 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) demand services, and other distributors of our programming and program services, and (iii) ancillary revenues, which include consumer products licensing, brand licensing, sale of content on DVDs and Blu-ray discs, licensing of our content for download-to-own and download-to-rent services and television syndication. Demand and pricing for our advertising depend on the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers, viewership, and overall market conditions. We also drive additional demand through integrated sales of multi-platform advertising and marketing opportunities and through our integrated marketing services, providing unique branded entertainment and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers. Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions, and may fluctuate depending on the success of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Audience measurement ratings may vary due to the success of our programming, the timing of availability of new episodes of popular programming, and the performance of competing programs and other entertainment alternatives for viewers, as well as variations related to the methods used by third parties to measure ratings. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to seasonal variations, the timing of holidays and significant programming events such as awards shows or premieres. Typically, advertising revenues are highest in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Affiliate revenue agreements with multichannel television service providers are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases that provide us with a reasonably stable source of revenues. The amount of the fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of these affiliate agreements are staggered. Under certain other distribution agreements, we make multiple programs available for distribution on one or more dates, and our revenue under these arrangements may fluctuate depending on the initial availability of the programs licensed. Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming, volume of content available during a particular period and acceptance of our or our partners products. Media Networks segment expenses consist of operating expenses, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses are comprised of costs related to original and acquired programming, including programming amortization, expenses associated with the distribution of home entertainment products and consumer products licensing, participation fees, integrated marketing expenses and other costs of sales. SG&A expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, marketing, research and professional service fees and facility and occupancy costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses reflect depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders financed under capital leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment produces, finances, acquires and distributes motion pictures, television programming and other entertainment content under the Paramount Pictures, Paramount Vantage, Paramount Classics, Paramount Animation, Insurge Pictures, Nickelodeon Movies, MTV Films and Paramount Television brands. Paramount Television develops and produces programming for television and video-on-demand platforms. Motion pictures produced, acquired and/or distributed by the Filmed Entertainment segment are exhibited theatrically domestically and internationally, and then released in various ways such as download-to-own, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, transactional video-on-demand, pay television, subscription video-on-demand, basic cable television, free television, free video-on-demand and, in some cases, by airlines and hotels (the distribution windows ). Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenues worldwide principally from: (i) the theatrical release and/or distribution of motion pictures, (ii) home entertainment, which includes sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs relating to the motion pictures we release theatrically and direct-to-DVD, as well as content distributed on behalf of Viacom and third parties, transactional video-on-demand and download-to-own services, (iii) licensing of film and television exhibition rights to pay and basic cable television, free television, subscription video-on-demand and free video-on-demand services and (iv) ancillary revenues from providing production services to third parties, primarily at Paramount studio lot, licensing of its brands for consumer products, theme parks, and other uses, and distribution of content specifically developed for digital platforms. Paramount releases films theatrically in domestic and international markets and generates revenues from audience ticket sales. Each motion picture is a separate and distinct product with its revenues, and ultimate profitability, dependent upon many factors, among which audience response is of fundamental importance. Theatrical revenues may be also affected by the number, timing and mix of competitive releases in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. The theatrical success of a motion picture is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment sales and license fees for television and other platforms. Revenues from motion picture theatrical releases tend to be cyclical with increases around the holidays that fall during the first 33 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) quarter of our fiscal year, and in the summer months during our fourth quarter. Our home entertainment revenues may be affected by the number, timing and mix of home entertainment releases in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and overall economic conditions, including consumer preference for rental or purchase and trends in discretionary spending. The mix of our revenues from home entertainment continues to shift away from physical home entertainment toward consumption through various platforms and apps. Filmed Entertainment segment expenses consist of operating expenses, SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses principally include the amortization of film costs of our released feature films (including participations and residuals), print and advertising expenses and other distribution costs. We incur marketing costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows. Such costs are incurred to generate public interest in our films and are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film theatrical exhibition and profitability may not be realized until well after a film theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows. SG&A expenses include employee compensation, facility and occupancy costs, professional service fees and other overhead costs. Depreciation and amortization expense principally consists of depreciation of fixed assets.

Our effective income tax rate was 31.2% in 2015 , as compared with 31.4% in 2014 , excluding the impact of discrete tax items. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.04 per diluted share to $5.44 , reflecting the impact of fewer outstanding shares, partially offset by lower net earnings. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable $0.14 impact on adjusted diluted EPS. In addition to the operating items mentioned above, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom exclude a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $18 million in 2015 and $11 million in 2014, as well as discrete taxes in both years. Including these items in both years, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom decreased $470 million , or 20% , and diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased $0.70 per diluted share to $4.73 . Segment Results of Operations Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations.

Advertising Worldwide advertising revenues increased $54 million , or 1% , to $5.007 billion in the year ended September 30, 2015 . Domestic advertising revenues decreased 7% .

Revenues Worldwide revenues were substantially flat at $13.783 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 . Filmed Entertainment revenues decreased $557 million , principally due to lower revenues across the distribution windows reflecting the number and mix of films. Media Networks contributed a partially offsetting increase in revenues of $515 million principally reflecting higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $183 million , or 5% , to $4.125 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 . Media Networks adjusted operating income increased $175 million , reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in expenses. Filmed Entertainment adjusted operating income decreased $29 million , reflecting the benefit of Marvel distribution rights sales in the prior year. Corporate expenses decreased 10% in the period, primarily due to lower deferred compensation costs. Adjusted results exclude the impact of a $43 million non-cash impairment charge in 2014 and the impact of $106 million of restructuring, asset impairment and other charges in 2013. Including these items in both years, operating income increased $246 million , or 6% . See the section entitled Segment Results of Operations for a more in-depth discussion of the revenues, expenses and adjusted operating income for each of the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $60 million , or 3% , to $2.376 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 . The increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income described above, higher equity in net earnings of investee companies and a lower effective income tax rate were partially offset by an increase in interest expense, reflecting higher levels of debt outstanding, and higher net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, which includes the renewal of a content distribution arrangement at a consolidated majority-owned joint venture. Our effective income tax rate was 31.4% in 2014, as compared with 32.9% in 2013, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is principally due to incremental tax benefits associated with qualified production activities, as well as a change in the mix of domestic and international income. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.72 per diluted share to $5.40 , reflecting fewer outstanding shares and the impact of higher tax-effected adjusted operating income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. In addition to the operating items mentioned above, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom exclude a loss on the extinguishment of debt in 2014 and gains from the sales of our 20% interest in HBO Pacific Partners, V.O.F.

Domestic theatrical revenues increased 2% due to the strength of our current year releases, while international revenues decreased 6% . Foreign exchange had a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact on international theatrical revenues. Home Entertainment Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased $413 million , or 26% , to $1.164 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 , driven by lower revenues from our current year releases of $385 million due to the number and mix of titles released and lower carryover and catalog revenues of $28 million. In the current year, we released nine titles, including Transformers : Age of Extinction , Noah , The Wolf of Wall Street , Jackass : Bad Grandpa , Anchorman 2 : The Legend Continues , Jack Ryan : Shadow Recruit and Paranormal Activity : The Marked Ones . In the prior year period, we released fourteen titles, including Madagascar 3 : Europe Most Wanted , Star Trek into Darkness , Rise of the Guardians , G.I. Joe : Retaliation and World War Z . Domestic and international home entertainment revenues decreased 32% and 18% , respectively. Foreign exchange had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on international home entertainment revenues. License Fees License fees decreased $91 million , or 8% , to $1.115 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 , primarily driven by lower international syndication revenues due to mix of available titles. Ancillary Ancillary revenues decreased $23 million , or 9% , to $237 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 , reflecting a higher benefit from distribution rights sales in the prior year. 40 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Expenses Filmed Entertainment segment expenses decreased $528 million , or 13% , to $3.520 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 , primarily driven by lower operating expenses. Operating Operating expenses decreased $485 million , or 14% , to $3.031 billion in the year ended September 30, 2014 , as a result of the number and mix of films. Distribution and other costs, principally print and advertising expenses, decreased $262 million , or 16% , primarily driven by the number and mix of current year theatrical and home entertainment releases. Film costs decreased $223 million , or 12% , reflecting lower participation costs on third-party distribution arrangements. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses decreased $18 million , or 4% , to $425 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 , principally driven by lower employee costs. Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income was $205 million in the year ended September 30, 2014 , compared with $234 million in 2013. The prior year results included the benefit of higher distribution rights sales. Factors Affecting Comparability The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three years ended September 30, 2015 reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP. Results for the aforementioned periods, as discussed in the section entitled Overview , have been affected by certain items identified as affecting comparability. Accordingly, when applicable, we use adjusted measures to evaluate our actual operating performance. The following tables reconcile our adjusted measures to our reported results for the three years ended September 30, 2015 . The tax impacts included in the tables have been calculated using the rates applicable to the adjustments presented. 2015 Year Ended September 30, 2015 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Pre-tax Earnings from Continuing Operations Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results $ 3,112 $ 2,503 $ 1,922 $ 4.73 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring and programming charges 784 784 520 1.28 Loss on pension settlement 24 24 15 0.04 Loss on extinguishment of debt 18 11 0.03 Discrete tax benefits (258 ) (0.64 ) Adjusted results $ 3,920 $ 3,329 $ 2,210 $ 5.44 Restructuring and programming charges : We recognized pre-tax charges of $784 million, reflecting $578 million of programming charges and a $206 million restructuring charge associated with workforce reductions. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss on pension settlement : The pre-tax non-cash charge of $24 million was driven by the settlement of pension benefits of certain participants of our funded pension plan. Loss on extinguishment of debt : In September 2015, we redeemed $550 million of the total $918 million outstanding of our 6.250% Senior Notes due April 2016, at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount and a make-whole amount, together totaling $568 million, and accrued interest of $14 million. As a result of the redemption, we recognized a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $18 million. 41 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Discrete tax benefits : During 2015, we reorganized certain non-U.S. subsidiaries in order to facilitate a more efficient movement of non-U.S. cash and to support the expansion of key areas for growth internationally. The net discrete tax benefits are principally related to excess foreign tax credits attributable to a taxable repatriation of non-U.S. earnings from reorganized entities and the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions. Our effective income tax rate was 31.2% in 2015, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. Discrete tax benefits of $258 million, taken together with the other factors affecting comparability discussed above, contributed 11.2 percentage points of benefit to the effective tax rate, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 20.0% . 2014 Year Ended September 30, 2014 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Pre-tax Earnings from Continuing Operations Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results $ 4,082 $ 3,514 $ 2,392 $ 5.43 Factors Affecting Comparability: Asset impairment 43 43 26 0.06 Loss on extinguishment of debt 11 7 0.02 Discrete tax benefits (49 ) (0.11 ) Adjusted results $ 4,125 $ 3,568 $ 2,376 $ 5.40 Asset impairment : As a result of strategic decisions made by us resulting in channel realignment in several international markets, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $43 million related to an international trade name at Media Networks . Loss on extinguishment of debt : In April 2014, we redeemed all $600 million of our outstanding 4.375% Senior Notes due September 2014 at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount and a make-whole amount, together totaling $611 million, and accrued and unpaid interest of $1 million. As a result of the redemption, we recognized a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $11 million . Discrete tax benefits : Our net discrete tax benefits are principally related to the reversal of deferred taxes on earnings deemed permanently reinvested and the recognition of capital loss carryforwards . Our effective income tax rate was 31.4% in 2014, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. Discrete tax benefits of $49 million , taken together with the other factors affecting comparability discussed above, contributed 1.5 percentage points of benefit to the effective tax rate, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 29.9% . 2013 Year Ended September 30, 2013 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Pre-tax Earnings from Continuing Operations Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results $ 3,836 $ 3,519 $ 2,407 $ 4.86 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring, asset impairment and other charges 106 106 74 0.15 Gain on sale of HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV (111 ) (111 ) (0.22 ) Discrete tax benefits (54 ) (0.11 ) Adjusted results $ 3,942 $ 3,514 $ 2,316 $ 4.68 Restructuring, asset impairment and other charges : During 2013, we approved a restructuring plan which included severance charges of $86 million ($61 million at Media Networks and $25 million at Filmed Entertainment ). We also incurred a $7 million intangible asset impairment charge resulting from the decision to abandon the asset and $13 million of charges related to management decision to cease use of certain original and acquired programming on one of our Media Networks channels. 42 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Gain on sale of HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV : In 2013, we completed the sales of our 20% interest in HBO Pacific Partners and our 22.5% interest in LAPTV, partnerships that own pay television channels under various brand names and that were accounted for under the equity method. The sales resulted in aggregate total proceeds of $124 million and gain of $111 million . The tax provision associated with the gains was offset by the reversal of a valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards. Discrete tax benefits : Our net discrete tax benefits principally reflect the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions, as well as the recognition of certain capital loss carryforward and tax credit benefits. Our effective income tax rate was 32.9% in 2013, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. Discrete tax benefits of $54 million , taken together with the effective income tax rate impact of the other factors affecting comparability discussed above, contributed 2.5 percentage points of benefit to the effective tax rate, which reconciles to the reported effective tax rate of 30.4% . LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided through the operations of our businesses. We have access to external financing sources such as our $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility and the capital markets. Our principal uses of cash from operations include the creation of new programming and film content, acquisitions of third-party content, and interest and income tax payments. We also use cash for discretionary share repurchases under our stock repurchase program, as deemed appropriate, as well as quarterly cash dividends, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses. The Media Networks segment consistently generates a significant percentage of our cash flow from operating activities. Advertising is generally purchased by large media buying agencies and our affiliate fees are earned from cable and satellite television operators and other distributors. The Filmed Entertainment segment operational results and ability to generate cash flow from operations substantially depend on the number and timing of films in development and production, the level and timing of print and advertising costs and the public response to our theatrical film and home entertainment releases. In general, our segments require relatively low levels of capital expenditures in relation to our annual cash flow from operations. This contributes to our ability to generate cash flow for future investment in our content and business operations, which we expect to be able to maintain over time. We use commercial paper borrowings, backstopped by our credit facility, to fund short-term domestic liquidity needs principally driven by the timing of our domestic operating cash flows and the amount of share repurchases in the period. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $506 million as of September 30, 2015 , of which $446 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and is substantially all deemed permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. While we currently do not intend or foresee a need for repatriating funds held in our foreign subsidiaries, should we require additional capital in the United States ( U.S. ), we could elect to repatriate these funds or access external financing. Repatriating funds could result in a higher effective tax rate and cash taxes paid. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities together with our credit facility provide us with adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements. We anticipate that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and future access to capital markets, including our credit facility. We may continue to access external financing from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions and after-tax cost of capital. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding given our expected cash needs. Any new borrowing cost would be affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us. 43 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Cash Flows The net change in cash and cash equivalents for each of the years ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is detailed below: Cash Flows (in millions) Year Ended September 30, 2015 2014 2013 Cash provided by operations $ 2,313 $ 2,597 $ 3,083 Net cash flow used in investing activities (257 ) (855 ) (335 ) Net cash flow used in financing activities (2,477 ) (3,100 ) (1,159 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (73 ) (45 ) (34 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (494 ) $ (1,403 ) $ 1,555 Operating Activities Cash provided by operations was $2.313 billion in 2015 , a decrease of $284 million compared with 2014 . The decrease primarily reflects an increase in programming spending, partially offset by lower income tax payments. Cash provided by operations was $2.597 billion in 2014 , a decrease of $486 million compared with 2013 . The decrease is primarily driven by higher income tax payments. See Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income tax payments. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $257 million in 2015 , principally reflecting capital expenditures and our investment in Prism TV Private Limited. Cash used in investing activities was $855 million in 2014 , principally reflecting the purchase price for the acquisition of Channel 5 and capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $335 million in 2013 , which included payments related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of a discontinued operation and capital expenditures, partially offset by $124 million of proceeds received from the sales of our investments in HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $2.477 billion in 2015 , primarily driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $1.548 billion , dividend payments of $564 million and net payments of $410 million from debt transactions. Proceeds of $990 million from the issuance of senior notes and debentures with an aggregate face value of $1.0 billion were more than offset by debt repayments of $1.400 billion . Cash used in financing activities was $3.100 billion in 2014 , driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $3.529 billion and dividend payments of $541 million , partially offset by net proceeds of $884 million from debt transactions. Proceeds of $1.484 billion from the issuance of senior notes and debentures with an aggregate face value of $1.5 billion were partially offset by the debt extinguishment payment of $600 million . Cash used in financing activities was $1.159 billion in 2013 , driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $4.664 billion and dividend payments of $555 million , partially offset by the issuance of senior notes and debentures for aggregate net cash proceeds of $3.732 billion , stock option proceeds of $403 million and $97 million from excess tax benefits, which represents the actual tax deductions in excess of amounts previously recognized. In May 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share of Class A and Class B common stock from $0.33 per share, beginning with the dividend paid on July 1, 2015. 44 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Capital Resources Capital Structure and Debt At September 30, 2015 , total debt was $12.285 billion , a decrease of $414 million from $12.699 billion at September 30, 2014 . The decrease in debt reflects the impact of the repayment of senior notes, partially offset by new issuances of senior notes and debentures. Debt (in millions) September 30, 2015 2014 Senior notes and debentures $ 12,142 $ 12,531 Capital leases and other obligations 143 168 Total debt $ 12,285 $ 12,699 Amounts classified in the current portion of debt consist of the portion of capital leases and other obligations payable in the next twelve months. Senior Notes and Debentures In December 2014, we issued a total of $1.0 billion of senior notes and debentures as follows: 2.750% Senior Notes due December 2019 with an aggregate principal amount of $400 million at a price equal to 99.986% of the principal amount. 4.850% Senior Debentures due December 2034 with an aggregate principal amount of $600 million at a price equal to 99.543% of the principal amount. The proceeds, net of the discount and other issuance fees and expenses, from the issuance of the senior notes and debentures were $990 million . We utilized a portion of the proceeds for the repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.250% Senior Notes due February 2015. We utilized the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of shares under our stock repurchase program. In September 2015, we repaid the $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.250% Senior Notes. We also redeemed $550 million of the total $918 million outstanding of our 6.250% Senior Notes due April 2016 (the "April 2016 Notes"), at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount and a make-whole amount, together totaling $568 million, and accrued interest of $14 million. As a result of the redemption, we recognized a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $18 million. The remaining portion of the April 2016 Notes are classified as long-term debt as we have the intent as well as the ability, through utilization of our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, to refinance this debt. Our outstanding senior notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is one acceleration trigger for certain of the senior notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under certain specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control. At September 30, 2015 and 2014 , the total unamortized discount and issuance fees and expenses related to the fixed rate senior notes and debentures was $478 million and $489 million , respectively. Credit Facility : In November 2014, we amended our revolving credit agreement, originally dated as of October 8, 2010, to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the $2.5 billion revolving credit facility from November 9, 2017 to November 18, 2019. The credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. The borrowing rate under the credit facility is LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% based on our current public debt rating. At September 30, 2015 and 2014 , there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. The credit facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our interest coverage for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters to be at least 3.0x, which we met as of September 30, 2015. Commercial Paper : At September 30, 2015 and 2014 there was no commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper outstanding for the twelve months ending September 30, 2015 , was $1.2 billion, which had a weighted average interest rate of 0.44%. 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Stock Repurchase Program : During 2015 , we repurchased 21.1 million shares of Class B common stock for an aggregate price of $1.5 billion . From October 1, 2015 through November 11, 2015, we repurchased an additional 1.3 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $60 million, leaving $4.9 billion of remaining capacity under our program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash generated by operations, as deemed appropriate. During 2014 and 2013 , we repurchased 40.7 million and 69.2 million shares for an aggregate price of $3.4 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. Commitments and Contingencies Our commitments primarily consist of programming and talent commitments, operating and capital lease arrangements, and purchase obligations for goods and services. These arrangements result from our normal course of business and represent obligations that may be payable over several years. Additionally, we are subject to a redeemable put option (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Guarantees : In the course of our business, we both provide and receive the benefit of indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification agreement. Leases - We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. ( Famous Players ). In addition, we have certain indemnities provided by the acquirer of Famous Players. Other - We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. Legal Matters : Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that our litigation to which we are a party is not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of continuing operations, financial position or operating cash flows. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our guarantees and legal matters. Film Financing Arrangements : From time to time we enter into film financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute theatrical productions ( co-financing arrangements ). A co-financing arrangement typically involves joint ownership of the film asset with each partner responsible for distribution of the film in specific territories. The partners share in the profits and losses of the film in accordance with their respective ownership interest. 46 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include amounts reflected on our balance sheet, as well as off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2015 , our significant contractual obligations, including payments due for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, were as follows: Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 1,907 $ 730 $ 863 $ 219 $ 95 Operating leases (2) 1,887 237 403 212 1,035 Purchase obligations (3) 1,121 518 376 179 48 On-Balance Sheet Arrangements Capital lease obligations (4) 108 22 46 33 7 Debt 12,620 368 1,900 1,350 9,002 Interest payments 8,941 581 1,068 931 6,361 Other long-term obligations (5) $ 2,270 $ 1,563 $ 588 $ 108 $ 11 (1) Programming and talent commitments include $1.5 billion relating to media networks programming and $425 million for talent contracts. (2) Operating leases include long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Capital lease obligations include capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) Other long-term obligations principally consist of participations, residuals and programming obligations for content that is available for airing. Note: Not included in the amounts above are payments which may result from our defined benefit pension plans of $444 million , unrecognized tax benefits of $214 million, including interest and penalties, interest payments to be made under our credit facility, $219 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest and lease indemnification obligations of approximately $274 million . The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. Dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Indian Rupee, the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. We also enter into forward contracts to hedge future production costs or programming obligations. The change in fair value of non-designated foreign exchange contracts is included in current period earnings as part of Other items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At September 30, 2015 and 2014 , the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $1.040 billion and $628 million , respectively. In 2015, $769 million related to our foreign currency balances and $271 million related to future production costs. In 2014, $390 million related to our foreign currency balances, $154 million related to anticipated investing cash flows and $84 million related to future production costs. 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Interest Rate Risk A portion of our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. Also, interest expense for future long-term debt issues is exposed to movements in long-term rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at our discretion. There were no interest rates hedges outstanding at September 30, 2015 and 2014 . Since the majority of our debt is fixed rate, we do not expect that a 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Viacom has issued senior notes and debentures that, at September 30, 2015 , had an outstanding balance of $12.1 billion and an estimated fair value of $12.0 billion . A 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the senior notes and debentures by approximately $854 million and $993 million , respectively. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, our customers and the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonpayment by our customers and nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover any anticipated nonpayment by our customers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements. An understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to analyze our financial results. Our critical accounting policies include our accounting for original production costs, acquired programming rights, multiple-element arrangements, revenue allowances, income taxes and goodwill and other intangible assets. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Original Production Costs We capitalize original programming and feature film costs, on a title-specific basis, as Inventory, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use an individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize original production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for residuals and participations over the applicable title life cycle based upon the ratio of current period to estimated remaining total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each title. The estimate of ultimate revenues impacts the timing of amortization and accrual of residuals and participations. Our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within ten years from the date of a film initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. Prior to the release of a feature film and throughout its life, we estimate the ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as incorporating factors of the content itself, including, but not limited to, the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. We believe the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for films intended for theatrical release is domestic theatrical exhibition, as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to domestic theatrical performance. Upon a film release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for films subsequent to their initial release is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing home entertainment products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions. 48 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Upon a film initial release we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on expected future and actual results. We also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a film are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are charged or credited to our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. For original programming, capitalized program costs are amortized over the projected useful life of the programming, depending on genre and historical experience, beginning with the month of initial exhibition. The most sensitive factor affecting ultimate revenues is ratings, which are an indication of audience acceptance and directly impact the level of advertising revenues we will be able to generate during the airing of the programming. Poor ratings may result in abandonment of a program, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. If we believe that the release of our content will not be or has not been favorably received, then we would assess whether the fair value of such content is less than the unamortized portion of its capitalized costs and, if need be, recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the fair value. We utilize the individual-film-forecast-computation method (adjusted to incorporate revenue and related costs, including future exploitation costs, if any, expected to occur in periods beyond 10 years from the date of a film initial release) to develop the cash flows which are subsequently discounted to compute the fair value of a title that is being assessed for impairment. The discount rate utilized takes into account the time value of money as well as a risk premium. The risk premium reflects the uncertainties of realizing the expected cash flows of a title which is impacted by the title position within its product life cycle. Acquired Programming Rights We report an asset and liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred at the commencement of the licensing period when the cost of the programming is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted and the programming is available for airing. The asset is amortized to operating expenses over the license period or projected useful life of the programming, if shorter, commencing upon availability, based on estimated future airings. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues an accelerated method of amortization is used. Determining factors used in estimating the useful life of programming include the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, the length of the license period and expected future revenues to be generated from the programming. The cost basis of acquired programming is the capitalized cost of each program and is equal to the cost of the programming pursuant to the license agreement less the cumulative amortization recorded for the program. Capitalized costs of rights to program materials are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate net realizable value of acquired rights programming quarterly on a daypart basis. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type. We aggregate similar programming based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart as well as an allocation of affiliate fee revenue to programming. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows of similar programming are insufficient or if programming is abandoned. Multiple-Element Arrangements We enter into arrangements under which we perform multiple revenue-generating activities. We must allocate consideration to separate units of account in the arrangement, which could impact the timing of revenue recognition. Advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of advertising time comprised of multiple commercial units. Each advertising spot comprises a deliverable for accounting purposes. Consideration for these arrangements is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative fair value using Viacom-specific prices. Certain arrangements include multiple programs made available to distributors on one or more dates for a fixed fee. Consideration for such arrangements is allocated among the programs based on relative fair value using management best estimate considering viewing performance and other factors. Revenue Allowances In accordance with the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition when a right of return exists, revenue allowances are recorded to adjust amounts originally invoiced to the estimated net realizable value of a particular product. Upon the sale of home entertainment products to wholesalers and retailers, we record a reduction of revenue for the impact of estimated future returns, rebates and other incentives ( estimated returns ). In determining estimated returns, we consider numerous sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecasted sales data, customers rights of return, units shipped and units remaining at retail, historical return rates for similar product, current economic trends, competitive environment, promotions 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) and sales strategies. Forecasted sales data is determined by comparing a particular release to product that has similar characteristics where applicable, such as franchise, genre, box office levels and release patterns, using regression analysis, decay rates and other tools. Based on the results of this analysis and the sales strategies to be used for the release, we reserve an appropriate percentage of each dollar of product revenue on a title taking into consideration the qualitative and quantitative factors described above. Forecasted sales data is reviewed and updated throughout each quarter and is consistent with the projections of ultimate revenues used in applying the individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize our film costs. Accordingly, a change in forecasted sales affects both the revenue allowance and related expenses. Actual sell-through data is reviewed as it becomes available against the forecasted sales data to ensure that estimates continue to be consistent with actual sales performance. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for home entertainment products would have a $12 million impact on our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2015 . This revenue impact would be partially offset by a corresponding impact on related expenses depending on the margin associated with a specific film and other factors. We also continually evaluate accounts receivable and establish judgments as to their ultimate collectability. Judgments and estimates involved include an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts and an analysis of actual historical write-off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due. Using this information, management reserves an amount that is estimated to be uncollectible. An incremental change of 1% in our allowance for uncollectible accounts relative to our trade accounts receivables would have a $25 million impact on our operating results for the year ended September 30, 2015 . Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our annual provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. Our tax rates are impacted by the tax laws, regulations and policies in federal, state and local and international territories where our businesses operate. Changes to these laws and regulations and uncertainty generated by the prospect of future tax legislation may also affect our income tax positions, in addition to other factors, including our global mix of earnings, acquisitions and dispositions, as well as the tax characteristics of our income. In determining our income tax provisions on a jurisdiction basis, we are required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the realizability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating uncertain tax positions, we make determinations of the application of complex tax rules, regulations and practices. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors including, but not limited to, new facts, changes in tax law and information received from regulators. A change in any one of these factors could change our evaluation of an existing uncertain tax position, resulting in the recognition of an additional charge or benefit to our income tax provision in the period and may result in fluctuations in our effective income tax rate. Additionally, our income tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our income tax provisions. The resolution of audit issues and income tax positions taken may take extended periods of time due to the length of examinations by tax authorities and the possible extension of statutes of limitations. A 1% change in our effective income tax rate, excluding discrete items, would result in additional income tax expense of approximately $33 million for the year ended September 30, 2015 . We permanently reinvest the earnings of substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. We do not provide for U.S. taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for which the earnings are permanently reinvested. 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Goodwill Goodwill at September 30, 2015 relates to our reporting units Music & Entertainment ($3.5 billion), Kids & Family ($3.7 billion), BET Networks ($2.7 billion) and Paramount ($1.6 billion). We have elected to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test in 2015. We test goodwill for impairment on August 31 of each year. The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The second step, if necessary, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining these assumptions, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. To facilitate a better understanding of how these valuations are determined, a discussion of our significant assumptions, including a sensitivity analysis with respect to their impact on the estimated value of our reporting units, is provided below. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the budget and long-term business plans of each reporting unit. Such assumptions take into account numerous factors including historical experience, anticipated economic conditions, advertising sales and ratings trends, terms of affiliate license arrangements and anticipated terms of renewals, projected costs for production and programming, number and expected financial performance of films expected to be produced and distributed each year and changes in the reporting unit cost structures. Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into account our assessment of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weighted-average cost of capital. We also review marketplace data to assess the reasonableness of our computation of Viacom overall weighted-average cost of capital and, when available, the discount rates utilized for each of our reporting units. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions: Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the periods 2016 through 2020. Cash flows beyond 2020 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at between 2.5% and 3%. In order to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value, we utilized a discount rate of approximately 7.5% to 9.5% for each of our reporting units. Based on our assessment using the assumptions described above, a hypothetical 20% reduction in the estimated fair value in each of our reporting units would not result in an impairment condition. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to illustrate the impact of changes in assumptions underlying the first step of the impairment test. Based on our assessment: a one percentage point decrease in the growth rate of cash flow over the periods 2016 through 2020 would reduce the indicated fair value of our reporting units by a range of approximately 3% to 5% and would not result in an impairment of any reporting unit; a one percentage point decrease in the perpetual growth rate would reduce the indicated fair value of each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 12% to 14% and would not result in an impairment of any reporting unit; and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 15% to 16% and would not result in an impairment of any reporting unit. 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Finite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of finite-lived intangible assets if a triggering event indicates that an impairment may exist. The impairment test employed for finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., broadcast license, trade names and customer lists) first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be written down to its fair value. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, the determination of the cash flows for the assets involved and the discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. See Notes 14 and 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on intangible asset impairments in 2014 and 2013. OTHER MATTERS Related Parties In the ordinary course of business we enter into transactions with related parties, including National Amusements, Inc., CBS, their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, and companies that we account for under the equity method of accounting. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the related party transactions and their impact on the Financial Statements. Agreements with CBS Corporation In connection with our separation from CBS, effective as of January 1, 2006 (the separation ), we and CBS entered into a Separation Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement, as well as certain other agreements to govern the terms of the separation and certain of the ongoing relationships between CBS and us after the separation. These related party arrangements are more fully described below. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company is obligated to indemnify the other company and the other company officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, including with respect to certain legal matters, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any entity controlled by CBS after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations and/or television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, NAI, NAIRI Inc. or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any person controlled by CBS will acquire any asset, enter into any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party written consent.
