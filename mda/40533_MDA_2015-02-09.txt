ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Item 1. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been restated to reflect the results of operations of our axle business in discontinued operations (for further discussion, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements). BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Approximately 60 percent of our revenues are from the U.S. government. Accordingly, our financial performance is impacted by U.S. government spending levels, particularly defense spending. Over the past several years, U.S. defense spending has been reduced, due in part to the country fiscal shortfalls. Following required reductions mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) and its related sequester mechanism, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) prescribed defense top-line funding for FY 2014 and 2015 at levels generally consistent with FY 2013. The BBA also included sequester reductions of approximately $30 billion in FY 2014 and $43 billion in FY 2015, less than the amounts imposed by the BCA. In adherence to the BBA, Congress appropriated $497 billion in FY 2015 for the Department of Defense (DoD), including approximately $158 billion for procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, relatively consistent with FY 2014. These investment accounts are the source of the majority of our U.S. government revenues. The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to the U.S. military funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution. We continue to pursue opportunities outside the U.S. presented by demand for military equipment and information technologies from our non-U.S. operations and through exports from our North American businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, these opportunities are subject to changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country. In our Aerospace group, business-jet market conditions were strong in 2014. The group benefited from strong order interest for new aircraft across the group range of customers and lower customer contract defaults. We expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the Aerospace group long-term growth. Similarly, we believe the aircraft services business will continue to be a strong source of revenues as the global business-jet fleet grows. In navigating the current business environment, we continue to focus on improving operating earnings, expanding margins and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash through our emphasis on effective program execution and cost-reduction activities across the business. 25 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION An understanding of our accounting practices is important to evaluate our operating results. We recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in our Aerospace and defense groups. In the Aerospace group, contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft outfitting, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors. We record revenues on these contracts at the completion of these two phases: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft. We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors. Revenues associated with the group completions of other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) aircraft and the group services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations in revenues from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries (green and outfitted), progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period. The majority of the Aerospace group operating costs relates to new aircraft production for firm orders and consists of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace group completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred. For new aircraft, operating earnings and margins are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group earnings and margins include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the market for pre-owned aircraft, and the level of general and administrative (G&A) and net R&D costs incurred by the group. In the defense groups, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or services are rendered. As a result, variations in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume, typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs. Year-over-year variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules. Operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor, material, subcontractor, overhead and G&A costs and are recognized generally as incurred. Variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and, therefore, result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues. Operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the estimated costs to complete or both. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period compared 26 with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- vs. lower-margin work. Additionally, higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or type of work (e.g., development/production). CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW REVIEW OF 2014 VS. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 Variance Revenues $ 30,852 $ 30,930 $ (78 ) (0.3 )% Operating costs and expenses 26,963 27,241 278 1.0 % Operating earnings 3,889 3,689 200 5.4 % Operating margins 12.6 % 11.9 % Our revenues were virtually flat in 2014 compared with 2013 . Decreased U.S. Army spending continued to affect somewhat our Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems groups. This was essentially offset by higher Aerospace and Marine Systems revenues due to increased aircraft deliveries and higher ship construction activity, respectively. Operating costs and expenses decreased more than revenues in 2014 , resulting in increased operating earnings and margins. The decrease in operating costs and expenses in 2014 was due to improved performance in aircraft manufacturing and outfitting activities in the Aerospace group and significant cost reductions in the Information Systems and Technology group. The resulting consolidated operating margins of 12.6 percent were up 70 basis points over 2013 , reflecting strong operating performance across all of our groups. REVIEW OF 2013 VS. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 Variance Revenues $ 30,930 $ 30,992 $ (62 ) (0.2 )% Operating costs and expenses 27,241 30,227 2,986 9.9 % Operating earnings 3,689 765 2,924 382.2 % Operating margins 11.9 % 2.5 % While our revenues were essentially flat in 2013 compared with 2012 , operating earnings and margins increased significantly in 2013 . We experienced lower volume in our Combat Systems business as a result of decreased U.S. Army spending. This was largely offset by higher revenues in our Aerospace group from increased deliveries of G650 and G280 aircraft. Revenues increased slightly in our Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups in 2013 . Operating costs were significantly lower in 2013 due to several discrete charges taken in 2012 , including a $2 billion goodwill impairment recorded in the Information Systems and Technology group. These charges are discussed in conjunction with our business groups operating results. Even absent the charges taken in 2012, operating costs were down in 2013, the effect of cost-reduction efforts and cost savings associated with restructuring activities. 27 REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPS Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Aerospace $ 8,649 $ 1,611 $ 8,118 $ 1,416 $ 6,912 $ 858 Combat Systems 5,732 862 5,832 908 7,471 595 Information Systems and Technology 9,159 785 10,268 795 10,017 (1,369 ) Marine Systems 7,312 703 6,712 666 6,592 750 Corporate (72 ) (96 ) (69 ) $ 30,852 $ 3,889 $ 30,930 $ 3,689 $ 30,992 $ 765 Following is a discussion of the operating results and outlook for each of our business groups. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed by specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense groups, the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group results. Additional information regarding our business groups can be found in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. AEROSPACE Review of 2014 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 Variance Revenues $ 8,649 $ 8,118 $ 531 6.5 % Operating earnings 1,611 1,416 195 13.8 % Operating margins 18.6 % 17.4 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 144 139 5 3.6 % Outfitted 150 144 6 4.2 % The increase in the Aerospace group revenues in 2014 consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 605 Aircraft services 69 Pre-owned aircraft (143 ) Total increase $ 531 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues increased in 2014 primarily due to additional deliveries of large-cabin aircraft. Aircraft services activity was higher in 2014 due to growth in the number of aircraft in service and the resulting increased demand for maintenance work. We experienced reduced aircraft trade-in activity in 2014 leading to lower pre-owned aircraft sales. We had three pre-owned aircraft sales in 2014 compared to 11 in 2013 . The increase in the group operating earnings in 2014 consisted of the following: 28 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 279 Aircraft services 15 Pre-owned aircraft 5 G&A/other expenses (104 ) Total increase $ 195 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions earnings grew in 2014 due to the increase in aircraft deliveries, as well as improved operating performance on our large- and mid-cabin aircraft production. Partially offsetting this increase was higher net R&D expenses associated with ongoing product-development efforts. As a result, the Aerospace group operating margins increased 120 basis points in 2014 . Review of 2013 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 Variance Revenues $ 8,118 $ 6,912 $ 1,206 17.4 % Operating earnings 1,416 858 558 65.0 % Operating margins 17.4 % 12.4 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 139 121 18 14.9 % Outfitted 144 94 50 53.2 % The Aerospace group revenues and earnings increased in 2013 primarily due to additional deliveries of G650 and G280 aircraft. Operating earnings also increased in 2013 due to a $191 impairment of Jet Aviation maintenance business intangible asset in 2012 as the business experienced an increasingly competitive marketplace. 2015 Outlook We expect an increase of approximately 8 percent in the group revenues in 2015 compared with 2014 as a result of Gulfstream aircraft deliveries. Operating margins are expected to be around 18 percent, down somewhat from 2014 primarily due to higher net R&D expenses, aircraft manufacturing mix and more pre-owned aircraft sales. COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2014 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 Variance Revenues $ 5,732 $ 5,832 $ (100 ) (1.7 )% Operating earnings 862 908 (46 ) (5.1 )% Operating margins 15.0 % 15.6 % The change in the Combat Systems group revenues in 2014 consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (663 ) Weapons systems and munitions (61 ) International military vehicles 624 Total decrease $ (100 ) 29 U.S. military vehicle revenues were down in 2014 consistent with our expectations as a result of a decrease in U.S. Army spending as the Iraqi and Afghan conflicts wound down. This impacted our primary U.S. vehicle programs, including Stryker, Abrams, Buffalo and Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. Revenues also decreased on the completed Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) design and development program. Weapons systems and munitions volume decreased in 2014 primarily due to lower tank ammunition production for non-U.S. customers. Revenues for international military vehicles were up significantly in 2014 as work commenced on a $10 billion international order received in the first quarter. Work on this order was somewhat offset by lower revenues on several other international contracts that are nearing completion. The Combat Systems group's operating margins decreased 60 basis points in 2014 primarily due to a mix shift from more mature programs nearing completion to the start up of new programs. Somewhat offsetting this shift in contract mix, operating margins were up in our European and weapons systems businesses as a result of reduced overhead costs following restructuring activities completed in 2013 and early 2014. Review of 2013 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 Variance Revenues $ 5,832 $ 7,471 $ (1,639 ) (21.9 )% Operating earnings 908 595 313 52.6 % Operating margins 15.6 % 8.0 % In 2013 , revenues were down across the Combat Systems group. Decreased U.S. Army spending, in part due to sequestration and a government shutdown, impacted U.S. military vehicle programs, including Stryker, Abrams and MRAP, and weapons systems and munitions programs. The Combat Systems group operating earnings and margins increased significantly in 2013 despite the reduced revenues due to the negative impact of three discrete charges in 2012 in our European Land Systems business: $292 for contract dispute accruals, primarily related to the termination of a contract to provide Pandur vehicles for Portugal ($169 of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues); $98 of restructuring-related charges, primarily severance, for activities associated with eliminating excess capacity; and $67 of out-of-period adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2012 ($48 of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues). These charges reduced the group 2012 operating margins approximately 570 basis points. Operating earnings and margins increased in 2013 due to strong operating performance across our U.S. businesses and the favorable impact of cost savings associated with restructuring activities in our European military vehicles business. 2015 Outlook We expect the Combat Systems group revenues and margins in 2015 to be consistent with 2014 as growth on our international military vehicle contracts offsets some scheduled reductions in spending on a few U.S. military production programs. 30 INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2014 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 Variance Revenues $ 9,159 $ 10,268 $ (1,109 ) (10.8 )% Operating earnings 785 795 (10 ) (1.3 )% Operating margins 8.6 % 7.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group revenues in 2014 were lower than 2013 , though higher than our initial expectations. The decrease from the prior year consisted of the following: Mobile communication systems $ (886 ) Information technology (IT) solutions and mission support services (185 ) Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) solutions (38 ) Total decrease $ (1,109 ) Revenues decreased nearly 25 percent in the mobile communication systems business in 2014 primarily as a result of lower U.S. Army spending on certain programs, including the Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) radio, Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) and Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) programs. Revenues decreased in 2014 in our IT services business due to lower volume on several programs, including our commercial wireless work. This decrease was partially offset by increased contact-center services work under our contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Revenues were essentially flat in our ISR business. Despite the revenue decline, the group's operating margins increased 90 basis points in 2014 , the result of solid operating performance and ongoing cost-reduction efforts across all our lines of business. As part of these efforts, we consolidated two businesses in the group effective in January of 2015 in an effort to be more efficient and responsive to our customers. Review of 2013 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 Variance Revenues $ 10,268 $ 10,017 $ 251 2.5 % Operating earnings (loss) 795 (1,369 ) 2,164 (158.1 )% Operating margins 7.7 % (13.7 )% The Information Systems and Technology group revenues increased in 2013 compared with 2012 as higher volume in the mobile communication systems and IT services businesses was partially offset by decreased revenues in the ISR business. Revenues increased in 2013 in the mobile communication systems business due to higher volume on programs that received production awards in late 2012 or 2013, including WIN-T, HMS and CHS-4. In the IT services business, revenues were up as we worked to meet commercial wireless customers accelerated schedules and commenced work on the contact-center services contract discussed above. Revenues decreased in 2013 across the ISR business driven by lower U.S. defense spending and a slower-than-expected transition to related follow-on work. The Information Systems and Technology group operating earnings and margins increased in 2013 driven by the negative impact of four discrete charges in 2012 : 31 $2 billion goodwill impairment resulting from slowed defense spending and the threat of sequestration, coupled with margin compression due to a shift in the group contract mix impacting projected cash flows; $110 of intangible asset impairments on several assets in our optical products business as a result of competitive losses and delays indicative of lower overall demand caused by the economic downturn; $58 write-down of substantially all of the remaining ruggedized hardware inventory based on anticipated remaining demand for products that ceased production in 2012; and $26 for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the U.K. Specialist Vehicle (SV) program. Excluding these charges, operating margins decreased slightly in 2013 primarily due to growth in the lower-margin IT services business and performance challenges in the group U.K. business. Management of the U.K. business was consolidated into our North American mobile communication systems business in 2013. 2015 Outlook We expect 2015 revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to decrease approximately 5.5 percent from 2014 as some of 2014 anticipated revenue reduction flows into 2015. Operating margins are expected to improve again to slightly more than 9 percent. MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2014 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 Variance Revenues $ 7,312 $ 6,712 $ 600 8.9 % Operating earnings 703 666 37 5.6 % Operating margins 9.6 % 9.9 % The increase in the Marine Systems group revenues in 2014 consisted of the following: Navy ship construction $ 444 Navy ship engineering, repair and other services (121 ) Commercial ship construction 277 Total increase $ 600 The group U.S. Navy ship construction programs include Virginia-class submarines, DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyers, and Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) auxiliary support ships. The increase in Navy ship construction revenues in 2014 is primarily due to higher volume on the Virginia-class program, including long-lead materials for the Block IV contract, which was awarded in the second quarter of 2014 . This increase was partially offset by lower volume on the MLP program, as two of the four ships under contract have been delivered. Revenues for Navy engineering, repair and other services decreased in 2014 primarily due to lower spending by the Navy on submarine-related overhaul and repair services. Commercial ship construction revenues increased in 2014 as work ramped up on the group's construction of Jones Act ships. All 10 commercial ships under contract are expected to be at various stages of construction by the end of 2015. Operating margins decreased 30 basis points in 2014 primarily due to a shift in contract mix as work on the Block IV Virginia-class and Jones Act commercial ship contracts ramped up, volume decreased on 32 mature contracts, including MLP and Blocks II and III of the Virginia-class program, and construction progressed on the first of the three DDG-1000 ships and two of the DDG-51 ships in the Navy restart of the program. Review of 2013 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 Variance Revenues $ 6,712 $ 6,592 $ 120 1.8 % Operating earnings 666 750 (84 ) (11.2 )% Operating margins 9.9 % 11.4 % The Marine Systems group revenues increased in 2013 compared with 2012 as lower ship construction revenues were offset by higher revenues from engineering and repair programs for the Navy and commercial ship construction. The decrease in 2013 construction revenues was due to the completion of the T-AKE combat-logistics ship program in late 2012. However, this decrease was partially offset by higher revenues on the Virginia-class program, primarily due to long-lead materials for the Block IV contract. Revenues were higher on Navy engineering and repair programs in 2013 due to increased submarine overhaul and repair work. Commercial ship construction revenues increased as work commenced on contracts for Jones Act ships secured in late 2012 and 2013. Operating earnings and margins decreased in 2013 due to the completion of the mature, higher-margin T-AKE program in 2012. 2015 Outlook We expect the Marine Systems group 2015 revenues to increase 2 to 2.5 percent from 2014 , primarily due to higher revenues on the Virginia-class program. Operating margins are expected to remain in the mid-9 percent range. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options. Corporate operating costs totaled $72 in 2014 , $96 in 2013 and $69 in 2012 . We expect Corporate operating costs in 2015 of approximately $65 to $70. 33 OTHER INFORMATION PRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUES AND OPERATING COSTS Review of 2014 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 Variance Revenues: Products $ 19,564 $ 19,100 $ 464 2.4 % Services 11,288 11,830 (542 ) (4.6 )% Operating Costs: Products $ 15,335 $ 15,065 $ 270 1.8 % Services 9,644 10,137 (493 ) (4.9 )% The increase in product revenues in 2014 consisted of the following: Ship construction $ 626 Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting 619 Mobile communication products (536 ) Pre-owned aircraft (143 ) Other, net (102 ) Total increase $ 464 Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased in 2014 due to additional deliveries of large-cabin aircraft. Ship construction revenues increased due to higher volume on the Virginia-class submarine program and commercial Jones Act ships. Offsetting these increases, lower U.S. Army spending negatively impacted revenues from mobile communication products. Pre-owned aircraft sales were down as there were fewer aircraft trade-ins and resulting sales in 2014. Despite the 2.4 percent increase in product revenues, product operating costs rose only 1.8 percent compared with 2013 due to strong operating performance. The majority of the change in product operating costs was due to volume, although costs in 2014 were affected by other changes, including higher net R&D expenses in the Aerospace group associated with ongoing product-development efforts. No other changes were individually significant. Primary changes due to volume: Ship construction $ 514 Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting 357 Mobile communication products (504 ) Pre-owned aircraft (148 ) 219 Other changes, net 51 Total increase $ 270 The decrease in service revenues in 2014 consisted of the following: 34 Military vehicle services $ (194 ) Mobile communication support services (191 ) IT services (155 ) Other, net (2 ) Total decrease $ (542 ) Military vehicle and mobile communication support services revenues were lower due to decreased U.S. Army spending, while IT services revenues decreased due to reduced commercial wireless work. Service operating costs were lower in 2014 compared with 2013 . As shown below, the decrease in service operating costs was due to lower volume. No other changes were individually significant. Primary changes due to volume: Military vehicle services $ (144 ) Mobile communication support services (200 ) IT services (102 ) (446 ) Other changes, net (47 ) Total decrease $ (493 ) Review of 2013 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 Variance Revenues: Products $ 19,100 $ 19,264 $ (164 ) (0.9 )% Services 11,830 11,728 102 0.9 % Operating Costs: Products $ 15,065 $ 15,830 $ (765 ) (4.8 )% Services 10,137 10,182 (45 ) (0.4 )% The decrease in product revenues in 2013 consisted of the following: Military vehicle production $ (1,218 ) Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting 1,123 Other, net (69 ) Total decrease $ (164 ) In 2013 , military vehicle production revenues decreased on several programs, including the Stryker, Abrams and MRAP programs. Offsetting these decreases, aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased due to additional deliveries of the G650 and G280 aircraft. Product operating costs were lower in 2013 compared with 2012 . Discrete charges totaling $289 in 2012 in the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology business groups included $110 of intangible asset impairments on several assets in our optical products business, $89 related to the termination of a contract to provide Pandur vehicles to the Portuguese government, $58 of ruggedized hardware inventory write-downs for products that ceased production in 2012, and $32 for cost growth associated 35 with the demonstration phase of the SV program for the U.K. Ministry of Defence. Excluding these charges, the decrease in product operating costs was primarily due to lower volume. No other changes were individually significant. Primary changes due to volume: Military vehicle production $ (1,180 ) Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting 864 (316 ) 2012 discrete charges (289 ) Other changes, net (160 ) Total decrease $ (765 ) The increase in service revenues in 2013 consisted of the following: Ship engineering and repair $ 178 Other, net (76 ) Total increase $ 102 Ship engineering and repair revenues increased in 2013 due to submarine overhaul and repair work. Service operating costs were lower in 2013 compared with 2012 . While ship engineering and repair cost volume increased, this was offset by the intangible asset impairment in 2012 in Jet Aviation maintenance business. No other changes were individually significant. Ship engineering and repair volume $ 163 2012 intangible asset impairment (191 ) Other changes, net (17 ) Total decrease $ (45 ) GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT In 2012 , we recorded a $2 billion goodwill impairment in the Information Systems and Technology group discussed in conjunction with the business group operating results. G&A EXPENSES As a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses were 6.4 percent in 2014 , 6.6 percent in 2013 and 7.2 percent in 2012 . We expect G&A expenses in 2015 to be generally consistent with 2014 . INTEREST, NET Net interest expense was $86 in 2014 and 2013 and $156 in 2012 . The decrease in interest expense in 2013 results from our debt refinancing completed in December 2012. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations. We expect full-year 2015 net interest expense to be $82. 36 OTHER, NET In 2012 , other expenses included a $123 loss on the redemption of debt associated with the refinancing discussed above. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX, NET Our effective tax rate was 29.7 percent in 2014 , 31.2 percent in 2013 and 180.5 percent in 2012 . The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2014 was primarily due to increased income from international operations and utilization of foreign tax credits. The atypically high tax rate in 2012 was driven by the largely non-deductible goodwill impairment recorded in the Information Systems and Technology group and, to a lesser extent, the establishment of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in our non-U.S. operations. For further discussion and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We anticipate the full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 30.5 percent in 2015 . DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX In 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our axle business in the Combat Systems group and recognized a $146 loss, net of tax (the sale was completed in January 2015). In 2013, we recognized a $129 loss, net of tax, from the settlement of our litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 contract in the company discontinued tactical military aircraft business. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of these transactions. BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $72.4 billion at the end of 2014 , nearly 60 percent higher than the prior-year amount of $45.9 billion . On December 31, 2014 , our estimated potential contract value was $26.7 billion compared to $27.6 billion at the end of 2013 . Our total estimated contract value, which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value, was $99.1 billion on December 31, 2014 , our highest year-end balance ever. Estimated potential contract value includes work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts. IDIQ contracts provide customers with flexibility when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries 37 or services that will be required at the time the contract is executed. Contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. AEROSPACE Aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers. Unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Aerospace group ended 2014 with backlog of $13.2 billion , compared with $13.9 billion at year-end 2013 . Orders were up more than 15 percent compared to 2013 and included strong demand across our product portfolio. Our backlog included orders for an all-new family of business jets introduced in 2014, the G500 and G600 aircraft, designed to optimize speed, cabin comfort, efficiency and industry-leading safety technologies. The aircraft are expected to enter into service in 2018 and 2019, respectively, following type certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency. Despite strong orders in 2014, the group backlog has declined in recent years as G650 production has ramped up to fulfill the substantial orders we received upon introduction of the aircraft in 2008. We have approximately three years of backlog for the G650. We expect backlog to continue to decrease over the next several years as the time period between customer order and delivery of the G650 aircraft normalizes. At that time, we expect order activity to more closely match deliveries. Estimated potential contract value in the Aerospace group primarily represents options to purchase new aircraft and long-term agreements with fleet customers. Estimated potential contract value of $2.7 billion on December 31, 2014, increased more than 60 percent from $1.7 billion at year-end 2013. The increase is largely due to new multi-aircraft agreements in 2014 that include options for several Gulfstream aircraft models. Demand for Gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions, generating orders from public and private companies, individuals and governments around the world. 38 Geographically, non-U.S. customers represented approximately 60 percent of the group backlog on December 31, 2014 . DEFENSE GROUPS The total backlog in our defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by non-U.S. customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. We have included in total backlog firm contracts at the amounts we believe are likely to receive funding but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program. Total backlog in our defense groups was $59.2 billion on December 31, 2014 , up more than 85 percent from $31.9 billion at the end of 2013 due to major awards received in 2014 in our Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups detailed below. Estimated potential contract value was $23.9 billion on December 31, 2014, compared to $25.9 billion at year-end 2013. COMBAT SYSTEMS Combat Systems total backlog was $19.8 billion at the end of 2014 , tripling the year-end 2013 backlog of $6.6 billion . Growth in the group backlog was primarily due to two major contract awards received in 2014, a $5.9 billion award from the U.K. Ministry of Defence to deliver Specialist Vehicle (SV) platforms to the British Army between 2017 and 2024, and a $10 billion award to provide wheeled armored vehicles, training and support services to an international customer through 2028. The wheeled vehicle contract also provides for an additional potential $3 billion of vehicles and services. The Combat Systems group has several other significant non-U.S. military vehicle production contracts in backlog, including: $515 for light armored vehicles (LAVs) for various international customers, including $230 for the upgrade and modernization of LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army; $130 for Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish Army through 2018; and 39 $110 for the production of Eagle vehicles for Germany and Duro vehicles for Switzerland. The Army Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented $780 of the group backlog on December 31, 2014 , with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2016. The group received $460 of Stryker orders in 2014, including awards for double-V-hulled vehicles, contractor logistics support and engineering services. The group backlog on December 31, 2014 , included $540 for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the Army and U.S. allies around the world, including $105 for M1A2 tanks for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Combat Systems group backlog on December 31, 2014 , also included $2.2 billion for multiple weapons systems and munitions programs. Combat Systems estimated potential contract value was $5.5 billion on December 31, 2014 , up more than 50 percent since year-end 2013 primarily due to the international wheeled vehicle contract discussed previously. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists of thousands of contracts and is reconstituted each year with new programs and task order awards. The group total backlog was $8.6 billion at the end of 2014 , up slightly from $8.5 billion at year-end 2013 . This amount does not include $16.1 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. In 2014, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed nearly $4 billion to the group orders. The group received a number of significant contract awards in 2014 , including the following: $645 to extend the period of performance for support on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP); $210 for the U.K. Bowman tactical communication system for long-term support and capability upgrades; $335 from the Army for ruggedized computing equipment under the CHS-4 program. $655 of estimated potential contract value remains under this IDIQ contract; 40 $165 from Austal USA for combat and seaframe control systems for two Littoral Combat Ships for the U.S. Navy, bringing the value in backlog to $350. Options to provide these naval control systems for two additional ships will be reported in backlog when they are exercised; and $180 from the U.S. Department of State to provide supply chain management services. Backlog at year-end 2014 also included the following key programs: $495 for contact-center services for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, including the 1-800-MEDICARE program; $390 of support and modernization work for the intelligence community, the DoD and the Department of Homeland Security, including the St. Elizabeths campus, New Campus East and NETCENTS infrastructure programs; and $305 for the WIN-T mobile communications network program. The group has an additional $380 of estimated potential contract value associated with this program awarded as an IDIQ contract. MARINE SYSTEMS The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. Backlog increased more than 80 percent from $16.9 billion at the end of 2013 to $30.8 billion on December 31, 2014 . The Virginia-class submarine program was the company largest program in 2014 and the largest contract in the company backlog. In 2014 , we received a contract for the construction of 10 submarines in Block IV of the program. The group backlog at year end included $21 billion for 17 Virginia-class submarines scheduled for delivery through 2023. Navy destroyer programs represented $4.6 billion of the group backlog at year-end 2014. We currently have construction contracts for seven DDG-51 destroyers, including one awarded in 2014, scheduled for delivery through 2022. Backlog at year end also included three ships under the DDG-1000 program scheduled for delivery through 2019 . The Marine Systems group backlog on December 31, 2014 , included $560 for construction of MLP ships. The group has delivered the first two ships in this program, and received a $500 award in 2014 for 41 procurement of a fourth ship. Construction is underway on the two additional ships, scheduled for delivery in 2015 and 2018. The third and fourth ships are configured as Afloat Forward Staging Bases (AFSB). The year-end backlog also included $880 for 10 liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered and LNG-conversion-ready Jones Act ships for commercial customers scheduled for delivery through 2017. Complementing these ship construction programs, engineering services represented approximately $2 billion of the Marine Systems group backlog on December 31, 2014 , including $1.4 billion for design and development efforts on the Ohio-class submarine replacement program. Additionally, year-end backlog for maintenance, repair and other services totaled $1.7 billion. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation. This focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. The $9.4 billion of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and fund capital expenditures. Our net cash position, defined as cash and equivalents and marketable securities less debt, was $1 billion at year-end 2014 , down $415 from the end of 2013 . Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks and commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher. On December 31, 2014 , $1.9 billion of our cash was held by non-U.S. operations. Should this cash be repatriated, it generally would be subject to U.S. federal income tax but would generate offsetting foreign tax credits. Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,728 $ 3,111 $ 2,606 Net cash used by investing activities (1,102 ) (363 ) (642 ) Net cash used by financing activities (3,575 ) (725 ) (1,382 ) Net cash provided (used) by discontinued operations 36 (18 ) 65 Net (decrease) increase in cash and equivalents (913 ) 2,005 647 Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 5,301 3,296 2,649 Cash and equivalents at end of year 4,388 5,301 3,296 Marketable securities 500 Short- and long-term debt (3,911 ) (3,909 ) (3,909 ) Net cash (debt) $ 977 $ 1,392 $ (613 ) Debt-to-equity (a) 33.1 % 27.0 % 34.3 % Debt-to-capital (b) 24.8 % 21.2 % 25.6 % (a) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (b) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8. OPERATING ACTIVITIES We generated cash from operating activities of $3.7 billion in 2014 , $3.1 billion in 2013 and $2.6 billion in 2012 . In all three years, the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings (loss) after removing the impact of non-cash charges. Operating cash flows in 2014 included significant customer deposits related to a large non-U.S. contract awarded in our Combat Systems group. As these deposits are utilized to fund supplier commitments on the program, we expect operating cash flows to be less. Operating cash flows in 42 2013 benefited from reductions in operating working capital, primarily in our Marine Systems group where deposits were received for commercial ship orders. INVESTING ACTIVITIES We used $1.1 billion in 2014 , $363 in 2013 and $642 in 2012 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash for investing activities were capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $521 in 2014 , $436 in 2013 and 2012 . We expect capital expenditures of approximately 2 percent of revenues in 2015 . Marketable Securities. In 2014 , we purchased $500 of short-term held-to-maturity securities. Other net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities in all three years were not material. Other, Net. Investing activities also include proceeds from the sale of assets and cash paid for business acquisitions. We completed one acquisition in 2014, no acquisitions in 2013 and seven acquisitions in 2012 for $444. We used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of acquisition activity. FINANCING ACTIVITIES We used $3.6 billion in 2014 , $725 in 2013 and $1.4 billion in 2012 for financing activities. Our financing activities include repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends and debt issuances and repayments. Net cash from financing activities also included proceeds received from stock option exercises. Share Repurchases. We repurchased 29 million of our outstanding shares in 2014 (11.4 million of the shares were repurchased under an accelerated share repurchase program), 9.4 million shares in 2013 and 9.1 million shares in 2012 . As a result, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 7 percent since the end of 2011. On December 31, 2014 , 2.4 million shares remain authorized by our board of directors for repurchase, less than 1 percent of our total shares outstanding. Dividends. On March 5, 2014 , our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share, the 17 th consecutive annual increase. Previously, the board had increased the quarterly dividend to $0.56 per share in March 2013 and $0.51 per share in March 2012 . We did not pay any dividends in the first three months of 2013 because we made our first quarter dividend payment in December 2012. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2012 , we issued $2.4 billion of fixed-rate notes and used the proceeds to redeem, prior to maturity, an equal amount of fixed-rate notes with higher interest rates. In January 2015, we repaid $500 of fixed-rate notes on their scheduled maturity date with the proceeds from maturing marketable securities purchased in 2014 (see discussion above). We have no additional material repayments of long-term debt scheduled until 2016. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates. We ended 2014 with no commercial paper outstanding. We have $2 billion in bank credit facilities that remain available, including a $1 billion facility expiring in July 2016 and a $1 billion facility expiring in July 2018 . These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. 43 NON-GAAP MANAGEMENT METRICS We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe these metrics provide useful information, they are not defined operating measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other GAAP measures. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for shareholders because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,728 $ 3,111 $ 2,606 $ 3,150 $ 2,946 Capital expenditures (521 ) (436 ) (436 ) (445 ) (351 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 3,207 $ 2,675 $ 2,170 $ 2,705 $ 2,595 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 139 % 125 % NM* 126 % 115 % Free cash flow from operations 120 % 108 % NM* 108 % 101 % * Not meaningful (NM) due to net loss in 2012. Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for shareholders because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year. ROIC excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss, goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of our operating performance. Prior-year amounts have been adjusted for comparative purposes to reflect our current definition. ROIC is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012* 2011 2010 Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,673 $ 2,486 $ 1,414 $ 2,500 $ 2,567 After-tax interest expense 67 67 109 101 109 After-tax amortization expense 79 93 139 141 135 Net operating profit after taxes $ 2,819 $ 2,646 $ 1,662 $ 2,742 $ 2,811 Average invested capital $ 18,692 $ 18,764 $ 19,899 $ 18,608 $ 17,844 Return on invested capital 15.1 % 14.1 % 8.4 % 14.7 % 15.8 % *2012 loss from continuing operations of ($381) has been adjusted for $1,994 goodwill impairment and associated $199 tax benefit. 2012 shareholders equity, a component of average invested capital, has been similarly adjusted. 44 ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS On December 31, 2014 , other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on December 31, 2014 : Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,771 $ 586 $ 1,549 $ 122 $ 2,514 Capital lease obligations 31 2 4 4 21 Operating leases 1,078 210 313 172 383 Purchase obligations (b) 31,121 9,482 12,090 5,757 3,792 Other long-term liabilities (c) 19,358 3,554 2,330 1,705 11,769 $ 56,359 $ 13,834 $ 16,286 $ 7,760 $ 18,479 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of long-term debt. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $24.6 billion of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the current portion of these liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management estimates, which are based largely on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under our defined-benefit retirement plans. See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our long-term contracts and programs. Other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, and litigation and other contingencies. We employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from 45 these estimates. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. We determine progress using either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. An input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion (input measure). For our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft, we record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft (output measure). We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. We include in our contract estimates additional revenues for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance. These estimates are based on our best judgment at the time. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review our performance monthly and update our contract-related estimates at least annually and often quarterly, as well as when required by specific events and circumstances. We recognize changes in the estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method. Under this method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term. We use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our long-term contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods. These changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned. Most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catch-up method. The impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catch-up method. The net increase in our operating 46 earnings (and on a per-share basis) from the impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled favorable changes in estimate of $184 ( $0.35 ) in 2014 , $351 ( $0.65 ) in 2013 and $180 ( $0.33 ) in 2012 . The 2013 impact of changes in estimate was higher as a result of numerous programs that neared completion in the Combat Systems group. No revisions on any one contract were material to our Consolidated Financial Statements in 2014 . In the second quarter of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 prescribes a single, common revenue standard that replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The standard outlines a five-step model, whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is effective in the first quarter of 2017. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The required adoption of the ASU in 2017 will preclude our use of the reallocation method of recognizing revisions in estimated profit on contracts discussed above. As changes in estimated profit will be recognized in the period they are identified (cumulative catch-up method), rather than prospectively over the remaining contract term, we expect that the impact of revisions of contract estimates may be larger and potentially more variable from period to period. Anticipated losses on contracts will continue to be recognized in the quarter they are identified. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows, and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows. Due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis. To assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows, we compare the sum of our reporting units fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization). We evaluate the reasonableness of this control premium by comparing it to control premiums for recent comparable market transactions. We completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2014 . The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are consistent with our business groups. The estimated fair values for each of our reporting units were well in excess of their respective carrying values as of December 31, 2014 . In our Information Systems and Technology reporting unit (for which we recorded a $2 billion goodwill impairment in 2012 ), this excess increased from 2013 as there was an improvement in the fair value and a decrease in the carrying value of the reporting unit. 47 We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, where identified, are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not allocable currently to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions include interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. In 2014 , we adopted updated mortality tables published by the Society of Actuaries that predict increasing life expectancies in the United States. Additionally, we updated several other assumptions to align them with historical experience, including rates of retirement and cost of living increases. The impact of these changes was a net increase of $566 and $28 in the benefit obligations of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, respectively, on December 31, 2014 . These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event any of the assumptions change, pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For further discussion, including the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings. 48
