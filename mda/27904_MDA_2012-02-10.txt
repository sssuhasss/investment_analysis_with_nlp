ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Highlights - 2011 Compared to 2010 Our net income for 2011 was $854 million , or $1.01 per diluted share. This is $261 million higher than 2010 despite significantly higher fuel costs. Total operating revenue increased $3.4 billion , on an 11% increase in passenger mile yield, primarily due to higher passenger revenues as we were able to adjust ticket prices in response to higher fuel prices. Total operating expense was up $3.6 billion , or 12% , driven primarily by a $2.9 billion increase in fuel expense (including our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements). Fuel price volatility continues to represent a significant risk to our business and the airline industry as a whole. Our fuel cost per gallon increased 31% from 2010 to 2011 . During 2011 , fuel expense, including amounts under contract carrier agreements, increased by $2.9 billion and now represents 36% of total operating expense. During 2011 , gains from our hedging program reduced fuel expense by $420 million . Including fuel hedge activity, our average price per fuel gallon in 2011 was $3.06 as compared to $2.33 in 2010 . Our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile ("CASM") for 2011 increased to 14.12 cents compared to 12.69 cents in 2010 , primarily reflecting higher fuel prices. For 2011 , CASM-Ex (a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in "Supplemental Information" below) was 8.53 cents, or 3% higher than 2010 , primarily reflecting higher revenue-related expenses and salaries and related costs. During 2011 , we reduced our total debt and capital leases by $1.5 billion and ended the year with $5.4 billion in unrestricted liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and availability under credit facilities. Fleet Strategy During 2011, we entered into an agreement with The Boeing Company ("Boeing") to purchase 100 B-737-900ER aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2018. We have obtained committed long-term financing for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft. The Boeing agreement and our plans to bring into service 30 to 40 previously owned MD-90 aircraft over the next two to three years will enable us to replace on a capacity-neutral basis older, less efficient aircraft scheduled to be retired. The majority of the MD-90 aircraft scheduled to come into service over the next two to three years were purchased or leased in 2010 and 2011. These B-737-900ER and MD-90 aircraft will have lower unit costs than the aircraft they are replacing as a result of lower maintenance costs and fuel efficiencies. In addition to lowering unit costs, we are also investing in our fleet to enhance the customer experience. The state-of-the-art B-737-900ER will offer an industry leading customer experience, including expanded carry-on baggage space and a roomier cabin. By the end of 2013, our entire widebody international fleet will be updated with full flat-bed seats in BusinessElite. We completed the installation of full flat-bed seats in the BusinessElite cabin of our B-777 and B-767-400ER aircraft during 2011. Due to the success of our Economy Comfort product, which we began offering during the 2011 summer on long-haul international flights, we are expanding Economy Comfort throughout our mainline and regional fleet by the summer of 2012. We have also been investing in our domestic and regional fleet, with in-flight WiFi on all two-class domestic aircraft, interior upgrades and the installation of additional First Class seating. New York Strategy Strengthening our position in New York City is an important part of our network strategy. As discussed below, key components of this strategy are operating a domestic hub at New York's LaGuardia Airport ("LaGuardia") and creating a state-of-the-art facility at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport ("JFK"). LaGuardia. During December 2011, we closed the transactions contemplated under an agreement with US Airways including the exchange of takeoff and landing rights (each a "slot pair") at LaGuardia and Reagan National airports, which will allow us to operate a new domestic hub at LaGuardia. Under the agreement, (1) Delta acquired 132 slot pairs at LaGuardia from US Airways and (2) US Airways acquired from Delta 42 slot pairs at Reagan National; the rights to operate additional daily service to S o Paulo, Brazil in 2015; and $66.5 million in cash. Additionally, Delta divested 16 slot pairs at LaGuardia and eight slot pairs at Reagan National to airlines with limited or no service at those airports. 26 Following the closing of the transaction, we announced the expansion of our service at LaGuardia in 2012 to include more than 100 new flights and 29 new destinations. Our expanded schedule will add nonstop service to top U.S. business markets and additional frequencies to business markets currently served. As part of the expansion, we are also investing $100 million to create an expanded main terminal at LaGuardia in Terminals C and D and will build a bridge to link the two terminals. JFK. While our expanded LaGuardia schedule is focused on providing industry-leading domestic service, our schedule at JFK is being optimized in 2012 for international and trans-continental flights, as well as improved coordination with our SkyTeam alliance partners. At JFK, we currently operate domestic flights primarily at Terminal 2 and international flights at Terminal 3 and, to a lesser extent, Terminal 4. Our redevelopment project at JFK, which began in 2010, currently includes the (1) enhancement and expansion of Terminal 4, including the construction of nine new international gates; (2) construction of a passenger connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 4; (3) demolition of the outdated Terminal 3, which was constructed in 1960; and (4) development of the Terminal 3 site for aircraft parking positions. We estimate this project will cost approximately $1.2 billion and will be completed in stages over five years. Construction at Terminal 4 has commenced and is scheduled to be completed in 2013. Upon completion of the Terminal 4 expansion, we will relocate our operations from Terminal 3 to Terminal 4, proceed with the demolition of Terminal 3, and thereafter conduct coordinated flight operations from Terminals 2 and 4. Once our project is complete, we expect that passengers will benefit from an enhanced customer experience and improved operational performance, including reduced taxi times and better on-time performance. 27 Results of Operations - 2011 Compared to 2010 Operating Revenue Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2011 2010 Passenger: Mainline $ 23,864 $ 21,408 $ 2,456 11 % Regional carriers 6,393 5,850 543 9 % Total passenger revenue 30,257 27,258 2,999 11 % Cargo 1,027 850 177 21 % Other 3,831 3,647 184 5 % Total operating revenue $ 35,115 $ 31,755 $ 3,360 11 % Increase (Decrease) vs. Year Ended December 31, 2010 (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2011 Passenger Revenue RPMs (Traffic) ASMs (Capacity) Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Domestic $ 13,129 11 % % (1 )% 11 % 11 % 0.4 pts Atlantic 5,590 9 % (1 )% 2 % 10 % 7 % (2.1 ) pts Pacific 3,368 20 % 4 % 10 % 15 % 9 % (4.7 ) pts Latin America 1,777 13 % % % 13 % 13 % (0.6 ) pts Total mainline 23,864 11 % % 1 % 11 % 10 % (1.0 ) pts Regional carriers 6,393 9 % (2 )% (2 )% 12 % 12 % 0.1 pts Total passenger revenue $ 30,257 11 % % 1 % 11 % 10 % (0.9 ) pts Mainline Passenger Revenue. Mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to an improvement in the passenger mile yield from fare increases implemented in response to higher fuel prices and from higher revenue under corporate travel contracts. Domestic . Domestic mainline passenger revenue increased 11% due to an 11% improvement in PRASM on a 1% decline in capacity. The improvement in PRASM reflects higher passenger mile yield driven by fare increases. International . International mainline passenger revenue increased 13% due to a 9% improvement in PRASM on a 4% capacity increase. Passenger mile yield increased 12% , reflecting increased business and leisure travel and increased fares, including fuel surcharges. Atlantic passenger revenue increased 9% due to a 7% increase in PRASM. We and the industry faced overcapacity in the Atlantic, particularly in early 2011, which prevented us from increasing ticket prices sufficiently to cover higher fuel prices. Pacific passenger revenue increased 20% on a 10% capacity increase. Pacific passenger mile yield increased 15% due to a stronger revenue environment, partially offset by the negative impact from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Latin America passenger revenue increased 13% , benefiting from a 13% higher passenger mile yield driven by fare increases. Regional carriers . Passenger revenue from regional carriers increased 9% due to an 12% improvement in PRASM on a 2% decline in capacity. Passenger mile yield increased 12% , reflecting fare increases we implemented in response to increased fuel prices. Cargo . Cargo revenue increased 21% due to a 12% improvement in yield and an 8% increase in volume. Other. Other revenue increased $210 million due to higher maintenance sales to third parties by our MRO services business and $65 million due to an increase in the volume of ticket change fees. These increases were partially offset by $90 million in lower baggage fee revenue, resulting from an increase in bag fees waived for premium customers and customers under our co-brand credit card agreement with American Express. 28 Operating Expense Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2011 2010 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 9,730 $ 7,594 $ 2,136 28 % Salaries and related costs 6,894 6,751 143 2 % Contract carrier arrangements 5,470 4,305 1,165 27 % Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 1,765 1,569 196 12 % Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 1,682 1,509 173 11 % Contracted services 1,642 1,549 93 6 % Depreciation and amortization 1,523 1,511 12 1 % Landing fees and other rents 1,281 1,281 % Passenger service 721 673 48 7 % Aircraft rent 298 387 (89 ) (23 )% Profit sharing 264 313 (49 ) (16 )% Restructuring and other items 242 450 (208 ) (46 )% Other 1,628 1,646 (18 ) (1 )% Total operating expense $ 33,140 $ 29,538 $ 3,602 12 % On July 1, 2010, we sold Compass and Mesaba, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, to Trans States and Pinnacle, respectively. Upon the closing of these transactions, we entered into new or amended long-term capacity purchase agreements with Compass, Mesaba and Pinnacle. Prior to these sales, expenses related to Compass and Mesaba as our wholly-owned subsidiaries were reported in the applicable expense line items. Subsequent to these sales, expenses related to Compass and Mesaba are reported as contract carrier arrangements expense. Fuel Expense. Including contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements, fuel expense increased $2.9 billion on flat consumption. The table below presents fuel expense, gallons consumed, and our average price per fuel gallon, including the impact of fuel hedge activity: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions, except per gallon data) 2011 2010 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 9,730 $ 7,594 $ 2,136 Aircraft fuel and related taxes included within contract carrier arrangements 2,053 1,307 746 Total fuel expense $ 11,783 $ 8,901 $ 2,882 32 % Total fuel consumption (gallons) 3,856 3,823 33 1 % Average price per fuel gallon $ 3.06 $ 2.33 $ 0.73 31 % Fuel expense increased primarily due to higher unhedged fuel prices, partially offset by an improvement in net fuel hedge results. The table below shows the impact of hedging on fuel expense and average price per fuel gallon: Average Price Per Gallon Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (in millions, except per gallon data) 2011 2010 2011 2010 Fuel purchase cost $ 12,203 $ 8,812 $ 3,391 $ 3.17 $ 2.31 $ 0.86 Fuel hedge (gains) losses (420 ) 89 (509 ) (0.11 ) 0.02 (0.13 ) Total fuel expense $ 11,783 $ 8,901 $ 2,882 $ 3.06 $ 2.33 $ 0.73 Mark-to-market adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period (26 ) (26 ) (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Total fuel expense, adjusted $ 11,757 $ 8,901 $ 2,856 $ 3.05 $ 2.33 $ 0.72 29 Our average price per fuel gallon, adjusted for mark-to-market adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period (a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in "Supplemental Information" below) was $3.05 for the year ended December 31, 2011. During 2011, our net fuel hedge gains of $420 million included $26 million in gains for mark-to-market adjustments recorded in periods other than the settlement period. These mark-to-market adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period. Such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future cash value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Therefore, Delta adjusts fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost. Salaries and related costs. Salaries and related costs increased due to a 3% average increase in headcount and employee pay increases, partially offset by the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving Compass and Mesaba. Contract carrier arrangements . Contract carrier arrangements expense, excluding the impact of fuel expense (discussed above), increased primarily due to the change in reporting for the transactions involving Compass and Mesaba. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased primarily due to costs associated with increased maintenance sales to third parties by our MRO services business, reflected in other revenue above. Passenger commissions and other selling expenses. Credit card and sales commissions increased in conjunction with the 11% increase in passenger revenue. Aircraft rent. Aircraft rent decreased primarily due to the restructuring of certain existing leases and the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving Compass and Mesaba. Restructuring and other items. Due to the nature of amounts recorded within restructuring and other items, a year over year comparison is not meaningful. For a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items, see Note 15 to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Results of Operations - 2010 Compared to 2009 Operating Revenue Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2010 2009 Passenger: Mainline $ 21,408 $ 18,522 $ 2,886 16 % Regional carriers 5,850 5,285 565 11 % Total passenger revenue 27,258 23,807 3,451 14 % Cargo 850 788 62 8 % Other 3,647 3,468 179 5 % Total operating revenue $ 31,755 $ 28,063 $ 3,692 13 % Increase (Decrease) vs. Year Ended December 31, 2009 (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2010 Passenger Revenue RPMs (Traffic) ASMs (Capacity) Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Domestic $ 11,878 11 % 1 % 2 % 9 % 9 % (0.3 ) pts Atlantic 5,152 18 % % (3 )% 18 % 21 % 2.3 pts Pacific 2,806 38 % 14 % 9 % 21 % 26 % 7.3 pts Latin America 1,572 13 % 4 % 3 % 8 % 10 % 1.0 pts Total mainline 21,408 16 % 3 % 2 % 12 % 14 % 1.0 pts Regional carriers 5,850 11 % (1 )% (2 )% 12 % 13 % 1.0 pts Total passenger revenue $ 27,258 14 % 2 % 1 % 12 % 13 % 1.0 pts Mainline Passenger Revenue. Mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to increased business demand for air travel and an increase in fares, largely due to the strengthening of the airline industry revenue environment. During 2009, weakened demand for air travel from the global recession and the effects of the H1N1 virus and related capacity reductions had a significant negative impact on our mainline passenger revenue. Domestic Passenger Revenue . Domestic passenger revenue increased 11% from a 9% increase in PRASM on a 0.3 point decrease in load factor and a 2% increase in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 9%, reflecting an increase in business travel and an increase in fares. International Passenger Revenue . International passenger revenue increased 22% from a 21% increase in PRASM and a 2.4 point increase in load factor on a 1% increase in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 17%, reflecting an increase in demand for air travel and an increase in fares. Regional carriers . Passenger revenue of regional carriers increased 11% from a 13% increase in PRASM and a 1.0 point increase in load factor on a 2% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 12%, reflecting an increase in demand for air travel and an increase in fares. Cargo . Cargo revenue increased due to a 13% increase in yield and a 25% increase in volume, primarily in international markets, partially offset by capacity reductions due to the retirement of our dedicated freighter aircraft in 2009. Other . Other revenue increased due to higher baggage fee revenue from an increased volume of checked bags. 31 Operating Expense Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2010 2009 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 7,594 $ 7,384 $ 210 3 % Salaries and related costs 6,751 6,838 (87 ) (1 )% Contract carrier arrangements 4,305 3,823 482 13 % Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 1,569 1,434 135 9 % Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 1,509 1,405 104 7 % Contracted services 1,549 1,595 (46 ) (3 )% Depreciation and amortization 1,511 1,536 (25 ) (2 )% Landing fees and other rents 1,281 1,289 (8 ) (1 )% Passenger service 673 638 35 5 % Aircraft rent 387 480 (93 ) (19 )% Profit sharing 313 313 NM (1) Restructuring and other items 450 407 43 11 % Other 1,646 1,558 88 6 % Total operating expense $ 29,538 $ 28,387 $ 1,151 4 % (1) NM - not meaningful On July 1, 2010, we sold Compass and Mesaba, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, to Trans States and Pinnacle, respectively. Upon the closing of these transactions, we entered into new or amended long-term capacity purchase agreements with Compass, Mesaba and Pinnacle. Prior to these sales, expenses related to Compass and Mesaba as our wholly-owned subsidiaries were reported in the applicable expense line items. Subsequent to these sales, expenses related to Compass and Mesaba are reported as contract carrier arrangements expense. Fuel Expense . Including contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements, fuel expense increased $610 million on flat consumption. The table below presents fuel expense, gallons consumed, and our average price per fuel gallon, including the impact of fuel hedge activity: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions, except per gallon data) 2010 2009 Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 7,594 $ 7,384 $ 210 Aircraft fuel and related taxes included within contract carrier arrangements 1,307 907 400 Total fuel expense $ 8,901 $ 8,291 $ 610 7 % Total fuel consumption (gallons) 3,823 3,853 (30 ) (1 )% Average price per fuel gallon $ 2.33 $ 2.15 $ 0.18 8 % Fuel expense increased primarily due to higher unhedged fuel prices, partially offset by an improvement in net fuel hedge results. Fuel hedge losses in 2009 were primarily due to hedge contracts purchased in 2008 when fuel prices reached record highs and were expected to continue to rise, but instead declined. The table below shows the impact of hedging on fuel expense and average price per fuel gallon: Average Price Per Gallon Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (in millions, except per gallon data) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Fuel purchase cost $ 8,812 $ 6,932 $ 1,880 $ 2.31 $ 1.80 $ 0.51 Fuel hedge (gains) losses 89 1,359 (1,270 ) 0.02 0.35 (0.33 ) Total fuel expense $ 8,901 $ 8,291 $ 610 $ 2.33 $ 2.15 $ 0.18 32 Contract carrier arrangements . Contract carrier arrangements expense, excluding the impact of fuel expense (discussed above), increased primarily due to the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving Compass and Mesaba. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased primarily due to returning aircraft to service after temporary storage, as well as the timing of engine and airframe maintenance volumes. Passenger commissions and other selling expenses. Passenger commissions and other selling expenses increased primarily due to higher revenue-related expenses, such as booking fees and sales commissions, from the increase in revenue. Profit sharing. We recorded $313 million related to our broad-based employee profit sharing plans for 2010. We did not record any profit sharing expense in 2009. Our broad-based profit sharing plans provide that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit (as defined in the plan document), we will pay a specified portion of that profit to eligible employees. Restructuring and other items. Due to the nature of amounts recorded within restructuring and other items, a year over year comparison is not meaningful. For a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other items, see Note 15 to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

These debt discounts are a result of fair value adjustments recorded in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of our long-term debt due to purchase accounting and a $1.0 billion advance purchase of SkyMiles by American Express. As a result of these write-offs and scheduled amortization, our unamortized debt discount has decreased from $1.9 billion at the beginning of 2009 to $737 million at December 31, 2011 and our amortization of debt discount, net has decreased significantly from 2009 to 2011. The table below shows the changes in miscellaneous, net: Favorable (Unfavorable) (in millions) 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Mark-to-market adjustments on the ineffective portion of fuel hedge contracts $ (6 ) $ (61 ) Foreign currency exchange rates 3 (52 ) Other (8 ) 3 Miscellaneous, net $ (11 ) $ (110 ) Income Taxes We consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations. During the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , we did not record an income tax provision for U.S. federal income tax purposes since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance. The following table shows the components of our income tax benefit (provision): 33 Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 International and state income tax (provision) benefit $ (7 ) $ (15 ) $ 23 Deferred tax benefit 2 Alternative minimum tax refunds and other 90 Intraperiod income tax allocation 321 Income tax benefit (provision) $ 85 $ (15 ) $ 344 During 2011, we recorded an income tax benefit of $85 million , primarily related to the recognition of alternative minimum tax refunds. During 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $344 million , including a non-cash income tax benefit of $321 million on the loss from continuing operations, with an offsetting non-cash income tax expense of $321 million on other comprehensive income. This deferred income tax expense of $321 million will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss until all amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss that relate to fuel derivatives which are designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. All amounts relating to our fuel derivative contracts that were previously designated as accounting hedges will be recognized by June 2012 (original settlement date of those contracts). As a result, a non-cash income tax expense of $321 million will be recognized in the June 2012 quarter unless we enter into and designate additional fuel derivative contracts as accounting hedges prior to June 2012. At December 31, 2011 , we had $16.8 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years. Our U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2022 . Financial Condition and Liquidity We expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2011 , we had $5.4 billion in unrestricted liquidity, consisting of $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and $1.8 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. Debt and Capital Leases. At December 31, 2011 , total debt and capital leases, including current maturities, was $13.8 billion , a $1.5 billion reduction from December 31, 2010 and a $3.4 billion reduction from December 31, 2009. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by the fact that a significant portion of our assets are subject to liens. Pension Obligations. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals. Our funding obligations for these plans are generally governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. We contributed $598 million and $728 million to our defined benefit pension plans during 2011 and 2010, respectively. We estimate the funding requirements under these plans will total approximately $700 million in 2012. Advance Purchase of SkyMiles. In 2008, we entered into a multi-year extension of our American Express agreements and received $1.0 billion from American Express for an advance purchase of SkyMiles (the "prepayment"). The 2008 agreement provided that our obligations with respect to the advance purchase would be satisfied as American Express uses the purchased miles over a specified future period ( SkyMiles Usage Period ), rather than by cash payments from us to American Express. Due to the SkyMiles Usage Period and other restrictions placed upon American Express regarding the timing and use of the SkyMiles, we classified the $1.0 billion we received, the pre-payment, as long-term debt. During the SkyMiles Usage Period, which commenced during the December 2011 quarter, American Express will draw down on their prepayment instead of paying cash to Delta for SkyMiles used. As of December 31, 2011, $952 million of the original $1.0 billion debt (or prepayment) remained, including $333 million which is classified in current maturities of long-term debt and capital leases. 34 Annual Sale of SkyMiles. In December 2011, we amended our American Express agreements and sold American Express $675 million of SkyMiles. Under the December 2011 amendment, we anticipate American Express will make additional purchases of $675 million of SkyMiles in each of 2012, 2013, and 2014. Fuel Card Obligation . In December 2011, we also obtained a purchasing card with American Express for the purpose of buying jet fuel. The card currently carries a maximum credit limit of $612 million and must be paid monthly. As of December 31, 2011, we had $318 million outstanding on this purchasing card, which was classified as other accrued liabilities. Liquidity Events Liquidity and financing events during 2011 included the following: Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We entered into senior secured first-lien credit facilities (the "Senior Secured Credit Facilities") to borrow up to $2.6 billion. We borrowed $1.4 billion under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to retire $1.4 billion of outstanding loans under our $2.5 billion senior secured exit financing facilities and terminated those facilities and an existing $100 million revolving credit facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR (subject to a 1.25% floor) or another index rate, in each case plus a specified margin and have final maturities in April 2016 and 2017. At December 31, 2011 , the outstanding balances under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities had an interest rate of 5.50% per annum. Pacific Routes Term Loan Facility. We amended our $250 million first-lien term loan facility (the "Pacific Routes Term Loan Facility") to, among other things, reduce the interest rate and extend the maturity date from September 2013 to March 2016. At December 31, 2011 , the Pacific Routes Term Loan Facility had an interest rate of 4.25% per annum. Certificates. We received $834 million in proceeds from offerings of Pass-Through Trust Certificates ("EETC") and used the proceeds to refinance aircraft securing other debt instruments at their maturities, primarily the 2001-1 EETC, and for general corporate purposes. During 2011, we paid $789 million to retire the outstanding principal amount under the 2001-1 EETC. Sources and Uses of Cash Cash Flows From Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.8 billion for 2011, primarily reflecting (1) $2.7 billion in net income after adjusting for items such as depreciation and amortization and (2) $675 million received for the sale of SkyMiles. Cash provided by operating activities was reduced by $313 million in profit sharing payments related to 2010 and other working capital changes. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.8 billion for 2010, primarily reflecting (1) $2.6 billion in net income after adjusting for items such as depreciation and amortization, (2) a $516 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily related to our broad-based employee profit sharing plans and increased operations due to the improving economy and (3) a $232 million increase in advance ticket sales primarily due to an increase in air fares. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was partially offset by a $345 million decrease in frequent flyer liability. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.4 billion for 2009, primarily reflecting the return from counterparties of $1.1 billion of hedge margin primarily used to settle hedge losses recognized during the period and $690 million in net income after adjusting for items such as depreciation and amortization. Cash Flows From Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.5 billion for 2011, primarily reflecting investments of (1) $907 million for flight equipment, including aircraft modifications to invest in full flat bed seats in BusinessElite and in-seat audio and video entertainment systems, parts and advance deposits related to our order to purchase 100 B-737-900ER aircraft, (2) $347 million for ground property and equipment (3) $240 million in net purchases of short-term investments and (4) a $100 million investment in GOL. Included in flight equipment acquisitions are 12 previously owned MD-90 aircraft and one previously leased B-767-300 aircraft. 35 Cash used in investing activities totaled $2.0 billion for 2010, primarily reflecting investments of (1) $1.1 billion for flight equipment, including aircraft modifications and parts, (2) $287 million for ground property and equipment and (3) $815 million for purchases of investments. Flight equipment acquisitions include the purchase of 34 aircraft, four of which were purchased new from the manufacturer, 18 of which were previously leased and 12 of which were previously owned. Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.0 billion for 2009, primarily reflecting net investments of $951 million for flight equipment and $251 million for ground property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a distribution of our investment in a money market fund that was liquidated in an orderly manner in 2010 and proceeds from the sale of flight equipment. Cash Flows From Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.6 billion for 2011, reflecting the repayment of $2.8 billion in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, partially offset by $1.0 billion in proceeds from aircraft and other aircraft-related financing and $318 million from the use of our fuel card. We also refinanced our $2.5 billion senior secured exit financing facilities as discussed above. Cash used in financing activities totaled $2.5 billion for 2010, reflecting the repayment of $3.7 billion in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including the repayment of $914 million of our Exit Revolving Facility. Cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $1.1 billion in proceeds from EETC aircraft financing. Cash used in financing activities totaled $19 million for 2009, primarily reflecting $3.0 billion in proceeds from long-term debt and aircraft financing, largely associated with the issuance of (1) $2.1 billion under three new financings, which included (a) $750 million of senior secured credit facilities, (b) $750 million of senior secured notes, and (c) $600 million of senior second lien notes, (2) $342 million from the 2009-1 EETC offering and (3) $150 million of tax exempt bonds, mostly offset by the repayment of $2.9 billion in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including the Northwest senior secured exit financing facility and a $500 million revolving facility. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 that we expect will be paid in cash. The table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, including legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements, among others. In addition, the table does not include expected significant cash payments which are generally ordinary course of business obligations that do not include contractual commitments. The amounts presented are based on various estimates, including estimates regarding the timing of payments, prevailing interest rates, volumes purchased, the occurrence of certain events and other factors. Accordingly, the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table. During 2011, our contractual obligations were impacted by our agreement with Boeing to purchase 100 B-737-900ER aircraft with deliveries beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2018. Our estimated payments to purchase these aircraft are included in aircraft purchase obligations below. Contractual Obligations by Year (1) (in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (see Note 7) Principal amount $ 1,592 $ 1,225 $ 2,000 $ 1,347 $ 1,240 $ 5,441 $ 12,845 Interest payments 710 630 560 410 320 800 3,430 Contract carrier obligations (see Note 9) 2,340 2,420 2,430 2,400 2,100 5,700 17,390 Operating lease payments (see Note 8) 1,462 1,441 1,380 1,271 1,126 7,588 14,268 Employee benefit obligations (see Note 10) 830 790 800 810 780 10,920 14,930 Aircraft purchase commitments (see Note 9) 215 530 745 760 760 3,810 6,820 Capital lease obligations (see Note 8) 221 196 168 155 163 323 1,226 Other obligations 510 230 210 120 70 170 1,310 Total $ 7,880 $ 7,462 $ 8,293 $ 7,273 $ 6,559 $ 34,752 $ 72,219 (1) For additional information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referenced in the table above. 36 Long-Term Debt, Principal Amount. Represents scheduled principal payments on long-term debt. The table excludes amounts received from American Express for its advance purchase of SkyMiles because this obligation will be satisfied by American Express' use of SkyMiles over a specified period rather than by cash payments from us. For additional information about our agreements with American Express, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-Term Debt, Interest Payments. Represents estimated interest payments under our long-term debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements. Interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using LIBOR at December 31, 2011 . Contract Carrier Obligations. Represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with regional carriers (excluding Comair). The reported amounts are based on (1) the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and (2) assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying. Employee Benefit Obligations. Represents primarily (1) our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and (2) projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans. For additional information about our employee benefit obligations, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates . Aircraft Purchase Commitments. Represents primarily our commitments to purchase 100 B-737-900ER aircraft, 18 B-787-8 aircraft and nine previously owned MD-90 aircraft. Other Obligations. Represents primarily estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including but not limited to insurance, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third party services and products. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the actual results may differ materially from these estimates. For a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Frequent Flyer Program Our frequent flyer program (the SkyMiles Program ) offers incentives to travel on Delta. This program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements and airlines that participate in the SkyMiles Program, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage credits to non-airline businesses, customers and other airlines. The SkyMiles Program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. As discussed below, these are (1) passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and (2) the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements. Mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on Delta and participating airlines, membership in our Sky Club and other program awards. Passenger Ticket Sales Earning Mileage Credits. Passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our SkyMiles Program provide customers with two deliverables: (1) mileage credits earned and (2) air transportation. Effective January 1, 2011, we began applying the provisions of Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables ("ASU 2009-13") to passenger tickets earning mileage credits. Under ASU 2009-13, we value each deliverable on a standalone basis. Our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers and is re-evaluated at least annually. We use established ticket prices to determine the standalone selling price of air transportation. We allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices. 37 We defer revenue from the mileage credit component of passenger ticket sales and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided. We record the portion of the passenger ticket sales for air transportation in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition or its classification with regard to passenger tickets earning mileage credits. A hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately $50 million, as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13, we used the residual method for revenue recognition. Under the residual method, we determined the fair value of the mileage credit component based on prices at which we sold mileage credits to other airlines and then considered the remainder of the amount collected to be the air transportation deliverable. Sale of Mileage Credits. Customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits. Our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have two deliverables: (1) the mileage credits redeemable for future travel and (2) the marketing component. ASU 2009-13 does not apply to contracts to sell mileage credits entered into prior to January 1, 2011 unless those contracts are materially modified. As of December 31, 2011, we had not materially modified any of our significant agreements. Our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. For additional information about this relationship, see Note 6. For contracts entered into prior to January 1, 2011 that have not been materially modified since January 1, 2011, we continue to use the residual method for revenue recognition and value only the mileage credits. Under the residual method, the portion of the revenue from the mileage component is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided. The portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value of mileage credits sold, the marketing component, is recognized in income as other revenue when the related marketing services are provided. The fair value of a mileage credit is determined based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines and is re-evaluated at least annually. If we enter into new contracts or materially modify existing contracts to sell mileage credits related to our SkyMiles Program, we will value the standalone selling price of the marketing component and allocate the revenue from the contract based on the relative selling price of the mileage credits and the marketing component. A material modification of an existing contract could impact our deferral rate or cause an adjustment to our deferred revenue balance, which could materially impact our future financial results. Breakage. For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed ( Breakage ), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. The estimate of Breakage is based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. At December 31, 2011 , the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles Program was $4.5 billion . A hypothetical 1% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $31 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at December 31, 2011 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of October 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. In September 2011, the FASB issued "Testing Goodwill for Impairment." The standard revises the way in which entities test goodwill for impairment. We adopted this standard and applied its provisions to our annual goodwill impairment test in the December 2011 quarter. Key Assumptions. The key assumptions in our impairment tests include (1) our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (3) assumed discount rates depending on the asset and (4) a tax rate. These assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use. Since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates. 38 Changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in impairment. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of the weakened U.S. and global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to an employee strike, terrorist attack, or other reasons, (6) changes to the regulatory environment and (7) consolidation of competitors in the airline industry. Goodwill. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , our goodwill balance was $9.8 billion . In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering market capitalization and other factors if it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If, however, the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. Identifiable Intangible Assets. Our identifiable intangible assets had a net carrying amount of $4.8 billion at December 31, 2011 . Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to SkyTeam. Definite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of marketing agreements and contracts and are amortized on a straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts. We perform the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the asset's fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) the lease savings method for certain airport slots (which reflects potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at market rates), (3) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (4) projected discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Long-Lived Assets Our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $20.2 billion at December 31, 2011 . This value is based on various factors, including the assets' estimated useful lives and salvage values. We record impairment losses on flight equipment and other long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) significant changes in projected cash flows, (4) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (5) changes to the regulatory environment. For long-lived assets held for sale, we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. To determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If an impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircraft's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. Income Tax Valuation Allowance We periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets and establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry's historically cyclical financial results and potential current and future tax planning strategies. We cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have recorded a full valuation allowance totaling $10.7 billion against our net deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets, we will reverse our valuation allowance (in full or in part), resulting in a significant income tax benefit in the period such a determination is made. 39 Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. As of December 31, 2011 , the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $11.5 billion . During 2011 , we contributed $598 million to these plans and recorded $300 million of expense in salaries and related costs on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In 2012 , we estimate we will contribute approximately $700 million to these plans and that our expense will be approximately $370 million. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets. Weighted Average Discount Rate. We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 4.94% and 5.69% at December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 5.70% to 6.49% between 2009 and 2011 , due to remeasurements throughout the year. Expected Long-Term Rate of Return. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data. Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually. Our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our actual historical annualized three and five year rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans was approximately 11% and 2%, respectively, as of December 31, 2011 . Our annualized five year return includes a -26% return during 2008. The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 9%. The impact of a 0.50% change in these assumptions is shown in the table below: Change in Assumption Effect on 2012 Pension Expense Effect on Accrued Pension Liability at December 31, 2011 0.50% decrease in weighted average discount rate -$1 million +$1.2 billion 0.50% increase in weighted average discount rate - $4 million - $1.1 billion 0.50% decrease in expected long-term rate of return on assets +$39 million 0.50% increase in expected long-term rate of return on assets - $39 million Funding. Our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules ( Alternative Funding Rules ) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. Delta elected the Alternative Funding Rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% interest rate. While the Pension Protection Act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements. Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Recent Accounting Standards Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2009-13. The standard (1) revises guidance on when individual deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting, (2) establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, (3) eliminates the residual method for revenue recognition and (4) provides guidance on allocating consideration among separate deliverables. It applies only to contracts entered into or materially modified after December 31, 2010. We adopted this standard on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2011. We determined that the only revenue arrangements impacted by the adoption of this standard are those associated with our SkyMiles Program. Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements. In May 2011, the FASB issued "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs." The standard revises guidance for fair value measurement and expands the disclosure requirements. It is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Supplemental Information We sometimes use information that is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ). Certain of this information are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The following tables show reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We exclude the following items from CASM to determine CASM-Ex: Aircraft fuel and related taxes. Management believes the volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. Ancillary businesses . Ancillary businesses are not related to the generation of a seat mile. These businesses include aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations. Profit sharing. Management believes the exclusion of this item provides a more meaningful comparison of our results to the airline industry. Restructuring and other items. Management believes the exclusion of this item is helpful to investors to evaluate our recurring core operational performance. Mark-to-market ("MTM") adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Management believes these adjustments are helpful to evaluate our financial results in the period shown. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 CASM 14.12 12.69 Items excluded: Aircraft fuel and related taxes (5.00 ) (3.82 ) Ancillary businesses (0.37 ) (0.28 ) Profit sharing (0.11 ) (0.13 ) Restructuring and other items (0.10 ) (0.19 ) MTM adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period (0.01 ) CASM-Ex 8.53 8.27 41 The following table reconciles average price per fuel gallon to average price per fuel gallon, adjusted for MTM adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period. These mark-to-market adjustments are based on market prices as of the end of the reporting period. Such market prices are not necessarily indicative of the actual future cash value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Therefore, Delta adjusts fuel expense for these items to arrive at a more meaningful measure of fuel cost. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2008 Average price per fuel gallon (1) $ 3.06 $ 3.16 MTM adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period (0.01 ) (0.03 ) Average price per fuel gallon, adjusted $ 3.05 $ 3.13 (1) Includes fuel expense incurred under contract carriers arrangements and the impact of fuel hedge activity Glossary of Defined Terms ASM - Available Seat Mile. A measure of capacity. ASMs equal the total number of seats available for transporting passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the total number of miles flown during that period. CASM - (Operating) Cost per Available Seat Mile. The amount of operating cost incurred per ASM during a reporting period. CASM-Ex - The amount of operating cost incurred per ASM during a reporting period, excluding aircraft fuel and related taxes, ancillary businesses, profit sharing, restructuring and other items and MTM adjustments for fuel hedges recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Passenger Load Factor - A measure of utilized available seating capacity calculated by dividing RPMs by ASMs for a reporting period. Passenger Mile Yield or Yield - The amount of passenger revenue earned per RPM during a reporting period. PRASM - Passenger Revenue per ASM. The amount of passenger revenue earned per ASM during a reporting period. PRASM is also referred to as unit revenue. RPM - Revenue Passenger Mile. One revenue-paying passenger transported one mile. RPMs equal the number of revenue passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the number of miles flown by those passengers during that period. RPMs are also referred to as traffic. 42
