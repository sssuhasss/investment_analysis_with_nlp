Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview TripAdvisor, Inc., by and through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. TripAdvisor, our flagship brand, is the world largest travel site based on monthly unique visitors, and its mission is to help people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip. We accomplish this by, among other things, aggregating millions of members reviews and opinions about destinations, accommodations, activities and attractions, and restaurants worldwide, thereby creating the foundation for a unique platform that enables users to research and plan their travel experiences. Our platform also enables users to compare real-time pricing and availability for these experiences as well as to book hotels, flights, cruises, vacation rentals, tours, activities and attractions, and restaurants, either on a TripAdvisor site or mobile app, or on the site or app of one of our travel partner sites. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites reached 455 million average monthly unique visitors in our seasonal peak during the year ended December 31, 2017, according to our internal log files. We currently feature approximately 600 million reviews and opinions on approximately 7.5 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do including approximately 1.2 million hotels, inns, B&Bs and specialty lodging, 750,000 vacation rentals, 4.6 million restaurants and 915,000 activities and attractions worldwide. In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, we manage and operate 20 other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing users the most comprehensive travel-planning and trip-taking resources in the travel industry. For additional information about our portfolio of brands and our business model, see the disclosure set forth in Part I, Item 1. Business , under the caption Overview. Our reporting structure includes two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. Our Non-Hotel segment consists of our Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals businesses. Financial information and additional descriptive information related to our segments and geographic information is contained in Note 17 Segment and Geographic Information , in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 and below. Executive Financial Summary and Trends As the largest online travel platform, we believe we are an attractive marketing channel for travel partners including hotel chains, independent hoteliers, online travel agencies, or OTAs, destination marketing organizations, and other travel-related and non-travel related product and service providers who seek to sell their products and services to our large user base. We offer users the ability to do real-time price comparison through our metasearch feature, as well as the ability to book hotels, flights, cruises, vacation rentals, tours, activities and attractions, and restaurants either directly on our website or mobile app through our instant booking feature or on one of our travel partner sites. Tax Reform The 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017, and has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation. The 2017 Tax Act also transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which 33 has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). These changes are effective b eginning January 1, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act also includes a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings (the Transition Tax ). Changes in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a charge totaling $73 million related to our current estimate of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, principally due to the Transition Tax. The Transition Tax, recorded of $67 million, will be paid over an eight-year period, starting in 2018, and will not accrue interest. We also recorded a charge of $6 million for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets. These estimates are reflected in our financial results in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118"), which provides for a measurement period to complete the accounting for certain elements of the tax reform. Refer to Note 10 - Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on the financial statement impact of the 2017 Tax Act. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act and interpret additional guidance issued with respect to the 2017 Tax Act, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts. Current Trends in Our Business The online travel industry is large and growing and remains highly dynamic and competitive. Hotel Segment During 2017, we continued to improve the hotel shopping experience on TripAdvisor by, among other things, launching a redesigned TripAdvisor website and mobile application and making it easier for our users to find the lowest hotel prices. We have and will continue to seek new ways to provide a more comprehensive hotel shopping experience, by improving content on destinations, properties and rooms, optimizing the room selection process and helping users find the best prices with our hotelier and OTA partners. On the supply side, we continue to on-board more partners that have unique brand, supply or room pricing to provide consumers a more comprehensive selection of accommodations in order to drive higher repeat usage and conversion of hotel shoppers to bookings and higher cost-per-click rates on our platform. We compete with other travel companies and search engines for hotel shoppers, which we define as the users who view TripAdvisor hotel pages. Hotel shoppers from unpaid online marketing channels, such as users that navigate directly to our homepage or applications through branded search queries on search engines, are of the highest value to our business. Over time, increased competition has resulted in hotel shoppers visiting our websites and applications from paid online marketing channels, such as SEM, to grow faster than traffic from unpaid online marketing channels, such as SEO, thereby increasing our aggregate cost of hotel shopper acquisition. Following the launch of our redesigned website, our new hotel shopping experience, we launched a brand advertising campaign, or television campaign, in June 2017 aimed at increasing usage of TripAdvisor as a place to find and book the best hotels at the lowest prices. We also continue to leverage a number of other marketing channels, both paid and unpaid, to achieve this objective, including online efforts such as social media and cost relationship management or CRM, as well as offline efforts such as TripAdvisor-branded advertising campaigns. Our television campaign has been funded, in part, through optimization of our online marketing spend. We expect to continue to optimize our marketing investment mix, between online and offline channels based on the relative growth opportunity, the expected returns and the competitive environment in which we operate. We believe optimizing our marketing mix to include brand advertising will help TripAdvisor establish a more durable, long-lasting direct relationship with users shopping for hotels, with a greater long-term financial return than we would be able to achieve solely from online paid marketing. Our marketing strategy comes with a near-term trade-off, as online paid marketing may better enable us to generate a short-term hotel shopper and click-based and transaction revenue, whereas we expect our television advertising campaign to generate such returns over a longer timeframe, improving marketing efficiency and profit growth. A key objective is to grow the number of hotel shoppers on our platform at or above our desired return on investment targets. In the year ended December 31, 2017, our average monthly unique hotel shoppers increased 7%, when compared to the same period in 2016, according to our internal log files. The increase is primarily due to the general trend of an increasing number of hotel shoppers visiting our websites and apps on mobile phones, as well as the success of our paid online marketing strategy, partially offset by marketing spend tradeoffs resulting from increased brand advertising investment in our television campaign, as discussed above. 34 Another key objective is to increase our revenue per ho tel shopper. In the year ended December 31, 2017, our revenue per hotel shopper decreased 7%, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily driven by partners bidding to lower CPCs in our click-based metasearch auction during the second half of the y ear, and the general trend of a greater percentage of hotel shoppers visiting TripAdvisor-branded websites and apps on mobile phones. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the growth rate of hotel shoppers that visited our websites and apps on mobile ph ones continued to grow significantly faster than that of hotel shoppers using desktop and tablet devices. Mobile phones currently generate significantly lower revenue per hotel shopper compared to desktop and tablet devices. We believe that this monetizati on difference is due to a number of factors, including the reduced ability to achieve marketing attribution on the mobile phone for facilitating traffic to partner websites and applications; more limited advertising opportunities on smaller screen devices; our historic positioning as a place to read reviews; and general consumer purchasing patterns on mobile phones resulting in lower booking intent, lower conversion rates, lower cost-per-click bids from our travel partners, and lower average gross booking v alue. As a result, our growth in hotel shoppers on mobile phones has remained a headwind against our overall revenue per hotel shopper and our TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue. The general trend of increasing traffic to our websites and apps on mobile phones reduces our ability to grow TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising revenue, as we believe prioritizing and preserving a cleaner user experience over increasing advertising units on smaller screen devices is the most appropriate way to engage more users on our mobile phone app. We continue to prioritize investment in product development in order to improve the mobile user experience, and to improve mobile phone traffic acquisition to increase our user base. We believe that, over the long-term, these efforts will result in increased usage and engagement, conversion of hotel shoppers to bookings for our hotel advertising partners and higher monetization rates for us. Non-Hotel Segment Our ongoing product efforts to deliver an end-to-end user experience extend to our Non-Hotel segment, which includes our Attractions, Restaurants, and Vacation Rentals businesses. Our key growth strategies have been to grow users, improve our products and grow bookable supply. We continued to deliver on those objectives during the year ended December 31, 2017, as monthly unique users to these pages on our websites and applications continued to grow, we enhanced our product experience on all devices, and we grew bookable supply on our platform in our Attractions and Restaurants businesses. Notably, we have been able to increasingly leverage strong user growth on the TripAdvisor-branded platform to drive increased bookings in our Attractions business. Additionally, our Attractions and Restaurants businesses have both experienced increased engagement and growth on mobile phones. In Vacation Rentals, as the business continues to shift from our subscription model to our free-to-list model, we have focused on delivering high-quality supply for users in order to drive conversion for partners on our platform. We continued to work to improve content and overall user experience across each business. Continued successful execution of our key growth strategies and increased marketing and operating efficiencies primarily contributed to this segment revenue and profit growth during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. Our ongoing strategic objectives are to continue to enhance the user experience, to grow traffic and drive increased user engagement, to grow bookable supply, and to grow bookings in this segment. 35 Results of Operations Selected Financial Data (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages) Year ended December 31, % Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Revenue $ 1,556 $ 1,480 $ 1,492 5 % (1 )% Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue 72 71 58 1 % 22 % Selling and marketing 849 756 692 12 % 9 % Technology and content 243 243 207 0 % 17 % General and administrative 157 143 210 10 % (32 )% Depreciation 79 69 57 14 % 21 % Amortization of intangible assets 32 32 36 0 % (11 )% Total costs and expenses 1,432 1,314 1,260 9 % 4 % Operating income 124 166 232 (25 )% (28 )% Other income (expense): Interest expense (15 ) (12 ) (10 ) 25 % 20 % Interest income and other, net 1 (3 ) 17 133 % (118 )% Total other income (expense), net (14 ) (15 ) 7 (7 )% (314 )% Income before income taxes 110 151 239 (27 )% (37 )% Provision for income taxes (129 ) (31 ) (41 ) 316 % (24 )% Net income (loss) $ (19 ) $ 120 $ 198 (116 )% (39 )% Earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic $ (0.14 ) $ 0.83 $ 1.38 (117 )% (40 )% Diluted $ (0.14 ) $ 0.82 $ 1.36 (117 )% (40 )% Other financial data: Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 331 $ 352 $ 466 (6 )% (24 )% (1) See Adjusted EBITDA discussion below for more information.

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin by Segment , as Adjusted EBITDA by segment divided by revenue by segment. 36 Hotel Segment Our Hotel segment revenue increased $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a $6 million increase in TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue and a $10 million increase in TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $10 million in other hotel revenue, all of which are discussed below. Our Hotel segment revenue decreased $73 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a $87 million decrease in TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue, partially offset by growth of $10 million in TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue, and $4 million in other hotel revenue, all of which are discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Hotel segment decreased $94 million and to 24%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to costs related to our television campaign, which launched in June 2017, and also due to increased SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs during the first half of 2017, partially offset by cost efficiencies created through optimization of our online marketing spend during the second half of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Hotel segment decreased $92 million and decreased to 32%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in Hotel segment revenue, which is discussed below, and increased operating costs, primarily driven by an increase in online traffic acquisition costs, partially offset by lower television advertising costs due to the cessation of our 2015 television advertising campaign in 2016. The following is a detailed discussion of the revenue sources within our Hotel segment: Year ended December 31, % Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs 2016 2016 vs 2015 Hotel: (in millions) TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction $ 756 $ 750 $ 837 1 % (10 %) TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription 292 282 272 4 % 4 % Other hotel revenue 148 158 154 (6 %) 3 % Total Hotel revenue $ 1,196 $ 1,190 $ 1,263 1 % (6 %) TripAdvisor-branded Click-based and Transaction Revenue TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue includes cost-per-click-based advertising revenue from our TripAdvisor-branded websites as well as transaction-based revenue from our hotel instant booking feature. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 63%, 63% and 66%, respectively, of our total Hotel segment revenue was derived from our TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue. TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue increased $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in average monthly unique hotel shoppers of 7%, which was largely offset by a decrease of 7% in revenue per hotel shopper during the year ended December 31, 2017, which is explained below. TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue decreased $87 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decline of 15% in revenue per hotel shopper, partially offset by an increase in average monthly unique hotel shoppers of 6% during the year ended December 31, 2016, which is explained below. Our largest source of Hotel segment revenue is click-based advertising revenue from our TripAdvisor-branded websites, which include links to our travel partners sites and contextually-relevant branded and related text links. Click-based advertising is generated primarily through our metasearch auction, a description of which follows. Our click-based travel partners are predominantly OTAs and hoteliers. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or CPC, basis, with payments to us from advertisers based on the number of users who click on each type of link or, in other words, the conversion of a hotel shopper to a paid click. CPC is the price that a partner is willing to pay us for a hotel shopper lead and is determined in a competitive process that enables our partners to submit CPC bids to have their rates and availability listed on our site. When a partner submits a CPC bid, they agree 37 to pay us the bid amount each time a user subsequently clicks on the link to that partner website. Bids can be submitted periodically as often as daily on a property-by-property basis. Primary factors used to determine the placement of partner links on our sit e include, but are not limited to, room night price, the size of the bid relative to other bids, and other variables. CPCs are generally lower in markets outside the U.S. market, and hotel shoppers visiting via mobile phones currently monetize at a signifi cantly lower rate than hotel shoppers visiting via desktop or tablet. Our Hotel segment transaction-based revenue is comprised of revenue from our hotel instant booking feature, which enables the merchant of record, generally an OTA or hotel partner, to pay a commission to TripAdvisor for a user that completes a hotel reservation via our website. This feature was rolled out in our two largest markets the United States and the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2015, and we completed an accelerated and staged global rollout of this feature to all of our markets during the first half of 2016. Instant booking revenue is currently recognized under two different models: the consumption model and the transaction model. Under the consumption model, which currently represents the majority of our instant booking revenue, commission revenue is not recorded until such time as the traveler completes their stay, at which time our consumption partner is liable to us for commission payment. Under the transaction model commission revenue is recorded at the time a traveler books a hotel reservation on our site, as our transaction partner is liable for commission payments to us upon booking and the partner assumes the cancellation risk. OTA and hotel partner placement, as well as comparative hotel prices available to the traveler in the booking process under both models, is determined by a bidding process within our proprietary automated bidding system, that takes into account a number of variables, primarily hotel room prices, but also including other factors, such as conversion rates and commission rates, depending on the specific hotel selected. Instant booking commissions are primarily a function of average gross booking value generated from hotel reservations, cancellation rates experienced, and commission rates negotiated with each of our partners. The key drivers of TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue include growth in average monthly unique hotel shoppers and revenue per hotel shopper growth, the latter of which measures how effectively we convert our hotel shoppers into revenue. We measure performance by calculating revenue per hotel shopper on an aggregate basis by dividing total TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue by total average monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor-branded websites for the periods presented. While we believe that total traffic growth, or growth in monthly visits from unique visitors, is reflective of our overall brand growth, we also track and analyze sub-segments of our traffic and their correlation to revenue generation and utilize data regarding hotel shoppers as one of the key indicators of revenue growth. Hotel shoppers are visitors who view either a listing of hotels in a city or on a specific hotel page. The number of hotel shoppers tends to vary based on seasonality of the travel industry and general economic conditions, as well as other factors outside of our control. Given these factors, as well as the trend towards increased usage on mobile phones and international expansion, quarterly and annual hotel shopper growth is a difficult metric to forecast. The below table summarizes our revenue per hotel shopper calculation and growth rate, in aggregate, for the periods presented (in millions, except calculated revenue per hotel shopper and percentages): Year ended December 31, % Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs 2016 2016 vs 2015 (in millions) Revenue per hotel shopper: TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue $ 756 $ 750 $ 837 1 % (10 %) Divided by: Total average monthly unique hotel shoppers for the year 1,768 1,645 1,555 7 % 6 % $ 0.43 $ 0.46 $ 0.54 (7 %) (15 %) 38 2017 vs. 2016 Revenue per hotel shopper decreased 7% during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, according to our internal log files. The decrease was primarily driven by partners bidding to lower CPCs in our click-based metasearch auction during the second half of the year, and the general trend of a greater percentage of hotel shoppers visiting TripAdvisor-branded websites and apps on mobile phones, which monetize at a lower rate than desktop hotel shoppers, which grew significantly faster than traffic from desktop and tablet devices, as well as dilution from product testing related to the second-quarter 2017 launch of our redesigned website and applications, and the timing of our instant booking feature rollout in certain non-U.S. markets during the first half of 2016. Our aggregate average monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor-branded websites increased by 7% during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, according to our internal log files. The increase in hotel shoppers is primarily due to the general trend of an increasing number of hotel shoppers visiting our websites and apps on mobile phones, as well as growth in our paid online marketing channels, partially offset by marketing spend tradeoffs resulting from increased brand advertising investment in our television campaign, as discussed above. 2016 vs. 2015 Revenue per hotel shopper decreased 15% during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, according to our internal log files. We believe the primary drivers of this decrease included the dilutive effects from our global launch of our instant booking feature, which impacted 2016 to a greater extent than 2015 due to the timing of the staged rollout; a greater percentage of hotel shoppers visiting TripAdvisor websites and apps via mobile phones; challenging metasearch comparatives in early 2016 relative to the same periods in 2015; increased competition; macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including foreign currency and a number of terrorism events. Our aggregate average monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor-branded websites increased by 6% during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, according to our internal log files. The increase in hotel shoppers was primarily due to growth in our paid online marketing channels as well as the general trend of an increasing number of hotel shoppers visiting our websites and apps on mobile phones during 2016, which has grown significantly faster than traffic from desktop and tablet devices. TripAdvisor-branded Display-based Advertising and Subscription Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 24%, 24% and 22%, respectively, of our Hotel segment revenue was derived from our TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue, which primarily consists of revenue from display-based advertising and subscription-based hotel advertising revenue. Our TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue increased by $10 million or 4%, during each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2016 and 2015. 2017 vs. 2016 The increase in display-based advertising revenue was primarily due to an increase in impressions sold, as well as an increase in pricing, partially offset by the general trend of an increasing percentage of our traffic visiting our websites and apps on mobile phones. While we continue to focus on new product initiatives to drive growth, our subscription revenue decreased slightly, primarily as we work to enhance our product offering to hoteliers and increase our sales pipeline in this business, in addition to hotel industry consolidation. 2016 vs. 2015 The increase in display-based advertising revenue was primarily due to a slight increase in pricing, as well as impressions sold during the year, while the increase in subscription revenue was a result of increased sales productivity in 2015 which also benefitted 2016, as well as increased pricing and improvements in customer retention rates. 39 Other Hotel Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 12%, 13% and 12%, respectively, of our Hotel segment revenue was derived from other hotel revenues. Our other hotel revenue primarily includes revenue from non-TripAdvisor branded websites, such as bookingbuddy.com, cruisecritic.com, and onetime.com, including click-based advertising revenue, display-based advertising revenue and room reservations sold through these websites. Our other hotel revenue decreased by $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to increased focus on return on marketing spend from paid marketing channels within this revenue stream. Our other hotel revenue increased $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. Non-Hotel Segment For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our Non-Hotel segment revenue accounted for 23%, 20% and 15%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenue. Our Non-Hotel segment revenue increased by $70 million or 24%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by increased bookings in our Attractions and Restaurants businesses. Our Non-Hotel segment revenue increased $61 million, or 27%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by increased bookings across all businesses. During this timeframe, strong revenue growth in our Attractions business has been driven by the following factors: growth in bookings sourced by TripAdvisor, growth in bookable supply, which leads to better consumer choice, as well as by growth in free and paid traffic sources. Another contributing factor is the improved shopping experience from the introduction of new features, such as attractions instant booking for mobile phone, which enables users to purchase tickets and tours seamlessly without leaving the mobile app. These factors are all contributing to more consumer choice, increased bookings and continued revenue growth. Similarly, in our Restaurants business, continued strong revenue growth can be attributed to increased bookings in our most established markets, expansion into new markets, growth in mobile bookings, a continually improving user experience and an increase in bookable supply of restaurant listings. Revenue in our Vacation Rentals business decreased slightly during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the continued migration of our subscription model to our free-to-list model, which we believe will have a longer term return to the business, in addition to slower growth in our free-to-list revenues than 2016. Revenue in our Vacation Rentals business increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to growth in our free-to-list model and increased bookings during the year. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Non-Hotel segment increased $73 million and to 13%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased revenue growth, in addition to increased efficiencies in paid online marketing channels and other operational synergies across our Attractions and Vacation Rentals businesses, partially offset by increased personnel and overhead costs to support growth in this segment for the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in our Non-Hotel segment decreased $22 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased personnel and overhead costs of $47 million, in addition to increased online traffic acquisition costs and merchant credit card and transaction fees, which more than offset the increase in revenue. 40 Revenue by Geography The following table presents our revenue by geographic region. Revenue by geography is based on the geographic location of our websites: Year ended December 31, % Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs 2016 2016 vs 2015 (in millions) Revenue by geographic region (1): United States $ 877 $ 800 $ 739 10 % 8 % Europe 415 411 432 1 % (5 %) ROW 264 269 321 (2 %) (16 %) Total $ 1,556 $ 1,480 $ 1,492 5 % (1 %) (1) In the first quarter of 2017, we reclassified Canada, Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) and Latin America ( LATAM ) into rest of world ( ROW ) when presenting our revenue by geographic region. Prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. This change had no effect on our consolidated financial statements in any reporting period. Our U.S. revenue increased $77 million or 10%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016. U. S. revenue represented 56% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. This revenue increase in the U.S. was due primarily to growth in our Attractions business, as well as an increase in U.S. TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue, driven by growth in U.S. revenue per hotel shopper. Our U.S. revenue increased $61 million or 8%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. U. S. revenue represented 54% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016. This revenue increase in U.S. was due primarily to growth in our Attractions business and our U.S. display-based advertising and subscription revenue. Revenue outside of the U.S., or non-U.S. revenue, decreased $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016. Non-U.S. revenue decreased $73 million or 10%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. Non-U.S. revenue represented approximately 44%, 46%, and 50% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The decline in our non-U.S. revenue, as a percentage of total revenue during these periods, was primarily driven by the factors noted in the growth of our U.S. revenue discussed above, as well as the timing of our instant booking feature rollout in non-U.S. markets during the first half of 2016, and its associated dilutive impact to Trip-Advisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue, as compared to the rollout in our U.S. market, which was completed in the third quarter of 2015, and to a lesser extent foreign currency fluctuations. Consolidated Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of expenses that are directly related or closely correlated to revenue generation, including direct costs, such as ad serving fees, flight search fees, credit card fees and other transaction costs, and data center costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses for certain customer support personnel who are directly involved in revenue generation.

Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of direct costs, including traffic generation costs from SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, syndication costs and affiliate program commissions, social media costs, brand advertising, television and other offline advertising, promotions and public relations. In addition, our sales and marketing expenses consist of indirect costs such as personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support and marketing employees.

We spent $74 million on our television advertising campaign during the year ended December 31, 2017 in our Hotel segment, which we did not incur during the year ended December 31, 2016. 2016 vs. 2015 Direct selling and marketing costs increased $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to increased SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs of $79 million primarily driven by our Hotel segment, partially offset by a decrease in costs related to the cessation of our television advertising campaign. We spent $51 million on our television advertising campaign during the year ended December 31, 2015 in our Hotel segment, which we did not incur during the year ended December 31, 2016. Personnel and overhead costs increased $24 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in headcount in our Non-Hotel segment, which was needed to support business growth.

Personnel and overhead costs increased $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily to support our mobile phone and website initiatives, as well as to support business growth, partially offset by a decrease in contingent staff costs. Other costs decreased by $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in content translation costs. 2016 vs. 2015 Technology and content costs increased $36 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to increased personnel costs, including an increase of $12 million in stock-based compensation, from increased headcount needed to support business growth, including international expansion and enhanced site features. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs, including personnel engaged in executive leadership, finance, legal, and human resources, as well as stock-based compensation expense for those same personnel.

Personnel costs and overhead costs increased $15 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily related to an increase in stock-based compensation of $10 million. Professional service fees and other decreased $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in consulting costs and non-income taxes, partially offset by an increase in bad debt costs. 43 2016 vs. 2015 General and administrative costs decreased $67 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. Personnel costs and overhead costs decreased $5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. Professional service fees and other also decreased $62 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a non-cash charitable contribution of $67 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, which did not reoccur in 2016, partially offset by increased consulting costs, non-income taxes, and bad debt expense. Refer to Note 17 Segment and Geographic Information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 and below discussion in Adjusted EBITDA , for a discussion of this charitable contribution. Depreciation Depreciation expense consists of depreciation on computer equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture, office equipment and other assets, our corporate headquarters building and amortization of capitalized software and website development costs. Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Depreciation $ 79 $ 69 $ 57 % of revenue 5.1 % 4.7 % 3.8 % Depreciation expense increased $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to increased amortization related to capitalized software and website development costs of $8 million. Depreciation expense increased $12 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to increased amortization related to capitalized software and website development costs of $9 million and incremental depreciation on our corporate headquarters building of $1 million. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our corporate headquarters asset. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization consists of the amortization of purchased definite-lived intangibles.

Amortization of intangible assets decreased $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets from previous business acquisitions. Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions and Dispositions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our acquisitions. 44 Interest Expense Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred, commitment fees and debt issuance cost amortization related to our 2015 Credit Facility, 2016 Credit Facility, and Chinese Credit Facilities, as well as interest on our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters. Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Interest expense $ (15 ) $ (12 ) $ (10 ) Interest expense increased $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in interest incurred due to higher average outstanding borrowings and effective interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily on our 2015 Credit Facility. Interest expense increased $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase of $3 million in interest imputed on our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters lease in 2016, partially offset by a decrease in interest incurred due to lower average outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily on our 2015 Credit Facility. Refer to Note 9 Debt and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our borrowing facilities and our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters, respectively. Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net primarily consists of interest earned and amortization of discounts and premiums on our marketable securities, net foreign exchange gains and losses, and gains and losses on sales of our marketable securities and sale of businesses. Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Interest income and other, net $ 1 $ (3 ) $ 17 2017 vs. 2016 Interest income and other, net increased $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in net foreign currency transaction gains of $6 million, as a result of the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a loss of $2 million related to one of our cost-method investments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. 2016 vs. 2015 Interest income and other, net decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a $20 million gain from sale of business of one of our Chinese subsidiaries in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016. Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 129 $ 31 $ 41 Effective tax rate 117.3 % 20.5 % 17.2 % On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into United States tax law. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering corporate income tax rates, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The 2017 Tax Act permanently reduces the U.S. 45 corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, including $67 million of tax expense recorded for the Transition Tax, and $6 million recorded for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, are reflected in our fina ncial results in accordance with SAB 118, which provides for a measurement period to complete the accounting for certain elements of the tax reform . Refer to Note 10 - Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for furth er information on the financial statement impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Our effective tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate in the United States primarily due to the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform, foreign valuation allowances, and non-deductible stock based compensation. This is partially offset by earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, where our effective tax rate is lower. 2017 vs. 2016 Our effective tax rate increased to 117.3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 from 20.5% in the same period in 2016. The change in the effective tax rate for 2017 compared to the 2016 rate was primarily due to the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform, foreign valuation allowances, and non-deductible stock based compensation. 2016 vs. 2015 Our effective tax rate increased to 20.5% during the year ended December 31, 2016 from 17.2% in the same period in 2015. The change in the effective tax rate for 2016 compared to the 2015 rate was primarily due to a change in jurisdictional earnings, which includes a non-cash charitable contribution during the year ended December 31, 2015, which did not reoccur in 2016, and the recognition of prior year tax benefits in response to a recent U.S. Tax Court ruling in regards to Altera Corporation on the treatment of stock-based compensation in cost-sharing arrangements. Refer to Note 10 - Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on the impact of this Tax Court ruling. Adjusted EBITDA To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure refers to a numerical measure of a company historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) in such company financial statements. Adjusted EBITDA is our segment profit measure and a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the operating performance of our business and on which internal budgets and forecasts are based and approved. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: (1) provision for income taxes; (2) other income (expense), net; (3) depreciation of property and equipment, including amortization of internal use software and website development; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) stock-based compensation and other stock-settled obligations; (6) goodwill, long-lived asset and intangible asset impairments; and (7) other non-recurring expenses and income. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results. 46 Some of these limitations ar e: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation or other stock-settled obligations; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented: Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Net income (loss) $ (19 ) $ 120 $ 198 Add: Provision for income taxes 129 31 41 Add: Other expense (income), net 14 15 (7 ) Add: Other non-recurring expenses - - 2 Add: Non-cash charitable contribution (1) - - 67 Add: Stock-based compensation 96 85 72 Add: Amortization of intangible assets 32 32 36 Add: Depreciation 79 69 57 Adjusted EBITDA $ 331 $ 352 $ 466 (1) During the fourth quarter of 2015, we incurred an expense in the amount of $67 million to reflect a non-cash contribution to The TripAdvisor Charitable Foundation (the Foundation ), which was recorded to general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations. We settled this obligation in treasury shares based on the fair value of our common stock on the date the shares were issued to the Foundation. Given the use of stock to settle the obligation, the amount has been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. TripAdvisor does not expect to make any future contributions to the Foundation. Refer to Note 17 Segment and Geographic Information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of this charitable contribution. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows generated from operations, although liquidity needs can also be met through drawdowns under our credit facilities, which are discussed below. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $735 million and $746 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term available-for-sale marketable securities. As of December 31, 2017 approximately $518 million of our cash and cash equivalents, and $62 million of short and long-term available-for-sale marketable securities, were held by our international subsidiaries outside of the United States, with the majority in the United Kingdom . As of December 31, 2017 the majority of total cash on hand is denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $230 million in long-term debt, within our U.S subsidiaries, and approximately $967 million of borrowing capacity available under our 2015 Credit Facility. The weighted average rate of our outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017 was 47 2.74% per annum, under a one-month interest period, which will reset periodically. Refer to Note 20 Subsequent Events in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on the subsequent repayment of our $230 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility in 2018. In addition, we had $73 million borrowing capacity available under our 2016 Credit Facility with no outstanding borrowing as of December 31, 2017. Finally, as of December 31, 2017, we had short-term borrowings of $7 million and approximately $33 million of available borrowing capacity under our Chinese Credit Facilities, which bear interest at a rate based on People Bank of China benchmark, i ncluding certain adjustments which may be made in accordance with the market condition at the time of borrowing, or a weighted average rate of 5.00%. For further discussion on our credit facilities, see below, and also refer to Note 9 Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $882 million as of December 31, 2017. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, on February 2, 2018, TripAdvisor made a one-time repatriation of $325 million of foreign earnings to the United States primarily to repay our remaining outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility. Refer to Note 20 Subsequent Events in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on this repatriation. TripAdvisor intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining foreign undistributed earnings of $557 million, although we will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our capital deployment within and outside the U.S. Should we distribute, or be treated under certain U.S. tax rules as having distributed, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes or tax benefits. The amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax on this temporary difference is not material. Certain transactions have seasonal fluctuations that affect the timing of our annual cash flows related to working capital. In our Vacation Rentals free-to-list model and our Attractions business, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts, net of commissions, on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant payables. We pay the suppliers, or the vacation rental owners and tour providers, respectively, after the travelers use. Therefore, we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying the supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source or use of cash to us. During the first half of the year vacation rentals and attractions bookings typically exceed stays and tour-taking, resulting in higher cash flow related to working capital, while during the second half of the year, particularly in the third quarter, this pattern reverses and cash flows from these transactions are typically negative. While we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue, further significant shifts in our business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends. On February 15, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $250 million of our shares of common stock under a share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not repurchase any shares of outstanding common stock under the share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 2,002,356 shares of outstanding common stock under the share repurchase program at an average cost of $52.35 per share, or $105 million, and completed this share repurchase program. On January 25, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $250 million of our shares of common stock under a new share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased a total of 6,079,003 shares of the Company outstanding common stock at an average share price of $41.13, or $250 million in the aggregate, and completed this share repurchase program. On January 31, 2018, TripAdvisor Board of Directors authorized up to $250 million of share repurchases. This new repurchase program has no expiration but may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Refer to Note 20 Subsequent Events in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on this repurchase program. We believe that our available cash and marketable securities, combined with expected cash flows generated by operating activities and available cash from our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our foreseeable working capital requirements, capital expenditures, existing business growth initiatives, debt obligations, lease commitments, and other financial commitments through at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions, share repurchases, and/or other expenditures in support of our business strategy; thus potentially reducing our cash balance and/or increasing our debt. We expect total capital expenditures for 2018 to be comparable to our 2017 spending levels. 48 Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 238 $ 321 $ 418 Investing activities 6 (163 ) (58 ) Financing activities (200 ) (143 ) (189 ) 2017 vs. 2016 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $83 million or 26% when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in net income of $139 million and a net decrease in working capital movements of $14 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash items affecting cash flow of $70 million which is primarily due to an increase in the following items: deferred tax expenses; stock-based compensation; and depreciation. The decrease in working capital movements of $14 million was primarily due to timing of collection of receivables, income tax payments, vendor payments, and deferred merchant payments. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by investing activities increased by $169 million when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a net increase in cash provided from the purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable securities of $120 million, a decrease in cash paid for business acquisitions of $43 million and a decrease in capital expenditures of $8 million. Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities increased by $57 million when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase of $145 million in cash used in 2017 to purchase shares of our common stock under our authorized share repurchase program in 2017, net new borrowings on our 2016 Credit Facility of $73 million in 2016 which was subsequently repaid in 2017, net borrowings under our Chinese Credit Facility of $6 million in 2016 which did not reoccur in 2017, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility of $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016. Refer to the discussion of our credit facilities below. 2016 vs. 2015 Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $97 million or 23% when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net income of $78 million and a decrease in working capital movements of $11 million, which was primarily due to timing of collection of receivables, income tax payments, vendor payments, and deferred merchant payments. Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities increased by $105 million when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a net increase in cash used for the purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable securities of $103 million, net proceeds from the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries of $25 million in 2015 which did not reoccur in 2016, and a net increase in cash paid for business acquisitions and other investments of $14 million, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $37 million, primarily related to the completion of our corporate headquarters building in mid-2015. 49 Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities decreased by $46 million when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to: (i) a repayment of our 2011 credit facility of $300 million in 2015, (ii) a decrease in borrowings of $186 million in 2016 from our 2015 Credit Facility, (iii) incremental borrowings of $3 million and a decrease in repayments of $40 million in 2016 on our Chinese Credit Facilities, (iv) a decrease in tax withholding payments of $58 million and cash received for stock option exercises of $5 million in 2016 primarily related to a decrease in the number of stock options exercised and lower average stock price in 2016, and (v) borrowings on our 2016 Credit Facility of $73 million in 2016; partially offset by (i) an increase in repayments of $120 million in 2016 related to our 2015 Credit Facility, (ii) payments of $105 million for common stock share repurchases under an authorized share repurchase program in 2016, and (iii) $12 million in lease incentive payments received related to our corporate headquarters in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016. The following table aggregates our material contractual obligations and minimum commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017: By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years (in millions) 2015 Credit Facility and Chinese Credit Facilities (1) $ 237 $ 7 $ $ 230 $ Expected interest and commitment fee payments on 2015 Credit Facility (2) 34 7 16 11 Property leases, net of sublease income (3) 228 28 53 51 96 Total (4)(5) $ 499 $ 42 $ 69 $ 292 $ 96 (1) Debt repayment amounts assume that our existing debt under our 2015 Credit Facility, or $230 million, is repaid at the end of the credit agreement and do not assume additional borrowings or refinancing of existing debt.

Refer to Note 20 Subsequent Events in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on the subsequent repayment of our outstanding borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility in 2018. (2) Expected interest payments on the 2015 Credit Facility are based on the effective interest rate and outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2017, but could change significantly in the future. Amounts assume that our existing debt is repaid at the end of the credit agreement and do not assume additional borrowings or refinancing of existing debt. Expected commitment fee payments are based on the unused portion of credit facility, issued letters of credit, and current effective commitment fee rate as of December 31, 2017; however, these variables could change significantly in the future. Refer to Note 9 Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our 2015 Credit Facility.

Refer to discussion under Office Lease Commitments below. (4) Excluded from the table was $127 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, that we have recorded in other long-term liabilities for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. We do not anticipate any material changes in the next year. Also excluded from the table was $61 million of estimated Transition Tax related to the 2017 Tax Act recorded in long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, that we believe the majority will be paid more than five years from December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 10 - Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of these amounts. (5) Excluded from the table was $3 million of undrawn standby letters of credit, related to our property leases. 2015 Credit Facility In June 2015, we entered into a five year credit agreement with a group of lenders which, among other things, provided for a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility ) and immediately borrowed 50 $290 million. In May 2017 , the 2015 Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate amount of revolving loan commitments available from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion; and (ii) extend the maturity date of the 2015 Credit Facility from June 26, 2020 to May 12, 2022 (the First Amendment ). Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility generally bear interest, at the Company option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the Eurocurrency Borrowing rate, or the adjusted LIBO rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing; plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% ( Eurocurrency Spread ), based on the Company leverage ratio; or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) Borrowing, which is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the New York Fed Bank Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1.00% per annum and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (or LIBO rate multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate) for an interest period of one mont h plus 1.00%; in addition to an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% ( ABR Spread ), based on the Company leverage ratio. The Company may borrow from the revolving credit facility in U.S dollars, Euros and British pound sterling. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company borrowed an additional $435 million and repaid $296 million of our outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility. These net borrowings during the year were primarily used to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock under the Company repurchase program, which is described in Note 15 - Stockholders Equity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. As of December 31, 2017, based on the Company leverage ratio, our borrowings bear interest at LIBO rate; plus an applicable margin of 1.25%, or the Eurocurrency Spread. The Company was borrowing under a one-month interest rate period or a weighted average rate of 2.74% per annum as of December 31, 2017, using a one-month interest period Eurocurrency Spread, which will reset periodically. Interest will be payable on a monthly basis while the Company is borrowing under the one-month interest rate period. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, at an applicable rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.30%, on the daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility for each fiscal quarter and additional fees in connection with the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2017, our unused revolver capacity was subject to a commitment fee of 0.15%, given the Company leverage ratio. The 2015 Credit Facility includes $15 million of borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and $40 million for Swing Line borrowings on same-day notice. As of December 31, 2017, we had issued $3 million of outstanding letters of credit under the 2015 Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $101 million and repaid $210 million of our outstanding borrowings on the 2015 Credit Facility. There is no specific repayment date prior to the maturity date for borrowings under this credit agreement. We may voluntarily repay any outstanding borrowing under the 2015 Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to Eurocurrency loans. Additionally, the Company believes that the likelihood of the lender exercising any subjective acceleration rights, which would permit the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding borrowings, is remote. As such, we classify borrowings under this facility as long-term debt as of December 31, 2017. The 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends and distributions, make investments, loans or advances, prepay certain subordinated indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend material agreements governing certain subordinated indebtedness, and change our fiscal year. The 2015 Credit Facility also requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the 2015 Credit Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of all amounts due under the 2015 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 2016 Credit Facility In September 2016, we entered into an uncommitted facility agreement which provides for a $73 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2016 Credit Facility ) with no specific expiration date. The 2016 Credit Facility is available at the Lender discretion and can be canceled at any time. Repayment terms for borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility are generally one to six month periods, or such other periods as the parties may mutually agree, and bear interest at LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points. The Company may borrow from the 2016 Credit Facility in U.S dollars only and we may voluntarily repay any outstanding borrowing at any time without premium or penalty. Any overdue amounts under or in respect of the 2016 Credit Facility not paid when due shall bear interest in the case of principal at the applicable interest rate plus 1.50% per annum. There are no specific financial or incurrence covenants. 51 We borrowed $73 million from this uncommitted credit facility in September 2016, which was included in current portion of debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. These funds were used for general working capital needs of the Company, p rimarily for partial repayment of our 2015 Credit Facility. The Company repaid all outstanding borrowings during the first three months of 2017 and as of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility. Chinese Credit Facilities In addition to our 2015 Credit Facility and 2016 Credit Facility, we maintain two credit facilities in China (jointly, the Chinese Credit Facilities ). We are parties to a $30 million, one-year revolving credit facility with Bank of America (the Chinese Credit Facility BOA ) that is currently subject to review on a periodic basis with no specific expiration period. Borrowings under our Chinese Credit Facility BOA generally bears interest at a rate based on People Bank of China benchmark, including certain adjustments which may be made in accordance with the market condition at the time of borrowing. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Chinese Credit Facility BOA. We are also parties to a RMB 70,000,000 (approximately $10 million), one-year revolving credit facility with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( Chinese Credit Facility JPM ). Our Chinese Credit Facility JPM generally bears interest at a rate based on People Bank of China benchmark, including certain adjustments which may be made in accordance with the market condition at the time of borrowing. As of both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $7 million of outstanding borrowings from the Chinese Credit Facility JPM at a weighted average rate of 5.00% and 4.35%, respectively. Office Lease Commitments In June 2013, we entered into a lease, for a new corporate headquarters (the Lease ). Pursuant to the Lease, the landlord built an approximately 280,000 square foot rental building in Needham, Massachusetts (the Premises ), and leased the Premises to the Company as our new corporate headquarters for an initial term of 15 years and 7 months or through December 2030. The Company also has an option to extend the term of the Lease for two consecutive terms of five years each. Because we were involved in the construction project and were responsible for paying a portion of the costs of normal finish work and structural elements of the Premises, the Company was deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the Premises during the construction period under build to suit lease accounting guidance under GAAP. Therefore, the Company recorded project construction costs during the construction period incurred by the landlord as a construction-in-progress asset and a related construction financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. The amounts that the Company has paid or incurred for normal tenant improvements and structural improvements had also been recorded to the construction-in-progress asset. Upon completion of construction at end of the second quarter of 2015, we evaluated the construction-in-progress asset and construction financing obligation for de-recognition under the criteria for sale-leaseback treatment under GAAP. We concluded that we have forms of continued economic involvement in the facility, and therefore did not meet the provisions for sale-leaseback accounting. This determination was based on the Company's continuing involvement with the property in the form of non-recourse financing to the lessor. Therefore, the Lease is accounted for as a financing obligation. Accordingly, we began depreciating the building asset over its estimated useful life and incurring interest expense related to the financing obligation imputed using the effective interest rate method. We bifurcate our lease payments pursuant to the Premises into: (i) a portion that is allocated to the building (a reduction to the financing obligation) and; (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the building was constructed. The portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease that commenced in 2013. The lease costs allocated to the land are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The financing obligation is considered a long-term finance lease obligation and is recorded to other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. At the end of the lease term, the carrying value of the building asset and the remaining financing obligation are expected to be equal, at which time we may either surrender the 52 leased asset as settlement of the remaining financing obligation or extend the initial term of the lease for the continued use of the asset. In the years en ded December 31 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company recorded $7 million, $7 million, and $4 million of interest expense, respectively, $3 million, $3 million, and $2 million of depreciation expense, respectively, and $2 million, $2 million, $1 million, of re nt expense in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of operations, respectively, related to the Premises. We also lease an aggregate of approximately 450,000 square feet of office space at approximately 40 other locations across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, in cities such as, New York, Boston, London, Sydney, Barcelona, Paris, and Beijing, primarily for our sales offices, subsidiary headquarters, and international management teams, pursuant to leases with various expiration dates, with the latest expiring in June 2027. As of December 31, 2017, future minimum commitments under our corporate headquarters lease and other non-cancelable operating leases for office space with terms of more than one year and contractual sublease income were as follows: Year Corporate Headquarters Lease (1) Other Operating Leases Sublease Income Total Lease Commitments (Net of Sublease Income) (in millions) 2018 $ 9 $ 22 $ (3 ) $ 28 2019 9 21 (3 ) 27 2020 9 19 (2 ) 26 2021 10 17 (2 ) 25 2022 10 17 (1 ) 26 Thereafter 77 19 96 Total $ 124 $ 115 $ (11 ) $ 228 (1) Amount includes an $84 million financing obligation, which we have recorded in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, related to our corporate headquarters lease. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2017, other than the items discussed above, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are parties to regulatory and legal matters. These matters may relate to claims involving alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, defamation, taxes, regulatory compliance and other claims. Periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company does not believe that the final disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the business. However, the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from our estimates. Moreover, such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, divert management's attention from the Company's business 53 objectives and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There may also be claims or actions pending or threatened against us of which we are currently not aware a nd the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on us. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into United States tax law. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering corporate income tax rates, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The 2017 Tax Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. Certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, including $67 million of Transition Tax, and $6 million recorded for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, are reflected in our financial results in accordance with SAB 118, which provides for a measurement period to complete the accounting for certain elements of the tax reform. We are also under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period for which that determination is made. By virtue of previously filed consolidated income tax returns filed with Expedia, we are currently under an IRS audit for the 2009, 2010, and short-period 2011 tax years, and have various ongoing state income tax audits. We are separately under examination by the IRS for the short-period 2011, 2012 and 2013 tax years and have commenced an employment tax audit with the IRS for the 2013 and 2014 tax years. These audits include questioning of the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. These examinations may lead to proposed or ordinary course adjustments to our taxes. We are no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2009. As of December 31, 2017, no material assessments have resulted, except as noted below regarding our 2009 and 2010 IRS audit with Expedia. In January 2017, as part of the Company IRS audit of Expedia, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. These proposed adjustments are related to certain transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries, and would result in an increase to our worldwide income tax expense in an estimated range of $10 million to $14 million after consideration of competent authority relief, exclusive of interest and penalties. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and we intend to defend our position through applicable administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies. Our policy is to review and update tax reserves as facts and circumstances change. Based on our interpretation of the regulations and available case law, we believe the position we have taken with regard to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries is sustainable. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2009 and 2010 transactions, if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we would be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Additionally, we continue to accumulate positive cash flows in foreign jurisdictions, which we consider indefinitely reinvested, although we will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our capital deployment within and outside the U.S. Any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and incremental cash tax payments. Refer to Note 10 Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, potential contingencies surrounding current audits by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities, and other income tax matters. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions For information on our relationships with Expedia and Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. refer to Note 16 Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 54 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that management use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, where applicable and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time management was making the estimate; and/or Changes in the estimate or different estimates that management could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for an overview of our significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements. A discussion of information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates is below. Income Taxes We record income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider all relevant factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as assessing available tax planning strategies. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheet. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into United States tax law. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering corporate income tax rates, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The 2017 Tax Act permanently reduces the U.S. 55 corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a f lat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for a Transition Tax, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, including additional limitations on executive compensation. Under GAAP, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued SAB 118, which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. The measurement period is deemed to have ended earlier when the registrant has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting. During the measurement period, impacts of the law are expected to be recorded at the time a reasonable estimate for all or a portion of the effects can be made, and provisional amounts can be recognized and adjusted as information becomes available, prepared, or analyzed. SAB 118 summarizes a three-step process to be applied at each reporting period to account for and qualitatively disclose: (1) the effects of the change in tax law for which accounting is complete; (2) provisional amounts (or adjustments to provisional amounts) for the effects of the tax law where accounting is not complete, but that a reasonable estimate has been determined; and (3) a reasonable estimate cannot yet be made and therefore taxes are reflected in accordance with law prior to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. Our financial results, including an estimate of $67 million of Transition Tax, and $6 million recorded due to a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, reflect provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under GAAP is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined. The Company has not obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its computations and accounting for the Transition Tax. Since there is ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting of the Transition Tax, deferred tax remeasurements, and other items to be provisional due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. Other significant provisions that are not yet effective but may impact income taxes in future years include: an exemption from U.S. tax on dividends of future foreign earnings, limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, an incremental tax (base erosion anti-abuse tax or BEAT ) on excessive amounts paid to foreign related parties, deductions related to foreign derived intangible income, and a minimum tax on certain foreign earnings in excess of 10 percent of the foreign subsidiaries tangible assets (i.e., global intangible low-taxed income or GILTI ). We are still evaluating whether to make a policy election to treat the GILTI tax as a period expense or to provide U.S. deferred taxes on foreign temporary differences that are expected to generate GILTI income when they reverse in future years. Refer to Note 10 Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on income taxes. Recognition and Recoverability of Goodwill, Definite-Lived Intangibles, and Other Long-Term Assets We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and assumed liabilities be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer and supplier relationships, acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Valuations are performed by management or third party valuation specialists under management's supervision, where appropriate. We assess goodwill, which is not amortized, for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 56 business comb ination as of the acquisition date. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition and becomes identified with the reporting unit in its entirety. Accordingly, the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is available to support the recoverability of its goodwill. The Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we generally first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Periodically, we may choose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis to assist in our annual evaluation. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, such as the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition to establish an updated baseline quantitative analysis. During a qualitative assessment, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, we determine that it is more likely than not that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount, we then perform a quantitative assessment and compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the goodwill impairment is measured using the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting unit, however, any loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In determining the estimated fair values of reporting units in a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we generally use a blend, of the following recognized valuation methods: the income approach (discounted cash flows model) and the market valuation approach, which we believe compensates for the inherent risks of using either model on a stand-alone basis. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit; income tax rates and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business and other precedent transactions. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and/or income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Valuations are performed by management or third party valuation specialists under management's supervision, where appropriate. We believe that the estimated fair values assigned to our reporting units in impairment tests are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments could trigger the need for an impairment charge, or materially increase or decrease the amount of any such impairment charge. During the Company's annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2017, a qualitative assessment for all our reporting units' goodwill was performed. For fiscal year 2017, we determined the fair value of all our reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment charges during the year ending December 31, 2017. As part of our qualitative assessment for our 2017 goodwill impairment analysis of our reporting units, the factors that we considered included, but were not limited to: (a) changes in macroeconomic conditions in the overall economy and the specific markets in which we operate, (b) our ability to access capital, (c) changes in the online travel industry, (d) changes in the level of competition, (e) evaluation of current and future forecasted financial results of the reporting units, (f) comparison of our current financial performance to historical and budgeted results of the reporting units, (g) change in excess of the Company market capitalization over its book value, factoring in the decline in the Company stock price during 2017, (h) changes in estimates, valuation inputs, and/or assumptions since the last quantitative analysis of the reporting units, (i) changes in the regulatory environment; and (j) changes in strategic outlook or organizational structure and leadership of the reporting units, and how these factors might impact specific performance in future periods. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. 57 We also periodically review the carrying amount of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-term assets, including property and equipment and website and internal use software, to determine whether current e vents or circumstances indicate that such carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we assess the recoverability of the asset g roup by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset of the group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash f lows, using an appropriate discount rate. Any impairment would be measured by the amount that the carrying values, of such asset groups, exceed their fair value and would be included in operating income on the consolidated statement of operations. Consider able management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of asset groups. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. We have not identified any circumstances that would warrant an impairment charge for any recorded de finite lived or other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017.
