OVERVIEW We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and professional service providers. Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. As of December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores in 38 states. Operating within the retail industry, we, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact our Company and the retail sector in general. We cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. We believe that the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, average vehicle age, new light vehicle sales, unperformed maintenance, unemployment and product quality differentiation are key drivers of current and future demand of products sold within the automotive aftermarket. Number of miles driven: Total miles driven in the U.S., along with changes in the average age of vehicles on the road, heavily influence the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell. Historically, the long-term trend in the total miles driven in the U.S. has steadily increased. According to the Department of Transportation, between 1999 and 2007, the total number of miles driven in the U.S. increased at an average annual rate of approximately 1.6%. In 2008, however, difficult macroeconomic conditions and record high gas prices during the first half of the year led to a decrease in the number of miles driven and in 2009, miles driven remained relatively flat. Through November of 2010, miles driven in the U.S. increased by 0.7% with miles driven increasing each month since March. As the U.S. economy recovers, we believe that annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to increase the demand for our products. 24 Table of Contents Number of U.S. registered vehicles and new light vehicle sales: As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ), the total number of vehicles on the road in the U.S. has exhibited steady growth over the past decade, with the total number of registered vehicles increasing 18%, from 205 million light vehicles in 2000 to 242 million in 2009. New light vehicle sales, however, have declined over the past decade. Between 2000 and 2007, new car sales in the U.S. decreased by 7%, from 17.4 million in 2000 to 16.2 million vehicles in 2007. Due to the recent difficult macroeconomic environment in the U.S., new light vehicles sales declined by 18% in 2008 to 13.2 million and declined by 21% in 2009 to 10.4 million vehicles, which is the lowest level in the past decade. Based on the current economic environment, we believe new light vehicle sales will remain below historic levels and consumers will continue to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher miles, continuing the trend of an aging vehicle population. Average vehicle age of registered vehicles: As reported by the AAIA, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased over the past decade from 9.1 years for passenger cars and 8.5 years for light trucks in 1999 to 10.6 and 9.6 years in 2009, respectively. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and built vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains, and interiors and exteriors, the decrease in new car sales over the past two years and the consumers willingness to invest in maintaining their higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for our products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures which require replacement parts and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles would require. Unperformed maintenance: According to estimates compiled by the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association, the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the U.S. totaled $54 billion for 2009 versus $50 billion for 2008. This metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed. Consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products, and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand. We believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions beginning in 2008 contributed to the increased amount of unperformed maintenance in 2009; however, with the reduced number of new car sales and consumers increased focus on maintaining their current vehicle with the expectation of keeping the vehicle longer than they would have in a better macroeconomic environment, we believe the amount of underperformed maintenance decreased in 2010, resulting in a strong year in the automotive aftermarket. Unemployment: Challenging macroeconomic conditions have lead to high levels of unemployment. Monthly U.S. unemployment rates for 2010 ranged from 9.4% to 9.9%. We believe that these unemployment rates and continued uncertainty in the overall economic health have a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. We also believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money and can be an important factor in the consumer decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle. While the deferral of vehicle purchases has lead to an increase in vehicle maintenance, long term trends of high unemployment levels could reduce the number of total annual miles driven as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending habits, both of which could negatively impact our business. Product quality differentiation: We provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good , better , and best alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products. Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. We believe that the average consumer tendency has been to trade-down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant effect on our operations and are summarized below: Since July 11, 2008, and as a result of the CSK acquisition, we have incurred and may continue to incur legal fees related to ongoing governmental investigations and indemnity obligations for the litigation that has commenced against CSK and former CSK employees. O Reilly and the DOJ have now agreed in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve the DOJ investigation of CSK legacy accounting practices. Based upon the agreement in principle for a final settlement, we have recorded a charge of $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, in anticipation of the DOJ, CSK and O Reilly executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement. 25 Table of Contents On July 11, 2008, we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of 6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the Notes ) originally issued by CSK. The Notes were exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bore interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.5% until maturity. During 2010, all holders of the Notes exercised their right to exchange and on December 21, 2010, the Notes were retired. In March of 2010, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Acts ). The provisions of the Acts are not expected to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements in the short-term. However, the potential long-term impacts of the Acts to our business and consolidated financial statements, while currently uncertain, are being evaluated by management. We will continue to assess how the Acts apply to us, their effect on our business and how we plan to best meet the stated requirements. On December 29, 2010, we completed a corporate reorganization creating a holding company structure (the Reorganization ). The Reorganization was implemented through an agreement and plan of merger under Section 351.448 of The General Corporation Law of the State of Missouri which did not require a vote of the shareholders. As a result of the Reorganization, the previous parent company and registrant O Reilly Automotive, Inc. ( Old O Reilly ) was renamed O Reilly Automotive Stores, Inc. and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent company and registrant, which was renamed O Reilly Automotive, Inc. On January 11, 2011, we announced a new Board-approved share repurchase program (the Repurchase Program ) that authorizes us to repurchase up to $500 million of shares of our common stock over a three-year period. Stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program may be made from time to time as we deem appropriate, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, and we may increase or otherwise modify the Repurchase Program at any time without prior notice. On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes ) in the public market, of which we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are the guarantors and UMB Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) is trustee. The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes bear interest at 4.875% which is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, beginning on July 14, 2011. The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes mature on July 14, 2021. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our previous credit facility, pay fees associated with the issuance and for general corporate purposes. Concurrent with the closing and issuance of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes, on January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement for a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility ( the Revolver ) arranged by Bank of America, N.A. ( BA ) and Barclays Capital ( Barclays ) and simultaneously retired our existing secured revolving credit facility. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 51.4 52.0 54.5 Gross profit 48.6 48.0 45.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 35.0 36.9 36.1 Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 0.4 0.0 0.0 Operating income 13.2 11.1 9.4 Debt prepayment costs (0.2 ) Interim facility commitment fee (0.1 ) Interest expense (0.7 ) (0.9 ) (0.7 ) Interest income 0.1 Gain on settlement of note receivable 0.2 Other income, net 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 12.8 10.3 8.5 Provision for income taxes 5.0 4.0 3.3 Net income 7.8 % 6.3 % 5.2 % 26 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales: Sales increased $550 million, or 11%, from $4.85 billion in 2009 to $5.4 billion in 2010. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009 Comparable store sales $ 417 Stores opened throughout 2009, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales 56 Sales of stores opened throughout 2010 74 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent parts stores and team members 8 Sales in 2009 for stores that have closed (5 ) Total increase in sales $ 550 Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one- to two-week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales increased 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010, versus 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers. The improvement in comparable store sales for the year was driven both by increased transaction counts and higher average ticket values. We believe that the increase in transaction counts is a result of the customer focus on better maintaining their current vehicles, the stabilization of the economy and gas prices during the year and the growth of our commercial business in the acquired CSK markets. The improvement in average ticket value is primarily the result of a larger percentage of our total sales derived from higher priced hard parts categories. Store growth: At December 31, 2010, we operated 3,570 stores compared to 3,421 stores at December 31, 2009. We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 170 net new stores in 2011 versus 149 net new stores in 2010. Gross profit: Gross profit increased $294 million, or 13%, from $2.33 billion (48.0% of sales) in 2009 to $2.62 billion (48.6% of sales) in 2010. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was the result of improved product mix, lower product acquisition costs and decreased inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percent of the total sales mix and reduced leverage on the expanded number of distribution centers. The improvement in product mix is primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories, which typically generate a higher gross margin percentage than other categories. Increasing hard part sales are the result of strong consumer demand as consumers retain their vehicles longer and our enhanced and more comprehensive inventory levels in the hard part categories in the CSK stores, supported by a more extensive and robust distribution network. Lower product acquisition costs are derived from improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as the result of large purchase volume increases associated with the acquisition of CSK. The benefit of this improvement in gross margin was realized in the first and second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same periods in 2009 when we renegotiated these vendor contracts. Our gross margin results for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 reflect comparable periods of improved purchasing leverage. The decrease in inventory shrinkage at converted CSK stores is the result of the more robust O Reilly point of sale system ( POS ), which was installed in all CSK stores when they converted to the O Reilly distribution systems. The O Reilly POS provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory resulting in improved inventory shrinkage. Commercial sales are growing at a faster rate than DIY sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in our western markets, which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy in these areas. Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross margin percentage than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional customers, and create pressure on our gross margin as a percent of sales. The reduced leverage on distribution center costs is the result of the additional distribution centers, which have been opened in conjunction with the CSK integration plan. New team members in these distribution centers are not yet fully proficient with distribution operations, resulting in inefficiencies. We believe that the long term impact of the improved 27 Table of Contents negotiating leverage with our vendors will allow us to generate gross margins at levels comparable to our 2010 full year results going forward, however continued growth in our commercial sales, as a percent of the total sales mix, will continue to pressure our gross margin results in the future. Selling, general and administrative expenses: SG&A increased approximately $100 million, or 6%, from $1.79 billion (36.9% of sales) in 2009 to $1.89 billion (35.0% of sales) in 2010. The increase in total SG&A dollars is primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count and dual market strategy in the acquired CSK stores, as well as increased incentive compensation for team members resulting from strong comparable store sales. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased leverage of fixed costs on very strong comparable store sales levels. Operating income: Operating income increased $175 million, or 33%, from $538 million (11.1% of sales) in 2009 to $713 million (13.2% of sales) in 2010. The increase in operating income is the result of increased sales and gross profit, offset by the increased SG&A discussed above as well as a $21 million charge related to the legacy DOJ investigation of CSK as discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 14 Legal Matters to the consolidated financial statements. The increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed SG&A costs from strong comparable store sales. This full-year operating income as a percentage of sales represents a record high for the Company, and we would anticipate these operating levels to be sustainable. Other income and expense: Interest expense decreased $6 million, from $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) in 2009 to $39 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2010. The decrease in interest expense during 2010 as compared to 2009 is the result of a lower level of average outstanding borrowings under our secured asset-backed credit facility ( Credit Facility ). Included as a component of Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010, is a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes increased $81 million from $189 million (38.1% effective tax rate) in 2009 to $270 million (39.2% effective tax rate) in 2010. The increase in our provision for income taxes is due to the increase in our taxable income. The increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation of $21 million which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $112 million, or 36%, from $307 million (6.3% of sales) in 2009 to $419 million (7.8% of sales) in 2010. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 32% to $2.95 on 142 million shares compared to $2.23 for the year ended December 31, 2009, on 138 million shares. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our year-to-date results include a nonrecurring charge related to the ongoing, legacy DOJ investigation of CSK as well as a nonrecurring, non-operating gain in other income related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired from CSK. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of the charge related to the DOJ investigation of CSK, increased 37% to $734 million (13.6% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $538 million (11.1% of sales) for the same period in 2009. Adjusted net income, excluding the impact of the charge related to the DOJ investigation of CSK and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable increased 41% to $433 million (8.0% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $307 million (6.3% of sales) for the same period in 2009. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, excluding the impact of the charge related to the DOJ investigation of CSK and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable, increased 37% to $3.05 for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $2.23 for the same period in 2009. 28 Table of Contents The table below outlines the impact of the charge and the gain for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009 (amounts in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales Operating income $ 712,776 13.2 % $ 537,619 11.1 % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 0.4 % % Adjusted operating income $ 733,676 13.6 % $ 537,619 11.1 % Net income $ 419,373 7.8 % $ 307,498 6.3 % Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 0.4 % % Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (7,215 ) (0.2 )% % Adjusted net income $ 433,058 8.0 % $ 307,498 6.3 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.95 $ 2.23 Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 0.15 Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (0.05 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 3.05 $ 2.23 The financial information presented in the table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These items include adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the CSK DOJ investigation charge and the gain on the settlement of the CSK note receivable provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. The material limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that such measures are not reflective of actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for this limitation by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 2009 Compared to 2008 Sales: Sales increased $1.27 billion, or 36%, from $3.58 billion in 2008 to $4.85 billion in 2009. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008 Comparable store sales $ 189 Stores opened throughout 2008, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable stores sales 72 Sales of stores opened throughout 2009 73 Non-store sales including machinery, sales to independent part stores and team members 4 Sales in 2008 for stores that have merged or closed (2 ) Acquired CSK store sales, excluding sales that are included in comparable store sales (sales after 7/11/2009, the one year anniversary of the acquisition) 935 Total increase in sales $ 1,271 Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one-to-two week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the O Reilly systems increased 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The O Reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a 6.6% increase for the core O Reilly and post conversion Schuck stores, a 2.1% increase from the 123 converted Checker stores and a 11.9% decrease in comparable 29 Table of Contents stores sales from the 141 converted Murray stores. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy CSK system increased 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Consolidated comparable store sales increased 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009, versus 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. We believe that the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of the stores, compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional service providers. The improvement in comparable store sales was primarily driven by an increase in transaction counts, while average ticket remained flat with the prior year. The flat average ticket value was attributable to more complex and costly repair parts, consistent with ongoing industry trends offset by competitive price reductions in the acquired CSK stores and the addition of a wider assortment of entry level products in those stores. Store growth: We opened 149 new O Reilly branded stores and one new Schuck store in 2009. At December 31, 2009, we operated 3,421 stores compared to 3,285 stores at December 31, 2008. Due to the acquisition and integration of CSK, we anticipate new store unit growth to be limited to 150 new stores in 2010, excluding the previously disclosed consolidation and closure of underperforming stores related to the acquisition of CSK; however, we anticipate that continued store unit growth consistent with our historical openings will continue in the future. Gross profit: Gross profit increased $699 million, or 43%, from $1.63 billion (45.5% of sales) in 2008 to $2.33 billion (48.0% of sales) in 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2009 versus roughly one half of a year of sales from acquired CSK stores in 2008, the increase in sales from new stores and an increase in comparable store sales from existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of lower product acquisition cost, changes in our product mix, distribution system improvements and a favorable pricing environment on certain commodity based products. Product acquisition costs improved primarily due to continued negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth related to the acquisition of CSK. We anticipate continued improvements in product acquisition costs at a moderate rate in 2010 from a full year of the benefit from improved leverage with our vendors as we anniversary product line changeovers in the acquired CSK stores throughout the year. We improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store market and through ongoing Team Member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution. Additionally, gross margin percentage improved as a result of an increased percentage of our total sales mix to DIY customers. Prior to the acquisition of CSK, our mix of sales to DIY customers was approximately equal to sales to professional service provider customers. At the time of the acquisition in July of 2008, acquired CSK stores generated more than 90% of their total sales from DIY customers. The addition of the acquired CSK stores predominantly retail sales has resulted in a mix shift of our consolidated sales to approximately 65% DIY and 35% professional service provider. In 2009, core O Reilly stores derived approximately 53% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 47% from our professional service provider customers, while acquired CSK stores derived approximately 84% of sales from our DIY customers and approximately 16% from our professional service provider customers. Sales to DIY customers generally have higher gross margin percentages than sales to professional service providers as volume discounts are granted on these wholesale transactions to professional service providers. In addition, we have added our private label product lines to the acquired CSK stores inventory mix. Private label product sales generally offer better gross margin percentages than sales of corresponding branded products. Improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies. The reductions in commodity prices, without corresponding decreases in retail pricing, that we experienced in 2009 returned to more normal levels by the end of 2009 and we would not anticipate this favorable pricing environment to continue in 2010. Additionally, in conjunction with the opening of our distribution centers ( DC ) in our western markets, we would anticipate a temporary decrease in distribution efficiencies as the new DC team members become proficient with the O Reilly distribution systems and as duplicative capacity is removed from the system. Selling, general and administrative expense: SG&A increased $497 million, or 38%, from $1.29 billion (36.1% of sales) in 2008 to $1.79 billion (36.9% of sales) in 2009. The dollar increase in SG&A expenses resulted from a full year inclusion of CSK and new stores. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the addition of the acquired CSK stores, which have a higher expense structure than the core O Reilly store base, and the additional store payroll required to complete the ongoing product-line changeovers for acquired CSK stores. These increases were offset by a reduction in duplicative administrative corporate overhead as we continue to transition the CSK headquarters operations in Phoenix, Arizona to our facilities in Springfield, Missouri and increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the increase in comparable store sales. Operating income: Operating income in 2009 increased $202 million, or 60%, from $336 million (or 9.4% of sales) in 2008 to $538 million (or 11.1% of sales) in 2009, representing an increase of 60%. 30 Table of Contents Interest expense: Interest expense increased $19 million, from $26 million (or 0.7% of sales) in 2008 to $45 million (or 0.9% of sales) in 2009. The increase in interest expense is the result of a full-year of borrowings under our Credit Facility in 2009 that was used to fund the acquisition of CSK in 2008, the opening of new stores, ongoing capital expenditures related to the integration of the operations of CSK, the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and the operation of our existing stores slightly offset by more favorable interest rates in 2009 on the non-swapped portion of the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility which are subject to variable interest rate changes. Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time charges of $4 million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the CSK acquisition and $7 million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes increased from $116 million in 2008 (38.4% effective tax rate) to $189 million in 2009 (38.1% effective tax rate). The decrease in effective tax rate is the result of the one-time charge to adjust tax liabilities in 2008 relating to the CSK acquisition, offset by the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where CSK stores are located. The increase in the dollar amount for income taxes was due to the increase in income before income taxes. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income increased $121 million, or 65%, from $186 million in 2008 (5.2% of sales) to $307 million in 2009 (6.3% of sales). Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 51% to $2.23 on 138 million shares compared to $1.48 for the year ended December 31, 2008, on 125 million shares. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time and non-cash charges related to the July 11, 2008, acquisition of CSK. These charges included one-time costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt, commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility, a one-time adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of CSK, a one-time charge to conform the CSK team member vacation policy with the O Reilly policy and a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK trade names and trademarks, which will be amortized over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of CSK store locations. Our year ended December 31, 2009, results included a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK trade names and trademarks. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges, increased 38% to $2.26 for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1.64 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales Net income $ 307,498 6.3 % $ 186,232 5.2 % Acquisition related charges: Debt prepayment costs, net of tax % 4,402 0.1 % Commitment fee for interim financing facility, net of tax % 2,552 0.1 % Adjustments to tax liabilities % 3,142 0.1 % Charge to conform vacation policies, net of tax % 5,879 0.1 % Amortization of trade names and trademarks, net of tax 3,894 0.1 % 3,267 0.1 % Adjusted net income $ 311,392 6.4 % $ 205,474 5.7 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.23 $ 1.48 Acquisition related charges: Debt prepayment costs, net of tax 0.04 Commitment fee for interim financing facility, net of tax 0.02 Adjustments to tax liabilities 0.02 Charge to conform vacation policies, net of tax 0.05 Amortization of trade names and trademarks, net of tax 0.03 0.03 Adjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 2.26 $ 1.64 The acquisition-related adjustments to EPS in the above paragraph and table present certain financial information not derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and earnings per share excluding acquisition-related charges provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company ongoing core operations. Management excludes these items in judging our performance and believes this 31 Table of Contents non-GAAP information is useful to gain an understanding of the recurring factors and trends affecting our business. Material limitations of this non-GAAP measure are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts and amortization of acquisition-related trade names and trademarks reflect charges to net income and earnings per share that will recur over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from one to three years. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, as well as our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in millions): Year Ended Liquidity and Related Ratios December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Percentage Change Current assets $ 2,301 $ 2,227 3.3 % Quick assets (1) 213 198 7.6 % Current liabilities 1,229 1,219 0.8 % Working capital (2) 1,072 1,008 6.3 % Total debt 359 791 (54.6 )% Total equity $ 3,210 $ 2,686 19.5 % Current ratio (3) 1.87:1 1.83:1 2.2 % Quick ratio (4) 0.23:1 0.26:1 (11.5 )% Debt to equity (5) 0.11 0.29 (62.1 )% Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio (6) 1.6:1 2.4:1 (33.3 )% Year Ended Liquidity December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 703,687 $ 285,200 $ 298,542 Investing activities (351,277 ) (410,661 ) (367,597 ) Financing activities (349,624 ) 121,095 52,801 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,786 $ (4,366 ) $ (16,254 ) (1) Quick assets include cash, cash equivalents and receivables. (2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (3) Current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. (4) Quick ratio is calculated as current assets, less inventories, divided by current liabilities. (5) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total shareholders equity. (6) Adjusted debt is calculated as the sum of debt, letters of credit and six-times rent, less the premium on exchangeable notes. Adjusted EBITDAR is calculated as the sum of net income, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rent expense and stock option compensation expense, less the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation and the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of the CSK note receivable, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Liquidity and related ratios: Our working capital increased 6% from 2009 to 2010, primarily driven by an increased investment in hard parts inventories in the acquired CSK stores as we continue to grow and expand the professional service provider business in those markets as well as the additional net inventory investment required by our new store growth. Total debt decreased 55% and total equity increased 20% from 2009 to 2010. The decrease in total debt was driven by strong cash flow from operations which allowed us to substantially pay down the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility. The increase in total equity was due to increased retained earnings resulting from strong net income in 2010 and an increase in additional paid-in capital, primarily from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefits as well as the impact of share based compensation. Operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $704 million in 2010, $285 million in 2009 and $299 million in 2008. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in net income (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, gain/loss on property and equipment, deferred income taxes and stock based compensation charges), a significant decrease in net inventory investment and an increase in other liabilities as compared to the same period in 2009. Net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. The decrease in net inventory investment in 2010 as compared to 2009 is the result of the significant investments in 2009 to improve the 32 Table of Contents inventory availability in the acquired CSK stores. Although our investment in net inventory decreased year over year in 2010, duplicative and excess inventory levels throughout our distribution network have lead to an increase in per store average inventory. The average per-store inventory for our stores increased to $0.57 million as of December 31, 2010, from $0.56 million as of December 31, 2009. The increase in other liabilities is principally due to the accrual of the CSK DOJ investigation charge during 2010 which is expected to be paid in 2011. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was principally due to an increase in net inventory investment in 2009 as discussed above, which was slightly offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses. The average per-store inventory for our stores increased to $0.56 million as of December 31, 2009, from $0.48 million as of December 31, 2008 as we made significant investments in the acquired CSK stores in 2009 to improve the inventory availability. During 2011, we will continue to refine the inventory levels in the acquired CSK stores and will focus on returning excess quantities to vendors where appropriate and selling through the remainder of the excess quantities on hand in the stores. Investing activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $351 million in 2010, $411 million in 2009 and $368 million in 2008. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is principally due to a decrease in capital expenditures associated with the integration of CSK and an increase in payments received on notes receivable. Capital expenditures were $365 million in 2010, $415 million in 2009, and $342 million in 2008. Capital expenditures related to the acquisition of CSK include the purchase of properties for DCs and costs associated with the conversion of CSK stores to the O Reilly Brand. Although we opened four new DCs in 2010, a significant portion of the capital expenditures for these DCs occurred in 2009 as we acquired property and began construction of the facilities. The increase in payments received on notes receivable was due to the one-time nonrecurring payment received to settle the note receivable acquired from CSK. Increases in cash used in investing activities in both 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to the conversions of acquired CSK stores to the O Reilly Brand and the properties and facilities for the additional DCs. We opened 149 net new stores in 2010 and 150 net new stores in both 2009 and 2008. We plan to open 170 net new stores in 2011. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $1.4 million to $1.6 million; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $350 million in 2010, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $121 million in 2009 and $53 million in 2008. Net cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 is driven by the increase in net repayments of outstanding borrowings on our long-term debt. The repayments in 2010 were funded by increased cash provided by operating activities as well as decreased capital expenditures compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of an increase in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our stock option plans and the associated tax benefit from the exercises. Sources of liquidity: Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, to complete the conversions of the acquired CSK stores, expand distribution infrastructure and operate existing stores. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our Revolver. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our Revolver. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolver will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Credit facilities: On July 11, 2008, in connection with the acquisition of CSK, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year $1.2 billion secured credit facility arranged by BA (the Credit Facility ), which we used to refinance debt, fund the cash portion of the acquisition, pay for other transaction-related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined Company going forward. This Credit Facility replaced a previous unsecured, five-year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million. The Credit Facility was comprised of a $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility and a $125.0 million first-in-last-out revolving credit facility ( FILO tranche ). On the date of the transaction, the amount of the borrowing base available, as described in the credit agreement, under the Credit Facility was $1.05 billion of which we borrowed $588 million. We used borrowings under the Credit Facility to repay certain existing debt of CSK, repay our $75 million 2006-A Senior Notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility. The terms of the Credit Facility granted us the right to terminate the FILO tranche upon meeting certain requirements, including no events of default and aggregate projected availability under the Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we elected to exercise our right to terminate the FILO tranche. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of the borrowing base available under the Credit Facility was $1.071 billion and $1.196 billion, respectively, of which we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million and $679 million, respectively. The available borrowings under the Credit Facility were also reduced by stand-by letters of credit issued by us primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had stand-by letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $71 million and $72 million, respectively, and the aggregate availability for additional borrowings under 33 Table of Contents the Credit Facility was $644 million and $445 million, respectively. As part of the Credit Facility, we had pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral and we were subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant, with which we complied as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, borrowings under the tranche A revolver bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either a base rate plus 1.00% per annum or LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum, with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. The base rate was equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by BA from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 0.50%. Fees related to unused capacity under the Credit Facility were assessed at a rate of 0.50% of the remaining available borrowings under the facility, subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity. In addition, we paid customary commitment fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the Credit Facility. All outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were repaid in conjunction with the issuance of our 2011 4.875% Senior Notes on January 14, 2011, as further discussed below. On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver ) arranged by BA and Barclays, which matures in January of 2016. The Revolver includes a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. Our ability to draw under the revolving facility is conditioned upon, among other things, our ability to certify that the representations and warranties contained in the credit agreement are true, correct and complete in all material respects and that no event of default has occurred or would result from the proposed extension of credit. Borrowings under the Revolver (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 1.325% to 2.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.325% to 1.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services. Swing line loans made under the Revolver bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we will pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.175% to 0.500% based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services. The Revolver replaced the secured Credit Facility we entered into on July 11, 2008. 6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Senior Notes: On July 11, 2008, we executed the Third Supplemental Indenture (the Third Supplemental Indenture ) to the 6 3 / 4 % Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the Notes ), in which we agreed to become a guarantor, on a subordinated basis, of the $100 million principal amount of the Notes originally issued by CSK pursuant to an Indenture dated as of December 19, 2005, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 30, 2005, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 27, 2006, by and between CSK Auto Corporation, CSK Auto, Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. On December 31, 2008, and effective as of July 11, 2008, we entered into the Fourth Supplemental Indenture in order to correct the definition of Exchange Rate in the Third Supplemental Indenture. The Notes were exchangeable, under certain circumstances, into cash and shares of our common stock. The Notes bore interest at 6.75% per year until December 15, 2010, and 6.50% until maturity on December 15, 2025. Prior to their stated maturity, these Notes were exchangeable by the holder only under the following circumstances (as more fully described in the indenture under which the Notes were issued): during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) commencing after July 11, 2008, if the last reported sale price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange price of $36.17 for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; if the Notes had been called for redemption by us; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as a change in control. On July 1, 2010, the Notes became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through September 30, 2010, the last trading day of our third quarter, as provided for in the indentures governing the Notes. The Notes became exchangeable as our common stock closed at or above 130% of the Exchange Price (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes) for 20 trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on June 30, 2010. As a result, during the exchange period commencing July 1, 2010, and continuing through and including September 30, 2010, for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes held, holders of the Notes could, if they elected, surrender their Notes for exchange. If the Notes were exchanged, we would deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and, in the event our total exchange obligation exceeded the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged, shares of our common stock in respect of that excess. The total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each $1,000 in principal amount of the Notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of approximately 25.97 shares of our common stock and approximately $60.61 in cash. On September 28, 2010, certain holders of the Notes delivered notice to the exchange agent to exercise their right to exchange $11 million of the principal amount of the Notes. The Cash Settlement Averaging Period (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes) ended on October 27, 2010, and on October 29, 2010, we delivered $11 million in cash, which represented the principal amount of the Notes exchanged and the value of partial shares, and 92,855 shares of our common stock to the exchange agent in settlement of the exchange obligation. Concurrently, we retired the $11 million principal amount of the exchanged Notes. On October 1, 2010, the Notes again became exchangeable at the option of the holders and remained exchangeable through December 31, 2010. 34 Table of Contents The Noteholders had the option to require us to repurchase some or all of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on December 15, 2010; December 15, 2015; or December 15, 2020, or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture. We had the option to redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after December 15, 2010, upon at least 35-calendar days notice. On November 15, 2010, we announced our intention to redeem the Notes on December 21, 2010, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. On or prior to December 17, 2010, the remaining holders of the Notes delivered notice to the exchange agent to exercise their right to exchange the $89 million remaining principal amount of the Notes. The Cash Settlement Averaging Period (as defined in the indentures governing the Notes) ended on December 16, 2010, and on December 21, 2010, we delivered $89 million in cash, which represented the principal amount of the Notes exchanged and the value of partial shares, and 939,312 shares of our common stock to the exchange agent in settlement of the exchange obligation. Concurrently, we retired the $89 million principal amount of the exchanged Notes. 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 : On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value in the public market, of which certain of our subsidiaries are the guarantors, and UMB is trustee. The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes bear interest at 4.875% which is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, beginning on July 14, 2011. The 2011 4.875% Senior Notes mature on January 14, 2021. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our previous secured Credit Facility, to pay fees associated with the issuance and for general corporate purposes. Prior to October 14, 2020, the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, at our option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, equal to the greater of: 100% of the principal amount thereof; or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Yield (as defined in the indenture governing the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes) plus 25 basis points. On or after October 14, 2020, the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at our option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In addition, if we undergo a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the indenture governing the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes), holders of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the repurchase date. Debt covenants: The indenture governing the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indenture. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The new Revolver contains certain positive and negative debt covenants. These covenants include limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the Revolver, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 times from the closing through December 31, 2012, 2.25 times through December 31, 2014, and 2.50 times through maturity and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times from the closing through maturity. Our consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock option compensation expense ( EBITDAR ) to adjusted debt. Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding standby letters of credit, six times capitalized rent and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. As of January 14, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future. 35 Table of Contents Our adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio was 1.6 times and 2.4 times as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Under our current financing plan, we have a target adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of 2.0 times to 2.25 times. Twelve Months Ended December 31, (In thousands, except adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio) 2010 2009 GAAP debt $ 358,704 $ 790,748 Add: Letters of credit 71,206 72,381 Rent X 6 1,361,274 1,374,804 Less: Premium on exchangeable notes 718 Non-GAAP adjusted debt $ 1,791,184 $ 2,237,215 GAAP net income $ 419,373 $ 307,498 Legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge 20,900 Gain on settlement of note receivable, net of tax (7,215 ) Non-GAAP adjusted net income 433,058 307,498 Add: Interest expense 39,273 45,176 Taxes, net of impact of gain on settlement of note receivable 265,576 189,400 Adjusted EBIT 737,907 542,074 Add: Depreciation and amortization 161,442 148,179 Rent expense 226,879 229,134 Stock option compensation expense 14,947 13,451 Adjusted EBITDAR $ 1,141,175 $ 932,838 Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR 1.6 2.4 The adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio discussed in the paragraph and presented in the table above is not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). We do not, and nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the CSK DOJ investigation charge, the gain from the settlement of the note receivable, and the presentation of EBITDAR provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of this non-GAAP measure are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost-effective alternative to our existing sources of cash. We do not believe, however, that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans. On December 29, 2000, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with an unrelated party. Under the terms of the transaction, we sold 90 properties, including land, buildings and improvements, which generated $52.3 million of cash. The lease, which is being accounted for as an operating lease, provides for an initial lease term of 21 years and may be extended for one initial ten-year period and two additional successive periods of five years each. The resulting gain of $4.5 million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term. Net rent expense during the initial term is approximately $5.3 million annually. In August 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback with O Reilly-Wooten, 2001 LLP (an entity owned by certain affiliates of the Company). The transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine O Reilly Auto Parts stores and generated approximately $5.6 million of cash. The transaction did not result in a material gain or loss. The lease, which has been accounted for as an operating lease, calls for an initial term of 15 years with three five-year renewal options. We issued stand-by letters of credit provided by a $200 million sub limit under the Credit Facility that reduced our available borrowings. Those letters of credit were issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit had a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $71.2 million and $72.3 million were outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 36 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Deferred income taxes and commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2011, which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, included commitments for future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are summarized in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 4 Long-Term Debt and Note 6 Commitments to the consolidated financial statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolver.

At December 31, 2009, we had borrowings of $279 million under our Credit Facility, which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement, with interest rates ranging from 2.50% to 4.50%. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred interest expense of $16 million and $23 million, respectively, as a result of borrowings under our secured Credit Facility, which were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement. See Note 4 Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information. (2) On January 14, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement for a five-year $750 million Revolver, which matures in January of 2016. Borrowings under the Revolver (other than swing line loans) bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 1.325% to 2.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.325% to 1.500% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services. Swing line loans made under the Revolver bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.175% to 0.500% based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services. The Revolver replaced the secured Credit Facility. (3) On January 14, 2011, we issued $500 million of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes which are due on January 14, 2021. The estimated annual interest payments for the 2011 4.875% Senior Notes are expected to be approximately $24 million. The principal amount and estimated annual interest payments are not included in the above table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. (4) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. (5) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. These liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities, however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties. These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2010, we recorded a liability of $41.3 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. 37 Table of Contents Vendor concessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Self-Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and employee health care benefits. With the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities, which are limited by the design of these plans, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $10 million or 1.5% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. Accounts Receivable We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.8 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for 38 Table of Contents monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories at our stores and DCs. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $0.6 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually on December 31, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to our goodwill or intangible assets. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs, however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets is required as of December 31, 2010, nor do we believe goodwill or any other intangible assets are at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine the Company market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. Closed Property Reserves We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $2 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business as well as resolving the governmental investigations and litigation that are being conducted against CSK and certain of its former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2010, the financial impact would have been approximately $4.3 million or 0.6% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2010. 39 Table of Contents INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe our operations have been materially, adversely affected by inflation. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year. QUARTERLY RESULTS The following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal 2010 and 2009. The unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown. The unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report, and the other financial information included therein. Fiscal 2010 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data) Comparable store sales 6.9 % 7.9 % 11.1 % 9.2 % Sales $ 1,280,067 $ 1,381,241 $ 1,425,887 $ 1,310,330 Gross profit 618,347 672,633 693,415 636,597 Operating income 168,445 181,164 199,031 164,136 Gain on settlement of note receivable 11,639 Net income 97,476 99,595 116,542 105,760 Earnings per share basic 0.71 0.72 0.84 0.76 Earnings per share assuming dilution 0.70 0.71 0.82 0.74 Fiscal 2009 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (In thousands, except per share and comparable store sales data) Comparable store sales 5.7 % 4.8 % 5.3 % 2.7 % Sales $ 1,163,749 $ 1,251,377 $ 1,258,239 $ 1,173,697 Gross profit 542,670 603,769 610,555 569,534 Operating income 113,336 149,675 149,196 125,412 Net income 62,835 85,515 87,225 71,923 Earnings per share basic 0.47 0.63 0.64 0.52 Earnings per share assuming dilution 0.46 0.62 0.63 0.52 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January of 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ( ASU 2010-06 ). ASU 2010-06 amends Subtopic 820-10, requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements such as transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, as well as separate disclosures about activity relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU 2010-06 clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation and input valuation techniques. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, with the exception of the new Level 3 activity disclosures, which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The adoption of the new Level 3 guidance is required in 2011 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 40 Table of Contents
