ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and the section titled Forward-Looking Information is Subject to Risk and Uncertainty included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 ("Annual Report") for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our Company We believe that we are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products and services add value. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of Quick Response Centers ("QRCs"), we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. We employ approximately 17,000 employees in more than 50 countries as of December 31, 2018 . Our business model is significantly influenced by the capital spending of global infrastructure industries for the placement of new products into service and maintenance spending for aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes. Over the past several years, we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to drive customer investments in our offerings and use of our services to replace or repair installed products. The aftermarket portion of our business also helps provide business stability during various economic periods. The aftermarket business, which is primarily served by our network of 171 QRCs located around the globe, provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value-added services. Over the past several years, we have significantly focused on our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to drive customer investments in our offerings and use of our services to replace or repair installed base. It is generally a higher margin business compared to our original equipment business and a key component of our profitable growth strategy. Through December 31, 2018, our operations were conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"): EPD for long lead time, custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; IPD for engineered and pre-configured industrial pumps and pump systems and related products and services; and FCD for engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators and controls and related services. Our business segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a high number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications that provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint, our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively and shared leadership for operational support functions, such as research and development, marketing and supply chain. The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, Valtek, Limitorque, Durco, Argus, Edward, Valbart and Durametallic, which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. Our products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world leading engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. 28 We continue to leverage our QRC network to be positioned as near to customers as possible for service and support in order to capture valuable aftermarket business. Along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell, install and service our equipment in remote regions, it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations. We also continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products. We are focusing on our ongoing low-cost sourcing, including greater use of third-party suppliers and increasing our lower-cost, emerging market capabilities. Additionally, we continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our business segments to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands. We also remain focused on improving on-time delivery and quality, while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations, through the assistance of a focused Continuous Improvement Process ("CIP") initiative. The goal of the CIP initiative, which includes lean manufacturing, six sigma business management strategy and value engineering, is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. Over the past year we have experienced a stabilization in business and improved conditions in certain of our key markets. With continued stability in oil prices at improved levels beginning in the second half of 2017 through the middle of 2018, our large-project business is showing continued signs of recovery and we anticipate that customers will continue to invest in maintenance and short cycle equipment during 2019. During 2016 and 2017, we were challenged by broad-based capital spending declines, originating in the oil and gas industry, heightened pricing pressures and negative currency impacts caused by a stronger U.S. dollar. In the second quarter of 2018, we launched and committed resources to our Flowserve 2.0 Transformation, a program designed to transform our business model to drive operational excellence, reduce complexity, accelerate growth, expand margins, increase capital efficiency and improve organizational health . For further information regarding our Flowserve 2.0 Transformation, see Our Results of Operations below and Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. During the latter part of 2018 and in connection with the Flowserve 2.0 Transformation, we determined that there are meaningful operational synergies and benefits to combining our EPD and IPD reportable segments into one reportable segment, the Flowserve Pump Division ("FPD"). The reorganization will be effective as of January 1, 2019 and as a result, beginning in 2019 we will report a two operating segment structure, FPD and FCD, and prior periods will be retrospectively adjusted to reflect the new reportable segment structure. Our Markets The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the "Outlook for 2019 " section included below in this MD&A. Our products and services are used in several distinct industries: oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management, and several other industries, such as mining, steel and paper, that are collectively referred to as "general industries." Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment as well as planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of new capital investment depends, in turn, on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for products that rely on oil and gas, chemicals, power generation and water resource management, as well as general economic conditions. These drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior. The levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment, planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process. Sales to EPC firms and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications, as are certain sales to distributors. Project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects. The quick turnaround business, which we also refer to as "short-cycle," is defined as orders that are received from the customer (booked) and shipped generally within six months of receipt. These orders are typically for more standardized, general purpose products, parts or services. Each of our three business segments generate certain levels of this type of business. In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from a large installed base of our original equipment, which requires periodic maintenance, repair and replacement parts. We use our manufacturing platform and global network of QRCs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. In geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response, we believe customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products. However, the 29 aftermarket for standard products is competitive, as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products. As proximity of service centers, timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services, we continue to selectively expand our global QRC capabilities to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business. Oil and Gas The oil and gas industry, which represented approximately 38% of our bookings in both 2018 and 2017 , experienced an increase in capital spending in 2018 compared to the previous year. The increase was primarily due to increased broad-based maintenance and short cycle investment. Aftermarket opportunities in this industry solidified throughout 2018 due to catch up of deferred spending on our customers' repair and maintenance budgets from previous years. The outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies as well as changes in the regulatory environment. In the short-term, we believe that stable oil prices will support oil and gas upstream and mid-stream investment and we further expect increased investment in later cycle downstream projects due to emerging market growth and certain regulatory requirements, such as IMO 2020. A recovery in the overall level of spending by oil and gas companies could continue to increase demand for our aftermarket products and services. We believe the medium and long-term fundamentals for this industry remain attractive, and see a stabilized environment as the industry works through current excess supply. In addition, we believe projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth will require additional investments. With our long-standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream, mid-stream and downstream applications, along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to assist our customers in this improving environment. Chemical The chemical industry represented approximately 22% and 21% of our bookings in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The chemical industry is comprised of chemical-based and pharmaceutical products. Capital spending in 2018 increased primarily due to global economic growth and forecasted demand for chemical-based products. The aftermarket opportunities solidified throughout 2018 due to catch up of deferred spending of our customers' repair and maintenance budgets from previous years. The outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions. As global economies stabilize and unemployment conditions improve, a rise in consumer spending should follow. An increase in spending would drive greater demand for chemical-based products supporting improved levels of capital investment. We believe the chemical industry in the near-term will continue to invest in North America and Middle East capacity additions, maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will selectively invest in capital infrastructure to meet current and future indigenous demand. We believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well-positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry. Power Generation The power generation industry represented approximately 11% and 13% of our bookings in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. In 2018, the power generation industry continued to experience softness in thermal power generation capital spending in the mature and key developing markets. China continued to curtail the construction of new coal-fired power generation over the last year, while in India and southeast Asia capital investment remained in place driven by increased demand forecasts. Natural gas-fired combined cycle ( NGCC ) plants increased its share of the energy mix, driven by market prices for gas remaining low and stable (partially due to the increasing global availability of liquefied natural gas ( LNG )), low capital expenditures, and the ability of NGCC to stabilize unpredictable renewable sources. With the potential of unconventional sources of gas, the global power generation industry is forecasting an increased use of this form of fuel for power generation plants. Despite fewer new nuclear plants being constructed, nuclear power remains an important contributor to the global energy mix. We continue to support our significant installed base in the global nuclear fleet by providing aftermarket and life extension products and services. Due to our extensive history, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this ongoing source of aftermarket and new construction opportunities. Political efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have some adverse effect on thermal power investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country. However, many proposed methods of capturing and limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services. At 30 the same time, we continue to take advantage of new investments in concentrated solar power generating capacity, where our pumps, valves, and seals are uniquely positioned for both molten salt applications as well as the traditional steam cycle. We believe the long-term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth, growth of urbanization in developing markets and the increased use of electricity driven transportation. We also believe that our long-standing reputation in the power generation industry, our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods, our advancements in serving the renewable energy market and carbon capture methodologies, as well as our global service and support structure, position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry. Water Management The water management industry represented approximately 4% our bookings in both 2018 and 2017 . Water management industry activity levels increased in 2018 as worldwide demand for fresh water, water treatment and re-use, desalination and flood control continued to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems, many of which require products that we offer, particularly pumps. Capital and aftermarket spending is on the rise in developed and emerging markets with governments and private industry providing funding for critical projects. The proportion of people living in regions that find it difficult to meet water requirements is expected to double by 2025. We believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continued investments, especially in North America and developing regions. General Industries General industries represented, in the aggregate, approximately 25% and 24% of our bookings in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. General industries comprise a variety of different businesses, including mining and ore processing, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, none of which individually represented more than 5% of total bookings in 2018 and 2017 . General industries also include sales to distributors, whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve. The outlook for this group of industries is heavily dependent upon the condition of global economies and consumer confidence levels. The long-term fundamentals of many of these industries remain sound, as many of the products produced by these industries are common staples of industrialized and urbanized economies. We believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide continued business opportunities. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" and all related ASUs ("New Revenue Standard"), using the modified retrospective method for transition. For a discussion related to our adoption of the New Revenue Standard requirements refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Throughout this discussion of our results of operations, we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have calculated currency effects on operations by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods. Effective August 9, 2018, we divested two IPD locations and associated product lines, including the related assets and liabilities, which included a manufacturing facility in Germany and a related assembly facility in France. The sale was to a private company. In 2017, net sales related to the divested business totaled approximately $42 million, although the business produced an operating loss in each of the last two fiscal years. Effective July 6, 2017, we sold our FCD Vogt product line and related assets and liabilities to a privately held company. In 2016, sales related to the Vogt business totaled approximately $17 million, with earnings before interest and taxes of approximately $4 million. Effective May 2, 2017 we sold our FCD Gestra AG business to a leading provider of steam system solutions. In 2016, Gestra recorded sales of approximately $101 million with earnings before interest and taxes of approximately $17 million. Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report discusses the details of the above dispositions. 31 In the second quarter of 2018, we launched and committed resources to our Flowserve 2.0 Transformation, a program designed to transform our business model to drive operational excellence, reduce complexity, accelerate growth, expand margins, increase capital efficiency and improve organizational health , which is further discussed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We anticipate that the Flowserve 2.0 Transformation will continue to incur restructuring charges, non-restructuring charges and other related transformation expenses (such as professional services, project management and related travel and expense). For the year ended December 31, 2018 , we incurred Flowserve 2.0 Transformation related expenses of $41.2 million , primarily consisting of professional services and project management costs recorded in SG&A. We are currently evaluating the total investment in and financial benefits of the various initiatives associated with this program. In 2015, we initiated Realignment Programs that consist of both restructuring and non-restructuring charges that are further discussed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2018 the Realignment Programs are substantially complete. The total charges for Realignment Programs by segment are detailed below for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 : December 31, 2018 (Amounts in thousands) Engineered Product Division Industrial Product Division Flow Control Division Subtotal Reportable Segments Eliminations and All Other Consolidated Total Total Realignment Program Charges COS $ 34,050 $ 5,427 $ 3,221 $ 42,698 $ $ 42,698 SG&A 4,189 1,721 (294 ) 5,616 5,618 11,234 Income tax expense (1,000 ) (1,000 ) (1,000 ) Total $ 37,239 $ 7,148 $ 2,927 $ 47,314 $ 5,618 $ 52,932 December 31, 2017 (Amounts in thousands) Engineered Product Division Industrial Product Division Flow Control Division Subtotal Reportable Segments Eliminations and All Other Consolidated Total Total Realignment Program Charges COS $ 18,364 $ 13,983 $ 11,600 $ 43,947 $ $ 43,947 SG&A 7,376 11,311 2,870 21,557 5,751 27,308 Income tax expense 1,000 1,000 1,000 Total $ 26,740 $ 25,294 $ 14,470 $ 66,504 $ 5,751 $ 72,255 We anticipate a total investment in these Realignment Programs of approximately $360 million , of which we have incurred charges of $347.8 million inception to date. Based on actions under our Realignment Programs, we estimate that we have achieved cost savings of approximately $230 million as of December 31, 2018 , as compared with approximately $200 million as of December 31, 2017 . Approximately $169 million of those savings are in COS with the remainder in SG&A. The Realignment Programs are substantially complete. Bookings and Backlog 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 4,019.8 $ 3,803.9 $ 3,760.4 Backlog (at period end) 1,891.6 2,033.4 1,901.8 We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer in regards to the manufacture, delivery, and/or support of products or the delivery of service. Bookings recorded and subsequently canceled within the same fiscal period are excluded from reported bookings. Bookings of $4.0 billion in 32 2018 increase d by $215.9 million , or 5.7% , as compared with 2017 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $30 million . The increase was primarily driven by the oil and gas, general and chemical industries, partially offset by a decrease in the power generation industry. The increase was more heavily-weighted towards customer aftermarket bookings. Bookings of $3.8 billion in 2017 increased by $43.5 million, or 1.2%, as compared with 2016. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $27 million. The increase was primarily driven by the oil and gas industry, partially offset by a decrease in the power generation industry. The increase was more heavily weighted towards customer original equipment bookings. Backlog represents the aggregate value of booked but uncompleted customer orders and is influenced primarily by bookings, sales, cancellations and currency effects. Backlog of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2018 decrease d by $141.8 million , or 7.0% , as compared with December 31, 2017 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $83 million (currency effects on backlog are calculated using the change in period end exchange rates). The impact of the initial adoption of the New Revenue Standard reduced backlog by approximately $237 million on January 1, 2018. Backlog related to aftermarket orders was approximately 36% and 31% of the backlog at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. We expect to ship approximately 89% of December 31, 2018 backlog during 2019 . Backlog includes our unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations related to contracts having an original expected duration in excess of one year of approximately $450 million as discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Backlog of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017 increased by $131.6 million, or 6.9%, as compared with December 31, 2016. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $110 million. Backlog related to aftermarket orders was approximately 31% and 30% of the backlog at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expected to ship approximately 92% of December 31, 2017 backlog during 2018. Sales 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions) Sales $ 3,832.7 $ 3,660.8 $ 3,990.5 Sales in 2018 increase d by $171.9 million , or 4.7% , as compared with 2017 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $31 million . The increase was more heavily-weighted to aftermarket sales, with increased sales into North America, Asia Pacific and Africa, partially offset by decreased sales in the Middle East and Europe. The impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard increased sales by approximately $71 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Sales in 2017 decreased by $329.7 million, or 8.3%, as compared with 2016. The decrease included currency benefits of approximately $34 million. The decrease was more heavily weighted toward original equipment sales. Sales decreased into every region. Sales to international customers, including export sales from the U.S., were approximately 63% of total sales in 2018 and 64% for both 2017 and 2016 . Sales into Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMA") were approximately 32% , 36% and 35% of total sales in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Sales into Asia Pacific were approximately 20% of total sales for 2018 and 19% for both 2017 and 2016 . Sales into Latin America were approximately 6% of total sales in both 2018 and 2017 and 7% for 2016 . Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Gross profit $ 1,187.8 $ 1,089.0 $ 1,236.8 Gross profit margin 31.0 % 29.7 % 31.0 % Gross profit in 2018 increase d by $98.8 million , or 9.1% , as compared with 2017 . Gross profit margin in 2018 of 31.0% increase d from 29.7% in 2017 . The impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard had an immaterial impact on gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 . The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a $16.9 million charge for costs related to a contract to supply oil and gas platform equipment to an end user in Latin 33 America in 2017 that did not recur, revenue recognized on higher margin projects, a mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales, favorable impact of increased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and increased savings related to our Realignment Programs, partially offset by a $7.7 million charge for cost incurred related to the write-down of inventory associated with the divestiture of two IPD locations and related product lines in the second quarter of 2018. Aftermarket sales increased to approximately 50% of total sales, as compared with approximately 48% of total sales in 2017 . Gross profit in 2017 decrease d by $147.8 million , or 12.0% , as compared with 2016. Gross profit margin in 2017 of 29.7% decreased from 31.0% in 2016. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, lower margin projects that shipped from backlog and a $16.9 million charge for costs incurred related to a contract to supply oil and gas platform equipment to an end user in Latin America, partially offset by $10.9 million of charges to write down inventory in Brazil in 2016 that did not recur, a mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales and lower charges and increased savings related to our Realignment Programs. Aftermarket sales increased to approximately 48% of total sales, as compared with approximately 45% of total sales in 2016. SG&A 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) SG&A $ 943.7 $ 901.7 $ 965.4 SG&A as a percentage of sales 24.6 % 24.6 % 24.2 % SG&A in 2018 increase d by $42.0 million , or 4.7% , as compared with 2017 . Currency effects yielded an increase of approximately $7 million . In 2018 , SG&A as a percentage of sales remained relatively unchanged as compared with 2017 . SG&A was favorably impacted by increased sales leverage, a $26.0 million impairment charge related to our manufacturing facility in Brazil in 2017 that did not recur, lower stock-based compensation expense, lower bad debt expense and lower charges and increased savings related to our Realignment Programs. These favorable cost impacts were substantially offset by charges related to the Flowserve 2.0 Transformation program, implementation costs associated with our adoption of the New Revenue Standard, increased accrued broad-based annual incentive compensation expense and an impairment charge of $9.7 million related to the long-lived assets associated with the divestiture of two IPD locations and related product lines in the second quarter of 2018. SG&A in 2017 decreased by $63.7 million , or 6.6% , as compared with 2016. Currency effects yielded an increase of approximately $6 million. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2017 increased 40 basis points as compared with 2016 due to a $26.0 million impairment charge related to our manufacturing facility in Brazil, increased accrued broad-based annual incentive compensation and lower sales leverage, partially offset by the $73.5 million reserve established for our primary Venezuelan customer in 2016 that did not recur and savings related to our Realignment Programs. (Loss) Gain on Sale of Businesses 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions) (Loss) gain on sale of businesses $ (7.7 ) $ 141.3 $ (7.7 ) The loss on sale of businesses in 2018 of $7.7 million resulted from the divestiture of two IPD locations and related product lines. The gain on sale of businesses in 2017 was the result of the $141.3 million gain from the sales of the Gestra and Vogt businesses. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on these sales. The $7.7 million loss in 2016 resulted from the sale of a non-strategic foundry business. Net Earnings from Affiliates 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions) Net earnings from affiliates $ 11.1 $ 12.6 $ 12.9 34 Net earnings from affiliates represents our net income from investments in seven joint ventures ( one located in each of Chile, India, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates and two in China ) that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Net earnings from affiliates in 2018 decrease d by $1.5 million , or 11.9% , as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of decreased earnings of our EPD joint venture in South Korea. Net earnings from affiliates in 2017 remained relatively constant compared to the prior year. Operating Income 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Operating income $ 247.5 $ 341.1 $ 276.7 Operating income as a percentage of sales 6.5 % 9.3 % 6.9 % Operating income in 2018 decrease d by $93.6 million , or 27.4% , as compared with 2017 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $2 million . The decrease was primarily a result of the $141.3 million gain from the sales of the Gestra and Vogt businesses in 2017 that did not recur, the $42.0 million increase in SG&A and the loss of $7.7 million from the divestiture of two IPD locations and related product lines, partially offset by the $98.8 million increase in gross profit discussed above. Operating income in 2017 increased by $64.4 million , or 23.3% , as compared with 2016. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $2 million. The increase was primarily a result of the $141.3 million pre-tax gain from the sales of the Gestra and Vogt businesses and the $63.7 million decrease in SG&A, partially offset by the $147.8 million decrease in gross profit discussed above. Interest Expense and Interest Income 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions) Interest expense $ (58.2 ) $ (59.7 ) $ (60.1 ) Interest income 6.5 3.4 2.8 Interest expense in 2018 decrease d by $1.5 million as compared with 2017 . The decrease was primarily attributable to lower borrowings in 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017. Interest expense in 2017 decreased by $0.4 million as compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. Interest income in 2018 increase d by $3.1 million as compared with 2017 . The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to higher average cash balances compared with 2017. Interest income in 2017 increased by $0.6 million as compared with 2016. Other Expense, net 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions) Other expense, net $ (19.6 ) $ (21.8 ) $ (6.4 ) Other expense, net decrease d $2.2 million as compared to 2017 , due to a $6.4 million decrease in net periodic benefit costs for pensions and post retirement obligations, partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in losses from foreign exchange contracts. The net change in transactions in currencies and foreign exchange contracts was primarily due to the foreign currency exchange rate movements in the Euro, Indian rupee, Mexican peso and Argentinian peso in relation to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2018 , as compared with the same period in 2017. Other expense, net increased $15.4 million in 2017, due primarily to a $13.2 million increase in losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites' functional currencies and a $3.6 million increase in losses from foreign exchange contracts. The net change was primarily due to the foreign currency exchange rate movements in the Mexican peso, Euro, Brazilian real and British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared with the same period in 2016. 35 Tax Expense and Tax Rate 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 51.2 $ 258.7 $ 77.4 Effective tax rate 29.0 % 98.4 % 36.3 % On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Reform Act , which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Reform Act , among other things, lowered the Company U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while imposing a deemed repatriation tax on deferred foreign income and implementing a modified territorial tax system. The Tax Reform Act also provides for a one-time transition tax on certain foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017 as well as prospective changes which began in 2018, including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, capitalization of research and development expenditures, additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest. The Tax Reform Act also provides for two new anti-base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI ) provision and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax ( BEAT ) provision which effectively creates a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The 2018 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, including losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was provided. Our effective tax rate of 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased from 98.4% in 2017 due to a change in the U.S. statutory tax rate for 2018, taxation of previously unremitted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 imposed as a result of the Tax Reform Act that did not reoccur in 2018, and the net impact of foreign operations. The 2017 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impacts pursuant to enactment of the Tax Reform Act , the net impact of foreign operations, the establishment of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in various foreign jurisdictions, primarily Germany and Mexico, and taxes related to the sale of the Gestra and Vogt businesses. The 2016 tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, tax impacts from our Realignment Programs and losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was provided. Our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location. Changes in any of these and other factors, including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits, could impact the tax rate in future periods. As of December 31, 2018, we have foreign tax credits of $16.1 million , expiring in 2026 and 2028 tax years, against which we recorded a valuation allowance of $16.1 million . Additionally, we have recorded other net deferred tax assets of $44.7 million , which relate to net operating losses, tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods, most of which do not have a definite expiration. Should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses, our effective tax rate would increase. Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation $ 119.7 $ 2.7 $ 132.5 Net earnings per share diluted $ 0.91 $ 0.02 $ 1.01 Average diluted shares 131.3 131.4 131.0 Net earnings in 2018 increase d by $117.0 million to $119.7 million , or to $0.91 per diluted share, as compared with 2017 . The increase was primarily attributable to a $207.5 million decrease in tax expense, a $2.2 million decrease in other expense net, and a $1.5 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in operating income of $93.6 million . Net earnings in 2017 decreased by $129.8 million to $2.7 million, or to $0.02 per diluted share, as compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $181.3 million increase in tax expense and a $18.4 million increase in other expense, partially offset by a $67.4 million increase in operating income and a $0.4 million decrease in interest expense. 36 Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions) Other comprehensive (loss) income $ (67.8 ) $ 119.8 $ (85.8 ) Other comprehensive loss in 2018 increase d by $187.6 million to $67.8 million from income of $119.8 million in 2017 . The loss was primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting primarily from exchange rate movements of the Euro, Argentinian peso, Indian rupee and British pound versus the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2018 as compared with 2017 . For a discussion related to hyperinflation in Argentina, refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Other comprehensive income in 2017 increased by $205.6 million to $119.8 million from a loss of $85.8 million in 2016. The income was primarily due to foreign currency translation adjustments resulting primarily from exchange rate movements of the Euro, British pound and Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2017 as compared with 2016. Business Segments We conduct our operations through three business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment operating income (loss). See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our segments. The key operating results for our three business segments, EPD, IPD and FCD, are discussed below. Engineered Product Division Segment Results Our largest business segment is EPD, through which we design, manufacture, distribute and service custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals and auxiliary systems (collectively referred to as "original equipment"). EPD includes longer lead time, highly-engineered pump products and mechanical seals that are generally manufactured within shorter lead times. EPD also manufactures replacement parts and related equipment and provides aftermarket services. EPD primarily operates in the oil and gas, petrochemical, chemical, power generation, water management and other general industries. EPD operates in 47 countries with 28 manufacturing facilities worldwide, eight of which are located in Europe, nine in North America, six in Asia and five in Latin America, and it has 119 QRCs, including those co-located in manufacturing facilities.

The increase was driven by customer original equipment bookings. Of the $1.8 billion of bookings in 2017, approximately 51% were from oil and gas, 19% from chemical, 17% from general industries and 13% from power generation. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) increased $6.6 million. Sales in 2018 increase d $123.8 million , or 7.0% , as compared with 2017 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $12 million . The increase was more heavily-weighted towards aftermarket sales, resulting from increase d customer sales of $57.7 million into Asia Pacific, $51.9 million into Africa, $50.6 million into Latin America and $49.2 million into North America that were partially offset by decreased sales of $73.0 million into the Middle East and $11.4 million into the Europe.

Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) increased $4.5 million. Gross profit in 2018 increase d by $40.1 million , or 7.3% , as compared with 2017 . G ross profit margin in 2018 of 30.9% increase d from 30.7% in 2017 . The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of increased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and increased savings achieved related to our Realignment Programs, partially offset by increased charges related to our Realignment Programs and revenue recognized on lower margin projects. The impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard had a slightly favorable impact on gross profit margin. Gross profit in 2017 decreased by $78.1 million , or 12.5% , as compared with 2016. Gross profit margin in 2017 of 30.7% decreased from 31.3% in 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the negative impact of decreased sales on our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and lower margin projects that shipped from backlog, partially offset by lower costs and increased savings related to our Realignment Programs, a mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales and $10.9 million of charges to write down inventory in Brazil in 2016 that did not recur. SG&A in 2018 decrease d by $8.8 million , or 2.2% , as compared with 2017. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $2 million . The decrease in SG&A is primarily attributable to a $26.0 million impairment charge related to our manufacturing facility in Brazil in 2017 that did not recur, lower bad debt expense and decreased charges related to our Realignment Programs, partially offset by higher selling and administrative related expenses. SG&A in 2017 decrease d by $58.3 million , or 12.7% , as compared with 2016. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $2 million. The decrease in SG&A is primarily due to EPD's $71.2 million portion of the $73.5 million reserve established for our primary Venezuelan customer in the third quarter of 2016 that did not recur and increased savings related to our Realignment Programs, partially offset by a $26.0 million impairment charge in the second quarter of 2017 related to our manufacturing facility in Brazil. Operating income in 2018 increase d by $47.8 million , or 30.0% , as compared with 2017 . The increase included currency benefits of approximately $1 million .

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Analysis 2018 2017 2016 (Amounts in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 190.8 $ 311.1 $ 240.5 Net cash flows (used) provided by investing activities (81.5 ) 176.6 (91.5 ) Net cash flows used by financing activities (173.3 ) (185.4 ) (143.7 ) Existing cash, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2018 was $619.7 million , compared with $703.4 million at December 31, 2017 and $367.2 million at December 31, 2016 . Our cash provided by operating activities was $190.8 million , $311.1 million and $240.5 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, which provided cash to support short-term working capital needs. Cash flow used by working capital increased in 2018 due primarily to cash used by higher inventory of $29.3 million , higher accounts receivable of $25.4 million , higher contract assets of $23.7 million and lower accrued liabilities and income taxes payable of $18.2 million , partially offset by cash provided by higher contract liabilities of $33.7 million . Cash flow provided by working capital increased in 2017 due primarily to cash provided by lower accounts receivable of $60.2 million , lower inventory of $48.6 million and higher accounts payable of $12.4 million . During 2018 , we contributed $48.1 million to our defined benefit pension plans as compared to $44.9 million in 2017 . Increases in accounts receivable used $25.4 million of cash flow in 2018 , as compared with cash provided of $60.2 million in 2017 and $36.9 million in 2016 . The increase in cash used by accounts receivable in 2018 was partially attributable to higher sales during the period as compared to the same period in 2017 . For the fourth quarter of 2018 our days' sales outstanding ("DSO") was 72 days as compared to 75 days for 2017 and 74 days for 2016 . The adoption of the New Revenue Standard as of January 1, 2018 had an estimated favorable impact of 3 days on DSO as of December 31, 2018 . We have not experienced a significant increase in customer payment defaults in 2018 . 42 Increases in inventory used $29.3 million of cash flow in 2018 as compared with cash provided of $48.6 million and $52.9 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The use of cash from inventory in 2018 was primarily due to decreased progress billings and in 2017 the cash provided was due to decreased work in process and finished goods inventory. Inventory turns were 4.2 times at December 31, 2018 , as compared with 3.3 times for both 2017 and 2016 . The adoption of the New Revenue Standard as of January 1, 2018 had an estimated favorable impact of approximately 1.1 times on our inventory turn calculation as of December 31, 2018 . Our calculation of inventory turns does not reflect the impact of advanced cash received from our customers. Increases in contract assets used $23.7 million of cash flow and increases in contact liabilities provided $33.7 million of cash flow in 2018. Decreases in accounts payable used $4.8 million of cash flow in 2018 compared with cash provided of $12.4 million in 2017 and cash used of $71.0 million in 2016 . Decreases in accrued liabilities and income taxes payable used $18.2 million of cash flow in 2018 compared with $3.4 million in 2017 and $88.8 million in 2016 . Cash flows used by investing activities were $81.5 million in 2018 , as compared to cash provided of $176.6 million and cash used of $91.5 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decrease of cash provided in 2018 was primarily due to $232.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of our Gestra and Vogt businesses in 2017 that did not recur. Capital expenditures were $84.0 million , $61.6 million and $89.7 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In 2019, we currently estimate capital expenditures to be between $90 million and $100 million before consideration of any acquisition activity. Cash flows used by financing activities were $173.3 million in 2018 compared to $185.4 million and $143.7 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Cash outflows during 2018 resulted primarily from $99.4 million of dividend payments and $60.0 million in payments on long-term debt. Cash outflows during 2017 resulted primarily from $99.2 million of dividend payments and $60.0 million in payments on long-term debt. Cash outflows during 2016 resulted primarily from $97.7 million of dividend payments and $60.0 million in payments on long-term debt. We have maintained our previously-announced policy of annually returning 40% to 50% of running two-year average net earnings to shareholders following attainment of the previously announced target leverage ratio. We had no share repurchase activity in 2018, 2017 or 2016 and as of December 31, 2018 we had $160.7 million of remaining capacity under our share repurchase plan previously approved by the Board of Directors. While we intend to adhere to this policy for the foreseeable future, any future returns of cash through dividends and/or share repurchases, will be reviewed individually, declared by our Board of Directors and implemented by management at its discretion, depending on our financial condition, business opportunities and market conditions at such time. Our cash needs for the next 12 months are expected to be lower than those of 2018 due to our Realignment Programs being substantially completed and anticipated benefits from working capital reductions. We believe cash flows from operating activities, combined with availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and our existing cash balances, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by a decrease in the rate of general global economic growth and an extended decrease in capital spending of our customers, as well as economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for periods beyond the next 12 months. Dispositions We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise economical capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report contains a discussion of our disposition activity. Financing Our amended credit agreement provides for a $195.0 million term loan ( Term Loan Facility ) and a $800.0 million revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Senior Credit Facility ) with a maturity of October 14, 2020. The current Senior Credit Facility includes the following: (i) leverage ratio of 4.00 times debt to total Consolidated EBITDA through June 30, 2019, with a step-down to 3.75 for any fiscal quarter ending after July 43 1, 2019, (ii)a pricing level on our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings at or below Ba2/BB, with an interest rate margin for LIBOR loans of 2.00% and for base rate loans of 1.00% and (iii) maximum principal amount of priority debt up to 7.5% of the consolidated tangible assets and a maximum amount of receivables that can be securitized of $100 million. Subject to certain conditions, including lender approval, we have the right to increase the amount of the Term Loan Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $400.0 million. A discussion of our debt and related covenants is included in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2018 . Certain financing arrangements contain provisions that may result in an event of default if there was a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that could result in an acceleration of payment due. Such provisions are referred to as "cross default" provisions. The Senior Credit Facility and the Senior Notes as described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report are cross-defaulted to each other. The rating agencies assign credit ratings to certain of our debt. Our access to capital markets and costs of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. In particular, a decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility. Liquidity Analysis Our cash balance decreased by $83.8 million to $619.7 million as of December 31, 2018 as compared with December 31, 2017 . The cash decrease included $84.0 million in capital expenditures, $99.4 million in dividend payments and $60.0 million in payments on long-term debt, partially offset by $190.8 million in operating cash inflows. Approximately 57% of our currently outstanding Term Loan Facility and $13.5 million of other short-term borrowings are due to mature in 2019 and 2020 . Our Senior Credit Facility matures in October 2020. Our borrowing capacity is subject to financial covenant limitations based on the terms of our Senior Credit Facility and is also reduced by outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018 , we had an available capacity of $513.7 million , no borrowings outstanding and $92.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility is committed and held by a diversified group of financial institutions. For additional information on our Senior Credit Facility, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , as a result of the values of the plan assets and our contributions to the plan, our U.S. pension plan was fully-funded as defined by applicable law. After consideration of our intent to maintain fully funded status, we contributed $20.0 million to our U.S. pension plan in 2018 , excluding direct benefits paid of $3.3 million . We continue to maintain an asset allocation consistent with our strategy to maximize total return, while reducing portfolio risks through asset class diversification. OUTLOOK FOR 2019 Our future results of operations and other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross profit margin and costs, capital spending, expected cost savings from our transformation and realignment programs, global economic and political risk, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenses, potential impairment of assets, tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be affected by employee incentive compensation including our annual program and the amount, type and valuation of share-based awards granted, as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" as well as the section titled Forward-Looking Information is Subject to Risk and Uncertainty of this Annual Report. Our bookings were $4,019.8 million during 2018 . Because a booking represents a contract that can be, in certain circumstances, modified or canceled, and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition, there is no guarantee that bookings will result in comparable revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results. The outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies. In the short-term, we believe that stable oil prices will support oil and gas upstream and mid-stream investment and we further expect increased investment in later cycle downstream projects due to emerging market growth and certain regulatory requirements, such as IMO 2020. A recovery in the overall level of spending by oil and gas companies could continue to increase demand for our aftermarket products and services. We believe the medium and long-term 44 fundamentals for this industry remain attractive, and see a stabilized environment as the industry works through current excess supply. In addition, we believe projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth will require additional investments. With our long-standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream, mid-stream and downstream applications, along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to assist our customers in this improving environment. We expect a continued competitive economic environment in 2019 . We anticipate benefits from the continuation of our Flowserve 2.0 Transformation efforts, end-user strategies, the strength of our high margin aftermarket business, continued disciplined cost management, our diverse customer base, our broad product portfolio and our unified operating platform. Similar to prior years, we expect our results will be weighted towards the second half of the year. While we believe that our primary markets continue to provide opportunities, we remain cautious in our outlook for 2019 given the continuing uncertainty of capital spending in many of our markets as well as economic and political risk associated with our international operations which could have a negative effect on global economic conditions. On December 31, 2018 , we had $1,364.8 million of fixed-rate Senior Notes outstanding and $104.8 million of variable-rate debt under our Term Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2018 , we had no variable to fixed interest rate derivative contracts. Due to the fact that a portion of our debt carries a variable rate of interest, our debt is subject to volatility in rates, which could impact interest expense. We expect our interest expense in 2019 will be relatively consistent with amounts incurred in 2018 . Our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Annual Report. We expect to generate sufficient cash from operations and have sufficient capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt payments and pension plan contributions in 2019 . The amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues, customer cash advances, backlog, customer-driven delays and other factors. We will seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory. In 2019 , our cash flows for investing activities will be focused on strategic initiatives, information technology infrastructure, general upgrades and cost reduction opportunities and we currently estimate capital expenditures to be between $90 million and $100 million , before consideration of any acquisition activity. We have $60.0 million in scheduled principal repayments in 2019 under our Term Loan Facility, and we expect to comply with the covenants under our Senior Credit Facility in 2019 . See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our debt covenants. We currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plan will be approximately $20 million , excluding direct benefits paid, in 2019 in order to maintain fully-funded status as defined by applicable law. We currently anticipate that our contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $9 million in 2019 , excluding direct benefits paid. 45 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 : Payments Due By Period Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Beyond 5 Years Total (Amounts in millions) Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes: $ 60.0 $ 44.8 $ 1,364.8 $ $ 1,469.6 Fixed interest payments(1) 36.6 73.3 36.4 146.3 Variable interest payments(2) 3.5 0.9 4.4 Other debt and capital lease obligations 8.2 5.3 13.5 Operating leases 68.4 88.3 50.0 66.5 273.2 Purchase obligations:(3) Inventory 411.1 3.4 0.2 414.7 Non-inventory 39.2 0.1 0.3 39.6 Pension and postretirement benefits(4) 59.5 123.3 122.7 295.9 601.4 Total $ 686.5 $ 339.4 $ 1,574.2 $ 362.6 $ 2,962.7 _______________________________________ (1) Fixed interest payments represent interest payments on the Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility as defined in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. (2) Variable interest payments under our Term Loan Facility were estimated using a base rate of three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2018 . (3) Purchase obligations are presented at the face value of the purchase order, excluding the effects of early termination provisions. Actual payments could be less than amounts presented herein. (4) Retirement and postretirement benefits represent estimated benefit payments for our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical plans, as more fully described below and in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2018 , the gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $41.2 million . We do not expect a material payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months. We are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the uncertain tax positions. The following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at December 31, 2018 : Commitment Expiration By Period Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Beyond 5 Years Total (Amounts in millions) Letters of credit $ 315.5 $ 136.8 $ 13.2 $ 26.4 $ 491.9 Surety bonds 94.6 1.0 8.9 104.5 Total $ 410.1 $ 137.8 $ 22.1 $ 26.4 $ 596.4 We expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS Plan Descriptions We and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 65% of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately 53% of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the U.S. qualified plan as of December 31, 2018 . Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to all of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans. None of our common stock is directly held by these plans. 46 Our U.S. defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of equity and fixed income securities. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets include a significant concentration of United Kingdom ("U.K.") fixed income securities , as discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We monitor investment allocations and manage plan assets to maintain acceptable levels of risk. At December 31, 2018 , the estimated fair market value of U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans decreased to $658.0 million from $713.5 million at December 31, 2017 . Assets were allocated as follows: U.S. Plan Asset category 2018 2017 Cash and Cash Equivalents 1 % 1 % Global Equity 30 % 36 % Global Real Assets 13 % 12 % Equity securities 43 % 48 % Diversified Credit 13 % 12 % Liability-Driven Investment 43 % 39 % Fixed income 56 % 51 % Non-U.S. Plans Asset category 2018 2017 Cash and Cash Equivalents 7 % 3 % North American Companies 3 % 3 % Global Equity 2 % 3 % Equity securities 5 % 6 % U.K. Government Gilt Index 43 % 41 % U.K. Corporate Bond Index % 1 % Global Fixed Income Bond 2 % 2 % Liability-Driven Investment 9 % 9 % Fixed income 54 % 53 % Multi-asset 19 % 22 % Buy-in Contract 10 % 10 % Other 5 % 6 % Other Types 34 % 38 % The projected benefit obligation ("Benefit Obligation") for our defined benefit pension plans was $809.2 million and $875.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants compensation and years of credited service. The estimated prior service cost and the estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2019 is approximately $0.4 million and $6.4 million , respectively. We amortize any estimated net gains or losses over the remaining expected service period or over the remaining expected lifetime for plans with only inactive participants . We sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. These plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies. We fund the plans as benefits are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. The benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees. The Benefit Obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was $18.8 million and $23.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The estimated actuarial net gain for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2019 is $0.2 million . The estimated prior service cost that is expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into pension expense in 2019 is $0.1 million . We amortize any estimated net gain or loss over the remaining average life expectancy of approximately 11 years . 47 Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions We account for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. Our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We, in consultation with our actuaries, evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits, such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets for funded plans, mortality rates, retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases, and determine such assumptions as of December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. See discussion of our accounting for and assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the Our Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A. In 2018 , net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in operating income was $28.2 million compared with $35.2 million in 2017 and $37.5 million in 2016 . The following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2018 : U.S. Plan Non-U.S. Plans Weighted average assumptions used to determine Benefit Obligation: Discount rate 4.34 % 2.42 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.50 3.28 Weighted average assumptions used to determine 2018 net pension expense: Long-term rate of return on assets 6.00 % 3.62 % Discount rate 3.63 2.25 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.01 3.25 The following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the U.S. qualified and aggregate non-U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement plans. Effect of Discount Rate Changes and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.4 ) $ 1.4 Effect on Benefit Obligation (16.2 ) 17.5 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (1.0 ) 0.9 Effect on Benefit Obligation (26.7 ) 30.2 U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense (0.1 ) 0.1 Effect on Benefit Obligation (0.5 ) 0.6 Effect of Changes in the Expected Return on Assets and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (2.1 ) $ 2.1 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (1.2 ) 1.2 As discussed below, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees or over the remaining expected lifetime for plans with only inactive participants . 48 At December 31, 2018 , as compared with December 31, 2017 , we increased our discount rate for the U.S. plan from 3.63% to 4.34% based on an analysis of publicly-traded investment grade U.S. corporate bonds, which had higher yields due to current market conditions. The average discount rate for the non-U.S. plans increased from 2.25% to 2.42% based on analysis of bonds and other publicly-traded instruments, by country, which had higher yields due to market conditions . The average assumed rate of compensation decreased from 4.01% to 3.50% for the U.S. plan and increased to 3.28% from 3.25% for our non-U.S. plans. To determine the 2018 pension expense, the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets remained constant at 6.00% and we decreased our average rate of return on non-U.S. plan assets from 3.88% to 3.62% , primarily based on our target allocations and expected long-term asset returns. As the expected rate of return on plan assets is long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rate. For all U.S. plans, we adopted the RP-2006 mortality tables and the MP-2018 improvement scale published in October 2018. We applied the RP-2006 tables based on the constituency of our plan population for union and non-union participants. We adjusted the improvement scale to utilize 75% of the ultimate improvement rate, consistent with assumptions adopted by the Social Security Administration trustees, based on long-term historical experience. Currently, we believe this approach provides the best estimate of our future obligation. Most plan participants elect to receive plan benefits as a lump sum at the end of service, rather than an annuity. As such, the updated mortality tables had an immaterial effect on our pension obligation. We expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately $0.6 million higher in 2019 than the $28.2 million in 2018 , primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of actuarial gains and losses and no anticipated special events. We have used discount rates of 4.34% , 2.42% and 4.20% at December 31, 2018 , in calculating our estimated 2019 net pension expense for U.S. pension plans, non-U.S. pension plans and postretirement medical plans, respectively. The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were 7.0% for 2018 , 7.0% for 2017 and 7.5% for 2016 , with a gradual decrease to 5.0% for 2029 and future years. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care. Plan Funding Our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs. We contributed $48.1 million , $44.9 million and $46.8 million to our defined benefit plans in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. After consideration of our intent to remain fully-funded based on standards set by law, we currently anticipate that our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2019 will be approximately $20 million , excluding direct benefits paid. We expect to contribute approximately $9 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2019 , excluding direct benefits paid. For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. The most significant estimates made by management include: timing and amount of revenue recognition; deferred taxes, tax valuation allowances and tax reserves; reserves for contingent loss; pension and postretirement benefits; and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The significant estimates are reviewed at least annually if not quarterly by management. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may differ from the estimates, and the difference may be material. Our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting estimates and policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 49 Revenue Recognition Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" and all related ASUs ("New Revenue Standard"), using the modified retrospective method for transition. For a discussion related to our adoption of the New Revenue Standard requirements refer to Note 1 included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We recognize revenue either over time or at a point in time, depending on the specific facts and circumstances for each contract, including the terms and conditions of the contract as agreed with the customer and the nature of the products or services to be provided. Our primary method for recognizing revenue over time is the percentage of completion ( POC ) method, whereby progress towards completion is measured by applying an input measure based on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. If control of the products and/or services does not transfer over time, then control transfers at a point in time. We determine the point in time that control transfers to a customer based on the evaluation of specific indicators, such as title transfer, risk of loss transfer, customer acceptance and physical possession. For a discussion related to revenue recognition refer to Note 2 included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves We recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances, if necessary. We assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could, if successful, result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. While we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. Reserves for Contingent Loss Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is reasonably estimable. Assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts, including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations. The recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter, changes in political environments, legal venue and other factors. Recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties, technological innovation and regulatory environment changes. Estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos-related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed, settled and dismissed, with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur. A substantial majority of our asbestos-related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities. Estimated indemnities and receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos-related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries, which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers. We have claims pending against certain insurers that, if resolved more favorably than estimated future recoveries, would result in discrete gains in the applicable quarter. We are currently unable to estimate the impact, if any, of unasserted asbestos-related claims, although future claims would also be subject to existing indemnities and insurance coverage. Changes in claims filed, settled and 50 dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, including former employees, and their beneficiaries. The assets, liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates, turnover, rates of compensation increases and other factors. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These assumptions are assessed annually in consultation with independent actuaries and investment advisors as of December 31 and adjustments are made as needed. We evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained, including appropriate rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation (health care cost trend) rates. We ensure that our significant assumptions are within the reasonable range relative to market data. The methodology to set our significant assumptions includes: Discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments. For the U.S. the discount rate is obtained from an analysis of publicly-traded investment-grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate. For plans in the U.K. and the Eurozone we use the discount rate obtained from an analysis of AA-graded corporate bonds used to generate a yield curve. For other countries or regions without a corporate AA bond market, government bond rates are used. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term high-quality debt securities, as well as the duration of our plans liabilities. The expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies, expected long-term performance of asset classes, risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. These rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates. The expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels, seniority, age and other factors. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. We evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations, cash flow requirements and other factors. We discuss our funding assumptions with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets The initial recording of goodwill and intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. We test the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. The test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units. The identification of our reporting units began at the operating segment level and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purpose of testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions. These conditions included, among other factors, (i) the extent to which a component represents a business and (ii) the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments and resulted in four reporting units. Other factors that were considered in determining whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the methods of distribution and the types of industries served. An impairment loss for goodwill is recognized if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, 51 business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. We did not record an impairment of goodwill in 2018, 2017 or 2016; however, the estimated fair value of our EPO and IPD reporting units reduced significantly in 2016 and 2015 due to broad-based capital spending declines and heightened pricing pressure experienced in the oil and gas markets which are anticipated to continue in the near to mid-term. The EPO reporting unit is a component of our EPD reporting segment and is primarily focused on long lead time, custom and other highly-engineered pump products and systems. As of December 31, 2018, our EPO reporting unit had approximately $158 million of goodwill and its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 60% as compared to approximately $159 million of goodwill and its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 82% as of December 31, 2017. In addition, our IPD reporting unit had approximately $311 million of goodwill and its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 40% as of December 31, 2018 as compared to approximately $319 million of goodwill and its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 66% as of December 31, 2017. Key assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of our EPO and IPD reporting units included the annual operating plan and forecasted operating results, successful execution of our current Flowserve Transformation 2.0 program and identified strategic initiatives, a constant cost of capital, continued stabilization and mid to long-term improvement of the macro-economic conditions of the oil and gas market, and a relatively stable global gross domestic product. Although we have concluded that there is no impairment on the goodwill associated with our EPO and IPD reporting units as of December 31, 2018, we will continue to closely monitor their performance and related market conditions for future indicators of potential impairment and reassess accordingly. We considered our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill. Our market capitalization decreased slightly as compared with 2017 and did not indicate a potential impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2018. Impairment losses for indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a "relief from royalty" method, which estimates the fair value of a trademark by determining the present value of estimated royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that have a significant impact on the fair value and are substantially consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above. We did not record a material impairment of our trademarks in 2018 , 2017 or 2016 . The recoverable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, is reviewed when indicators of potential impairments are present. The recoverable value is based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing assumptions similar to those for goodwill. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
