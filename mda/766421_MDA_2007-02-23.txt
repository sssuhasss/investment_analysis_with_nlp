ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Our Business a brief general description of our airlines and the airline industry. Year in Review highlights from 2006 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of the results of operations of Alaska and Horizon for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. We believe this analysis will help the reader better understand our consolidated statements of operations. This section also includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2007. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations, commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements, an overview of financial position and the impact of inflation and changing prices. OUR BUSINESS Alaska and Horizon operate as airlines in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry. However, their business plans, competition, and economic risks differ substantially. Alaska is a major airline and principally serves destinations in the state of Alaska and provides north/south service between cities in the western U.S., Canada and Mexico. Alaska also provides east/west service to eight cities, primarily from Seattle. It operates an all-jet fleet, and its average passenger trip in 2006 was 1,038 miles. Horizon is a regional airline serving primarily the Pacific Northwest, northern California, and western Canada. It operates both jet and turboprop aircraft, and its average passenger trip in 2006 was 392 miles. Both airlines outstanding employees and excellent service are regularly recognized by independent studies, awards, and surveys of air travelers. Our goal is to use our people, our award-winning customer service, and our strong financial position to become more competitive and gain market share in our primary markets, specifically in and from the Pacific Northwest. In doing so, we strive to grow in such a way that creates value for our three most important stakeholders employees, customers and shareholders. YEAR IN REVIEW Although we reported a net loss in 2006, this year was a very successful year for the Company in many respects. We saw strong 12% revenue growth in 2006, benefiting from industry-wide fare increases, growth in passenger traffic and record load factors for the full year. Operating expenses were up significantly from 2005, primarily due to the following: another year of record high fuel prices; $189.5 million of fleet transition costs related to our MD-80 fleet; a $50.2 million increase in wages and benefits, including incentive pay; and restructuring-related severance charges of $24.8 million in 2006, compared to similar charges of $20.4 million in the prior year. 33 Table of Contents Excluding fuel, the fleet transition costs, the restructuring charges, and a 2005 navigation fee refund, operating costs were $2,333.9 million in 2006, an increase of $89.7 million over 2005. This increase was well outpaced by the improvement in revenue for the year. Unit cost per available seat mile at Alaska excluding fuel, fleet transition costs, restructuring charges and the navigation fee refund in 2005 declined from 8.01 cents per ASM in 2005 to 7.81 cents in 2006. Horizon unit costs excluding fuel, however, increased by 6.3% primarily due to a 70.7% increase in maintenance costs as many of the Q400 aircraft began to come off the warranty period. We believe looking at unit costs per available seat mile, excluding fuel and other noted items, is useful because it helps us assess structural costs and our competitiveness and is a measure commonly used by management at other airlines and by industry watchers. Accomplishments Accomplishments from 2006 include: Total revenues exceeded the $3 billion mark for the first time in our history. For the first time ever, annual sales through our websites alaskaair.com and horizonair.com exceeded $1 billion. In 2006, we processed almost 40% of our total sales through our websites. Air Group employees earned $36.8 million in variable incentive pay in 2006, which is the largest payout in our history. Excluding the fleet transition costs, restructuring charges, and a 2005 navigation fee refund, and stating fuel on an economic basis as described below, Alaska and Horizon reported 2006 income before taxes of $200.5 million and $23.2 million, respectively, both significant improvements over equivalent measures in 2005. Reconciliations between our GAAP results and these amounts are presented on pages 30 through 32. Because of our strong cash position, we contributed $121.9 million into our defined-benefit pension plans, bringing the funded status up to nearly 80% on a projected benefit obligation basis. Alaska had its 737-400 full-freighter aircraft delivered in 2006. We expect to have four 737-400 combination passenger and cargo aircraft delivered in 2007, two of which were delivered in January. Fleet Transition During the first quarter of this year, we announced our plan to retire our entire MD-80 fleet by the end of 2008 as part of Alaska move to an all-Boeing 737 fleet. We believe this transition, when completed, will provide more than $130 million in annual operating savings by way of lower fuel, maintenance, and training costs. As a result of this decision, we recognized an impairment charge of $131.1 million ($82.0 million after tax) during the first quarter related to 15 owned MD-80 aircraft. At that time, we also estimated that we would have significant additional charges resulting from any actions taken on our 11 leased MD-80 aircraft. During the third quarter, we realized a portion of that expected charge as we purchased five of the leased MD-80s from the lessors for cash of $69.3 million and assumed debt of $11.6 million. Immediately upon purchase of the aircraft, we evaluated the aircraft for impairment and concluded that the carrying value was not recoverable. Therefore, we recorded a $58.4 million charge ($36.5 million after tax) in the third quarter, including the impairment and the write-off of $1.8 million of leasehold improvements related to those aircraft. The charge was offset by the reduction of $7.5 million of deferred rent associated with the acquired aircraft. We are in the process of receiving and reviewing bids from and negotiating with potential buyers for all or a portion of our 20 owned MD-80s, although we are uncertain as to the sales price or timing of any future sale. As of December 31, 2006, we had six leased MD-80s. One of those aircraft was decommissioned in December 2006 and one in January 2007, and both were returned to the lessor in January 2007. We expect to cease operation of the remaining four leased aircraft prior to their lease expiration dates, which will likely result 34 Table of Contents in a charge in our consolidated statements of operations. We anticipate that once the aircraft have been removed from operation, we will dispose of the aircraft through lease buy-outs, lease agreement restructuring, subleasing of the aircraft, or storing the aircraft at a long-term storage facility. In 2006, we entered into a purchase-and-sale agreement to sell six B737-200 aircraft to a third party. Our seventh (and remaining) B737-200 aircraft will be donated to an aviation museum in Alaska. The six aircraft will be sold and delivered at various intervals through April 2007. Two of the six aircraft were transferred to the buyer during the year and there were nominal gains on the sales. During the third quarter, Horizon signed a letter of intent with another carrier to sublease up to 16 of its Bombardier Q200 aircraft. Each aircraft will be subject to a separate sublease agreement and will leave Horizon operating fleet beginning in January 2007 through mid-2008. It is expected that the sublease will result in a loss for Horizon approximating the difference between the lease payments and the sublease receipts. The loss on each aircraft will be recorded when the specific aircraft leave Horizon fleet and the sublease arrangement begins. The first of the Q200s were transferred to the sublessee in January 2007, resulting in a sublease loss and other related exit costs of approximately $2 million. We expect the charge to be approximately $1.5 million to $2 million on each of the 16 aircraft. Labor Costs and Negotiations We reached new four-year agreements with Alaska flight attendants, clerical, office and passenger service personnel, and ramp service agents and store clerks in 2006, as further described below: During the second quarter, Alaska reached an agreement with the Association of Flight Attendants on a new four-year contract for the airline approximately 2,500 flight attendants. The new agreement included an immediate 3% pay increase and an aggregate signing bonus of $2.7 million. Additionally, Alaska offered a voluntary severance package to a number of flight attendants that includes, among other things, a lump-sum payment of $2,000 per year of service up to a maximum of 25 years and continuing travel benefits. The total charge in 2006 related to the severance package was $3.8 million ($2.4 million after tax) and is included in restructuring charges and adjustments in the consolidated statements of operations. During the third quarter, we reached new four-year agreements with the approximately 3,700 clerical, office and passenger service employees and ramp service agents and stock clerks at Alaska, all represented by the International Association of Machinists. These agreements included a signing bonus, in aggregate, of $1.9 million in July 2006 and an immediate 2% wage increase. Additionally, the agreements included a severance package offered to employees in the top four wage-scale steps that includes cash payments based on years of service, one year of medical coverage after the severance date, and continued travel privileges for a period of time. The total charge in 2006 related to the severance package was $21.0 million ($13.1 million after tax) and is included in restructuring charges and adjustments in the consolidated statements of operations. We are pleased with the long-term contracts that have been reached with the majority of our labor groups. We are now in the process of negotiating new contracts with pilots at both Alaska and Horizon. The contract with Alaska pilots becomes amendable May 1, 2007 and the contract with Horizon pilots became amendable September 12, 2006. We do not know what the final outcome of these negotiations will be. However, at the present time, none of the contract negotiations is at an impasse or has reached the 30-day cooling off period required under the Railway Labor Act that would trigger self-help. Therefore, we currently believe the risk of a work stoppage is low. 35 Table of Contents In relation to the two severance packages noted above and prior restructuring efforts, the following table displays the activity and balance of the severance and related cost accruals as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 ($ in millions): Accrual for Severance and Related Costs Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 3.1 Restructuring charges and adjustments 24.8 Cash payments (8.0 ) Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 19.9 Mark-to-Market Fuel Hedging Gains and Losses We currently do not use hedge accounting for our fuel-hedging portfolio. As a result, our earnings are more volatile as we mark our entire hedge portfolio to market value each period through earnings, even though the actual consumption and related cash settlement will take place in a future period. Historically, we reported these gains and losses in other nonoperating income and expense. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, however, we report these gains and losses in aircraft fuel expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year format. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Because of the sharp rise in jet fuel prices in 2005, the value of our fuel hedge contracts increased significantly, resulting in a large mark-to-market gain and a resulting reduction in our fuel expense as reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In 2006, fuel prices remained high for most of the year, resulting in nominal market-based changes to the value of our portfolio. However, the aggregate value of our hedge portfolio declined significantly as many of our in-the-money hedges settled during the period. Our portfolio of fuel hedge contracts was worth $68.6 million at December 31, 2006, including the value of capitalized premiums paid to counterparties, compared to $153.3 million at December 31, 2005. The vast majority of the contracts in our portfolio are call options, which effectively cap the crude oil price component of our fuel consumption. While they limit our exposure when oil prices increase, these types of contracts also allow us to benefit from a reduction in oil prices. Management uses three measures of fuel expense as more fully described below: Raw fuel expense defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers. Economic fuel expense defined as raw fuel expense minus the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we recognize. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. In 2006 and 2005, Air Group recorded gains from settled fuel hedges totaling $101.1 million and $125.0 million, respectively. Based on current oil prices and because our hedge positions have higher strike prices than those that existed in 2006, we expect that gains from settled hedges will be significantly lower in the future than they have been for the last two years. We believe that we have been, and will continue to be among the best-hedged airlines in the industry, and this measure helps us compare our costs to those of our competitors. GAAP fuel expense defined as raw fuel expense plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments that we include in our income statement as the value of our fuel-hedging portfolio increases and decreases. By 36 Table of Contents definition, our GAAP fuel expense is very volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these mark-to-market adjustments. A key difference between GAAP fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition. When we refer to economic fuel expense , we only include gains when they are realized through a cash receipt from our hedge contract counterparties. Under GAAP fuel expense , those gains are recognized when the underlying instrument increases in value, which in the past has occurred in an earlier reporting period. We have provided information about our economic fuel expense and per-gallon costs on pages 31 and 32. For more discussion, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. We continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices. We began entering into hedge contracts again in the third quarter of 2006 after several quarters of no activity. We expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively, although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions. Frontier JetExpress In the third quarter of 2006, we announced that Horizon would discontinue its contract flying with Frontier Airlines as Frontier JetExpress. We have nine CRJ-700 aircraft dedicated to this program, all of which will return to Horizon operating fleet in 2007. Two of these were returned in January and the remaining seven are scheduled to come back in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. We expect to use these aircraft for productive and strategic redeployments throughout Horizon network and for harmonization flying with Alaska. Other Events Subsequent to year-end, Horizon was named 2007 Regional Airline of the Year by Air Transport World. The publication cited, among other positive items, an exemplary safety record, superior commitment to customer service, and positive financial results during challenging industry times. Outlook For 2007, Alaska and Horizon expect capacity increases of between 4.0% and 4.5% and approximately 10.5%, respectively, as measured by available seat miles. This is compared to an expected domestic capacity increase of 2% 3% industry-wide. The expected capacity increase at Alaska is due primarily to the introduction of 14 new B737-800 aircraft in 2007 and the annualization of capacity additions that resulted from 12 B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2006, offset by the early retirement of several MD-80 aircraft and scheduled retirement of other aircraft. On a net basis, we expect that Alaska fleet size will increase by only two aircraft, although the 737-800 aircraft are larger than the MD-80s, allowing for the capacity growth mentioned above. Horizon expected capacity increase is due largely to the 13 new Q400 aircraft that will be delivered in 2007 and an increase in the number of seats in the existing fleet of Q400s from 74 seats to 76 seats, offset by the subleasing of 11 Q200 aircraft to another carrier. The aircraft deliveries in 2007 at both Alaska and Horizon will be used to replace outgoing aircraft, increase frequency in our existing markets and, to a lesser degree, serve new markets. For much of 2005 and 2006, our operational performance (particularly at Alaska) has fallen short of our goals and our customers expectations. We currently have several initiatives underway to help improve our on-time performance, completion rates, baggage handling, and other important customer-driven operational measures. Delivering on these core operational promises is one of our highest-priority internal goals for 2007. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2006 Compared With 2005 Our consolidated net loss for 2006 was $52.6 million, or $1.39 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.9 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in 2005. 37 Table of Contents Both the 2006 and 2005 results include certain significant items that affect the comparability of the years: Our 2006 consolidated net loss includes charges of $189.5 million ($118.5 million after tax) associated with our fleet transition plan (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements); We recorded restructuring charges of $24.8 million ($15.5 million after tax) in 2006 associated with the severance packages offered to eligible employees affected by new contracts this year compared to $20.4 million ($12.7 million, net of tax) in 2005 related to severance costs resulting from the subcontracting of the ramp services operation in Seattle and costs associated with the termination of the lease at our Oakland heavy maintenance base; Adjustments to state our fuel on an economic basis totaling $89.9 million ($56.3 million after tax) of losses and $61.7 million ($38.6 million after tax) of gains in 2006 and 2005, respectively; Our 2005 consolidated net loss includes a $144.7 million pre-tax ($90.4 million after tax) charge resulting from the change in the method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements; and Our 2005 results also include a $5.7 million ($3.6 million after tax) refund, including $1.0 million of related interest income, for navigation fees paid in Mexico. Excluding these items, and with fuel stated on an economic basis as explained above, our consolidated net income would have been $137.7 million for 2006 compared to $55.0 million in 2005. We believe presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors and other readers because: we believe it is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves our ability to compare our results to other carriers; this financial measure is the basis for our various incentive plans, thus allowing investors to better understand the changes in variable incentive pay expense in our consolidated statements of operations; this financial measure is frequently used in internal management and Board reporting and decision making; and we believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts. Financial and statistical data comparisons for Alaska and Horizon are shown on pages 28 and 29, respectively. On pages 30 through 32, we have included a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Alaska Airlines Revenues Operating revenues increased $276.4 million, or 11.4%, during 2006 due primarily to a 6.7% increase in operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) and a 4.4% increase in capacity. The increase in RASM was driven almost entirely by a 6.7% increase in ticket yields resulting largely from higher ticket prices. The increase in capacity is primarily the result of having a fleet of 114 operating aircraft at December 31, 2006 compared to 110 at December 31, 2005 and a longer average stage length this year compared to last year. Although we do not provide specific revenue forecasts, year-over-year RASM was up 1.3% in January 2007 compared to January 2006. However, our January 2007 passenger RASM was down 0.8% from the same time in 2006 primarily because of a 2.5 point decline in load factor, offset by a 2.8% increase in ticket yields. As the industry adds domestic capacity in 2007, we may experience some downward pressure on yields, but it is not known to what extent. Load factor increased slightly by 0.7 percentage points to 76.6% during 2006 due primarily to a 5.4% increase in passenger traffic outpacing the 4.4% increase in capacity. We experienced a slight decline in year-over-year load factor in the fourth quarter of 2006. We believe the decline is primarily due to the severe weather in the Pacific Northwest during the months of November and December, but the full financial effect of those storms is difficult to determine. The load factor in January 2007 was down 2.5 points from January 2006 to 66.5%. We currently expect first quarter 2007 load factor will be down compared to the first quarter of 2006. 38 Table of Contents Freight and mail revenues increased $3.1 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2005 primarily resulting from higher mail and freight yields and fuel surcharges that we added to our freight services beginning in the third quarter of 2005, offset by lower freight volumes. Revenues from our cargo operations were lower than expected for 2006 due to the delay in the delivery of our modified 737-400 cargo aircraft. Our full- freighter aircraft was delivered in 2006, although later than originally planned, and the four combination passenger/cargo aircraft have been delayed in production. Three of the four were originally scheduled for delivery in 2006, but none were actually delivered during the year. Two were delivered in January and the remaining two are expected in the second quarter of 2007. These delays constrained the cargo operations from increasing capacity and thereby the volume of cargo shipped. As we add more capacity in 2007, we expect freight and mail revenues to increase slightly compared to 2006. Other-net revenues increased only slightly by $3.2 million, or 2.2%. Mileage Plan revenues were slightly lower than in 2006, primarily as a result of lower commissions recognized for sold miles. As yields increased in 2006, the rate at which we defer the revenue related to sold miles increased, resulting in a smaller percentage of those cash receipts recorded as commission revenue during the period. The decline in commission revenue associated with sold miles was partially offset by higher net revenues from award redemption on our partner airlines. Alaska Airlines Expenses Total operating expenses increased $512.4 million, or 22.5%, as compared to 2005. This increase is largely due to fleet transition costs in 2006, a significant increase in aircraft fuel (including hedging gains and losses), and increases in wages and benefits, variable incentive pay, contracted services, selling expenses, depreciation and amortization, and restructuring charges, offset by a decline in aircraft maintenance and aircraft rent. Operating expenses per ASM increased 17.3% to 11.98 cents in 2006 from 10.21 cents in 2005. Operating expense per ASM excluding fuel, fleet transition costs, restructuring charges and a navigation fee refund in 2005 decreased 2.5% as compared to 2005. Our current estimates for operating costs per ASM, excluding fuel, for mainline flying for the first quarter and full year of 2007 are between 8.0 cents and 8.1 cents and between 7.5 cents and 7.6 cents, respectively. Achieving our cost targets is dependent on both actual spending and ASM production. In the past two years, we have made temporary reductions to our schedule to help improve our operational results. When that occurs, it is difficult to remove all of the associated costs from our system and, as a result, our unit costs increase disproportionately. If we reduce our ASM plan again in 2007, then our unit costs likely would increase. Operating costs per ASM ( CASM ) is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost-reduction efforts. Our effort to reduce unit cost focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend, but also on increasing our capacity without adding a commensurate amount of cost. As was the case in 2006, our goal for the next two years is to grow capacity primarily through larger-gauge aircraft with the introduction of the new, larger 737-800s and the retirement of the MD-80 aircraft. The total number of operating aircraft in our fleet will not change significantly through 2008. Along with our financial and statistical data on page 28, we are presenting here our line-item expenses on a per-ASM basis (in cents). We believe this information is useful to investors because it highlights areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity: Years Ended December 31, CASM Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Wages and benefits 3.19 3.24 3.57 (0.05 ) (0.33 ) Variable incentive pay 0.12 0.07 0.02 0.05 0.05 Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 3.25 2.14 1.78 1.11 0.36 Aircraft maintenance 0.67 0.83 0.65 (0.16 ) 0.18 Aircraft rent 0.48 0.52 0.51 (0.04 ) 0.01 Landing fees and other rentals 0.68 0.70 0.61 (0.02 ) 0.09 39 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, CASM Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Contracted services 0.57 0.54 0.43 0.03 0.11 Selling expenses 0.61 0.59 0.62 0.02 (0.03 ) Depreciation and amortization 0.59 0.56 0.58 0.03 (0.02 ) Food and beverage service 0.21 0.22 0.22 (0.01 ) Other 0.69 0.71 0.67 (0.02 ) 0.04 Fleet transition costs 0.81 0.81 Restructuring charges and adjustments 0.11 0.09 0.24 0.02 (0.15 ) Impairment of aircraft and related spare parts 0.17 (0.17 ) Total Operating Expenses per ASM 11.98 10.21 10.07 1.77 0.14 Explanations of significant year-over-year changes in the components of operating expenses in dollar terms are as follows: Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased by $21.2 million, or 2.9%, during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the following: the $2.7 million signing bonus and an increase in wages resulting from the new four-year contract with our flight attendants that was ratified during the second quarter of 2006; the $1.9 million signing bonus and an increase in wages resulting from the new four-year contract with our clerical, office and passenger service employees and our ramp service and stores agents that was ratified during the third quarter of 2006; market-based pay adjustments for our non-union personnel in the spring of 2006 and an increase in stock-based compensation expense following the adoption of SFAS 123R; an increase in mechanics wages resulting from the contract ratified in the fourth quarter of 2005; and increased postretirement medical and pension costs. The increase from prior year was partially offset by the following: the reduction in pilot wages resulting from the pilot contract that took effect in May 2005; and the subcontracting of our ramp services operation in Seattle in the second quarter of 2005. We currently expect wages and benefits to increase slightly in 2007, but decline on a per-ASM basis. This expectation is exclusive of any potential change in pilot wages that may result from our current contract negotiations. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay increased $12.4 million, or 81.0%, over 2005, primarily due to a significant improvement in 2006 Air Group profit, as determined in the incentive agreements. For purposes of our incentive pay plans, profit is generally defined as results excluding fleet transition costs, restructuring charges , and other amounts specified in the various incentive plan documents and with fuel stated on an economic basis . Air Group maintains several incentive plans that collectively cover all of our employees and create alignment for employees, customers and shareholders. These plans include both operational and financial performance metrics that, to a large extent, are based on certain annual financial targets. 40 Table of Contents Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel increased $281.0 million, or 59.0%, primarily due to the significant mark-to-market gains recorded in 2005 that followed the sharp increases in world oil prices. Our raw fuel expense increased $127.7 million to $765.6 million, driven by a 2.3% increase in gallons consumed and a 17.4% increase in raw fuel cost per gallon. We realized gains of $87.0 million from settled hedge contracts, compared to $108.8 million in 2005, resulting in economic fuel expense of $678.6 million, a 28.3% increase over 2005. Our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 25.5% from $1.53 in 2005 to $1.92 in 2006. We currently expect our economic fuel cost per gallon in 2007 to be slightly lower than in 2006 based on prevailing prices, although this can change rapidly and materially. In addition to our fuel-hedging program, we have entered into fuel contracts whereby the spread between crude oil prices and jet fuel prices was fixed for approximately 50% of our expected consumption in the first quarter of 2007. The savings from these contracts was not material during 2006. See page 31 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by Alaska (the economic cost per gallon) and the cost per gallon on a GAAP basis (including all hedging gains and losses). Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance decreased by $28.4 million, or 15.3%, mostly as a result of fewer high-dollar engine maintenance events, a decline in the number and change in the mix of airframe events, lower per-event costs due to renegotiated contracts with our outside vendors, and savings from process improvement initiatives. We expect that maintenance expense will decline in 2007 in both dollars and on a per-unit basis. This is primarily due to the continuing retirement of the MD-80 aircraft, the full retirement of our B737-200C aircraft, and the introduction of new B737-800s that will require relatively very little maintenance in the near-term. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent decreased by $5.9 million, or 5.1%, primarily as a result of the buyout of five MD-80 aircraft from leases during the third quarter of 2006, offset by two new B737-800 operating leases entered into in the fourth quarter of 2006. We expect aircraft rent to decline modestly in 2007 as two additional leased MD-80s are returned to the lessor. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased slightly by $2.0 million, or 1.3%, as a result of slightly higher airport and security costs, specifically at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) where a retroactive increase to the beginning of 2006 was imposed on certain carriers late in the year. The increase for Alaska was approximately $1.5 million. We expect that the rate hike will increase our costs at LAX by approximately $7 million per year. We, along with other affected carriers, are disputing the rate increase at LAX (see further discussion under Legal Proceedings on page 21). Our costs at Sea-Tac are also expected to increase in 2007. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $11.9 million, or 9.9%, primarily resulting from the subcontracting of the Company Seattle ramp operations in May 2005. Additionally, a $4.7 million navigation fee refund was received in 2005, which reduced our 2005 expenses. We expect contracted services in 2007 to increase slightly. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased $8.9 million, or 6.7%, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue-related expenses such as credit card and codeshare commissions resulting from the rise in revenues over the prior period and an increase in incentive payments to Horizon for certain flying. We expect selling expenses to decline in 2007 in dollar terms and in terms of unit costs as a result of new agreements we have in place with credit card and GDS vendors. 41 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $12.4 million, or 9.9%, compared to 2005. This increase is primarily due to the delivery of two new owned B737-800 aircraft in 2005 and ten new owned B737-800 aircraft in 2006, the purchase of five MD-80 aircraft from lessors during the third quarter of 2006, and the acceleration of depreciation on our owned MD-80 fleet to reduce the carrying value to estimated realizable value as they come out of the fleet, offset by the lower depreciable base on the MD-80 fleet following the impairment charge taken in the first quarter of 2006. We expect a similar increase in 2007 as we take delivery of 14 new B737-800 aircraft during the year. Other Information Alaska and Horizon entered into an agreement effective January 1, 2007, whereby Alaska will purchase from Horizon capacity in certain routes ( incentive markets ) specified by the agreement. This agreement will result in a new presentation in Alaska statement of operations. The revenue from the incentive markets will be identified as Passenger revenue regional affiliates and the associated costs will be identified as Regional flying costs. Alaska also has a similar arrangement in place with a third-party carrier for flying between Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Historically, the revenue from this arrangement has been presented in Other revenue net and the associated costs have been in Contracted services. In 2007, all of these revenues and costs will be presented with the incentive-market flying and the prior periods will be reclassified to conform. Horizon Air Revenues Operating revenues increased $87.6 million, or 15.7%, in 2006 compared to 2005. This increase reflects an 8.4% increase in per unit revenues (RASM) and a 6.8% increase in capacity. The capacity increase is primarily due to the addition of one CRJ-700 in January 2006, two Q400s that began operating in June and August 2006, increased capacity from adding four more seats to our Q400s in the third quarter of 2005, and increased flying for Frontier. Revenue and capacity from the Frontier contract flying represented approximately 8% of passenger revenues and 23% of capacity in 2006, similar to the prior year. As mentioned previously, Horizon will begin transitioning out of the Frontier contract flying in the first quarter of 2007. The RASM increase from the prior-year period resulted from a 9.1% RASM increase in our native network flying, offset by a 1.4% decline in RASM from the Frontier contract flying. The Frontier decline is a function of a 5.7% increase in capacity coupled with a fee arrangement based on certain measures that do not correspond to capacity. As such, the per-unit revenues become diluted as more capacity is added. Passenger load factor increased 1.3 percentage points to 74.1% as a result of continued increase in demand. Passenger yield increased 7.0% to 23.53 cents, largely benefiting from industry-wide fare increases. Horizon Air Expenses Operating expenses for 2006 increased $104.9 million, or 19.9%, compared to 2005. Operating expenses per ASM increased 12.2% as compared to 2005. Operating expenses per ASM excluding fuel increased 6.3% to 14.19 cents, compared to 13.35 cents in 2005. Our current estimates for costs per ASM, excluding fuel for the first quarter and full year of 2007 are 15.7 cents and 14.2 cents, respectively. The increase in costs per ASM is due to the significant costs associated with the sublease loss and related maintenance costs that will be recorded as we sublease Q200s to another carrier throughout the year. 42 Table of Contents Along with our financial and statistical data on page 29, we are presenting here our line item expenses on a per-ASM basis (in cents): Years Ended December 31, CASM Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Wages and benefits 5.21 5.11 5.23 0.10 (0.12 ) Variable incentive pay 0.25 0.14 0.03 0.11 0.11 Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 3.21 2.15 1.88 1.06 0.27 Aircraft maintenance 2.03 1.27 1.23 0.76 0.04 Aircraft rent 1.91 2.07 2.38 (0.16 ) (0.31 ) Landing fees and other rentals 1.29 1.40 1.33 (0.11 ) 0.07 Contracted services 0.74 0.70 0.67 0.04 0.03 Selling expenses 0.87 0.86 0.85 0.01 0.01 Depreciation and amortization 0.51 0.49 0.43 0.02 0.06 Food and beverage service 0.08 0.07 0.07 0.01 Other 1.30 1.24 1.35 0.06 (0.11 ) Impairment of aircraft and related spare parts 0.12 (0.12 ) Total Operating Expenses per ASM 17.40 15.50 15.57 1.90 (0.07 ) Explanations of significant year-over-year changes in the components of operating expenses in dollar terms are as follows: Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased $15.6 million, or 9.0%, over 2005 reflecting a 4.5% increase in the average number of full-time equivalent employees and an increase in wages per employee. We expect wages and benefits to increase slightly in 2007, but decline on a per-unit basis in 2007 as we work toward higher productivity and efficiencies. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay increased $4.4 million, or 93.6%, over 2005, as a result of the same reasons noted above in the Alaska discussion. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel increased $43.6 million, or 59.8%, over 2005 primarily as a result of the significant mark-to-market gains recorded in 2005 that followed the sharp increases in world oil prices. Our raw fuel expense increased $21.4 million to $119.1 million, driven by a 5.8% increase in gallons consumed and a 15.3% increase in raw fuel cost per gallon. We realized gains of $14.1 million from settled hedge contracts, compared to $16.2 million in 2005, resulting in economic fuel expense of $105.0 million, a 28.8% increase over 2005. Our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 22.2% from $1.58 in 2005 to $1.93 in 2006. Like Alaska, we currently expect Horizon economic fuel cost per gallon in 2007 to be slightly lower based on prevailing prices, although this can change rapidly and materially. We also expect our fuel consumption on a per-ASM to improve in 2007 as we replace some of our older Q200s with new Q400 aircraft, which are more fuel efficient. See page 32 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by Horizon (the economic cost per gallon) and the cost per gallon on a GAAP basis (including all hedging gains and losses). 43 Table of Contents Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance expense increased $30.6 million, or 70.7%, primarily as a result of more scheduled heavy checks and engine overhauls for the Q200 and Q400 fleets with fewer aircraft covered under warranty. We expect maintenance expense to increase again in 2007 as we anticipate a higher rate of planned maintenance activity. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent declined slightly by $0.9 million, or 1.3%, in 2006 primarily resulting from the annualization of lower rates on extended leases and fewer leased engines. We expect that aircraft rent will increase significantly in 2007 as we begin to recognize the sublease loss on up to 16 Q200s, of which 11 are expected to leave our fleet in 2007. We anticipate a charge, on average, of $1.5 million per aircraft. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by $4.7 million, or 11.1%, largely a result of higher crew expenses and passenger remuneration costs. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense ) Net nonoperating expense was $0.5 million in 2006 compared to $29.3 million in 2005. Interest income increased $23.4 million compared to 2005, primarily as a result of higher average portfolio returns and a higher average cash and marketable securities balance. Interest expense increased $15.0 million primarily resulting from interest rate increases on our variable-rate debt, new debt arrangements in 2006, and the changes to some of our variable-rate debt arrangements to slightly higher fixed rates. This increase was offset by the conversion of our $150 million senior convertible notes to equity in April 2006, which eliminated further interest expense on those notes. Capitalized interest increased $15.8 million from $8.9 million in 2005 to $24.7 million during 2006. This is due to the significant increase in pre-delivery deposits in connection with our orders for B737-800 and Bombardier Q400 aircraft. We expect that nonoperating expense will increase in 2007 as we continue to finance new aircraft deliveries resulting in a higher average debt balance, while at the same time maintaining a stable cash and marketable securities portfolio. Consolidated Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Our consolidated effective income tax rate on pre-tax income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for 2006 was 40.1% compared to an effective income tax rate of 38.4% in 2005. The 2006 year also includes $5.5 million of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax benefit rate for 2006 would have been 33.8%, which is different from our marginal 2006 tax rate of 37.4%. The difference is primarily due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards. We applied our 2005 marginal rate of 37.5% to the cumulative effect of the accounting change. Our remaining tax contingency accruals are not significant. 2005 Compared With 2004 Our consolidated net loss for 2005 was $5.9 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, versus a consolidated net loss of $15.3 million, or $0.57 per share, in 2004. Our consolidated income before income tax and the accounting change for 2005 was $137.2 million compared to a pre-tax loss in 2004 of $20.6 million. The 2005 results include certain items that impact the comparability of the years. These items are discussed in the Results of Operations: 2006 Compared With 2005 44 Table of Contents section beginning on page 37. Our 2004 results also include certain items that impact comparability, including severance charges of $53.4 million, an impairment charge of $40.2 million related primarily to our Boeing 737-200C fleet, mark-to-market adjustments on our hedge portfolio, and a navigation fee refund of $11.0 million. Excluding those items, the year-over-year improvement can be characterized by higher revenues, offset by slightly higher non-fuel operating costs and significantly higher fuel costs. Financial and statistical data comparisons for Alaska and Horizon are shown on pages 28 and 29, respectively. On pages 30 through 32, we have included a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Alaska Airlines Revenues Operating revenues increased $183.1 million, or 8.2%, during 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of an 8.2% increase in operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) on relatively flat capacity. The increase in RASM was driven by a 3.5% increase in ticket yields that resulted from an increase in ticket prices designed to offset higher fuel prices, higher load factors, and higher freight, mail and other revenues. The flat capacity is primarily a direct result of the reduction in our summer flight schedule that was announced in June 2005, offset by the addition of three B737-800 aircraft during the year. Load factor increased 3.0 percentage points to a record 75.9% for 2005, primarily as a result of an increase in passenger traffic. Freight and mail revenues increased by $3.9 million, or 4.5%, compared to 2004 as a result of a mail contract we have in the state of Alaska that began in the third quarter of 2004 and fuel surcharges added to our freight services during the third quarter of 2005, offset by lower freight volumes. Other-net revenues increased $19.8 million, or 16.1%, largely a result of an increase in Mileage Plan revenues, derived from higher award redemption on our partner airlines and an increase in commission revenue associated with sold mileage credits and an increase in our revenues from service to Dutch Harbor, which is operated by a third party. Alaska Airlines Expenses In 2005, total operating expenses increased $33.2 million, or 1.5%, compared to 2004. Operating expenses per ASM increased 1.4% from 10.07 cents in 2004 to 10.21 cents in 2005. The increase in operating expenses is due largely to the significant increase in raw fuel expense and increases in aircraft maintenance, contracted services, landing fees and other rentals, and other, offset by larger gains on our fuel hedge portfolio, declines in wages and benefits, food and beverage service, selling expenses, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, and the impairment charge in 2004 related to our Boeing 737-200C fleet. Operating expenses per ASM excluding fuel, the navigation fee refund, restructuring and impairment charges increased 1.1% compared to 2004. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits decreased $73.2 million, or 9.2%, during 2005 compared to 2004. Wages were favorably impacted by the following: restructuring initiatives announced in late 2004; the reduction in pilot wages resulting from the new pilot contract that took effect in May 2005; the subcontracting of our ramp services operation in Seattle beginning in the second quarter of 2005; the reduction of 903 full-time equivalents (FTEs) during 2005 to 9,065; and a reduction in benefits cost due to the reduction in FTEs and pension expense. 45 Table of Contents The year-over-year decline in wages and benefits was partially offset by a favorable $6.6 million adjustment in 2004 related to the ultimate loss estimates for workers compensation. Overall, the reduction in wages and benefits costs were partially offset by increases in contracted services and maintenance expense as a result of the subcontracting of certain operations. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay increased $10.9 million due to Air Group improved financial performance, as defined in the incentive plans Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel increased $79.3 million, or 20.0%, primarily as a result of the sharp increases in world oil prices. Our raw fuel expense increased $151.3 million to $637.9 million, driven by a 34.3% increase in raw fuel cost per gallon, offset by a 2.3% decline in fuel gallons consumed. We realized gains of $108.8 million from settled hedge contracts, compared to $39.8 million in 2004, resulting in economic fuel expense of $529.1 million, a 18.4% increase over 2004. Our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 21.4% from $1.26 in 2004 to $1.53 in 2005. In the second quarter of 2005, we entered into a fuel contract whereby the spread between crude oil prices and jet fuel prices is fixed for approximately one-third of our fuel consumption through April 2006. This contract resulted in approximately $10 million in savings for Alaska during 2005. See page 31 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by Alaska (the economic cost per gallon) and the cost per gallon on a GAAP basis (including all hedging gains and losses). Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance increased $39.4 million, or 27.0%, largely resulting from the performance of more airframe work and engine overhauls in 2005 than were performed in 2004. Other factors causing the increase were our power-by-the-hour maintenance agreement whereby we expense B737-400 engine maintenance on a flight-hour basis, regardless of whether the work was actually performed during the period; the contracting out of related heavy maintenance to third parties, which resulted in a shift of costs from wages and benefits into aircraft maintenance; the change in our accounting policy regarding engine and airframe overhauls (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements); as well as certain enhancements to aircraft interiors, systems and flight decks to assist with reliability improvement. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $19.9 million, or 14.6%. The increase reflects higher landing fee rates and increased rental costs, primarily in Seattle, Portland and Los Angeles, offset by fewer departures. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $23.4 million, or 24.2%, largely resulting from the subcontracting of our fleet service and ground support equipment and facility maintenance functions in the fourth quarter of 2004, and the Seattle ramp operations in May 2005. Additionally, the navigation fee refund recorded in contracted services was $4.7 million in 2005 compared to $7.7 million in 2004. Other Expenses Other expenses increased $9.0 million, or 6.1%, primarily reflecting increases in passenger remuneration, crew costs, supplies, and legal settlement costs, partly offset by lower insurance premiums. Additionally, in 2004 there were $2.0 million in losses on disposal of assets compared to $3.0 million in 2005. 46 Table of Contents Horizon Air Revenues In 2005, operating revenues increased $53.2 million, or 10.6% compared to 2004. This increase is due largely to the increased capacity in both the Horizon-brand flying and contract flying for Frontier Airlines, which began in January 2004, combined with the slight increase in operating revenues per available seat mile (RASM). The increase in RASM was due primarily to an increase in load factors, partially offset by a 2.8% decline in ticket yields. Load factor increased 3.5 percentage points to 72.8% for 2005, primarily as a result of the 14.8% increase in passenger traffic outpacing the 9.4% increase in capacity. The increases in passenger traffic and capacity are due primarily to increased contract flying with Frontier, the harmonization flying with Alaska, the addition of one CRJ-700 in 2005 and four additional seats on each of our Q400s. Contract flying with Frontier represented approximately 9% of passenger revenues and 23% of capacity, during 2005 compared to 9% and 21%, respectively, in 2004. Horizon Air Expenses Operating expenses for 2005 increased $43.2 million, or 8.9%, compared to 2004. Operating expenses per ASM decreased 0.5% compared to 2004. Operating expenses per ASM excluding fuel and impairment charges decreased 1.7% compared to 2004. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased $11.1 million, or 6.8%, reflecting a slight increase in the average number of employees and wages per employee and the move to a new paid-time-off program resulting in a one-time charge related to the transition. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay increased $3.8 million reflecting the improved financial performance and a new operationally-based incentive program for all employees. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel costs increased $14.4 million, or 24.6%, primarily resulting from the sharp increases in world oil prices. Our raw fuel expense increased $27.0 million to $97.7 million, driven by a 3.2% increase in gallons consumed and a 33.8% increase in raw fuel cost per gallon. We realized gains of $16.2 million from settled hedge contracts, compared to $5.4 million in 2004, resulting in economic fuel expense of $81.5 million, a 24.8% increase over 2004. Our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 20.6% from $1.31 in 2004 to $1.58 in 2005. See page 32 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by Horizon (the economic cost per gallon) and the cost per gallon on a GAAP basis (including all hedging gains and losses). Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance expense increased $5.0 million, or 13.1%, primarily due to a higher number of engine overhauls and propeller work for the Q400 fleet and to fewer aircraft being covered by warranty. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $6.3 million, or 15.2%. Higher landing fees are a result of significant rate increases at several of our key airports, and to increased departures and new markets served. 47 Table of Contents Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) Net nonoperating expense was $29.3 million in 2005 compared to $26.3 million in 2004. Interest income increased $6.4 million as a result of improved returns and a slightly larger average marketable securities portfolio in 2005, offset by the interest income in 2004 associated with the navigation fee refund. Interest expense increased $11.1 million due to interest rate increases on our variable-rate debt and the changes to some of our variable-rate debt agreements to slightly higher fixed-rate agreements. Capitalized interest increased $7.2 million in 2005. This increase is due to the significant increase in deposits for future flight equipment resulting from orders for Boeing 737-800 and Bombardier Q400 aircraft. Consolidated Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Our consolidated effective income tax rate on pre-tax income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for 2005 was 38.4% compared to an effective income tax rate of 25.7% on a pre-tax loss in 2004. Due to the magnitude of nondeductible expense, such as employee per-diem costs, relative to a marginal pre-tax profit or loss, a relatively small change in pre-tax results may cause a significant change in the effective tax rate. We applied our 2005 marginal rate of 37.5% to the cumulative effect of the accounting change. Change in Accounting Policy Effective January 1, 2005, we changed our method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls from the capitalize and amortize method to the direct expense method. Under the former method, these costs were capitalized and amortized to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life of the overhaul or the remaining lease term. Under the direct expense method, overhaul costs are expensed as incurred. We believe that the direct expense method is preferable because it eliminates the judgment and estimation needed to determine overhaul versus repair allocations in maintenance activities. Additionally, our approved maintenance program for the majority of our airframes now focuses more on shorter, but more frequent, maintenance visits. We also believe that the direct expense method is the predominant method used in the airline industry. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2005, we wrote off the net book value of our previously capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all aircraft resulting in a charge of $144.7 million pre-tax ($90.4 million after tax). We do not believe disclosing the effect of adopting the direct expense method on net income for 2005 provides meaningful information because of changes in our maintenance program, including the execution of a power-by-the-hour engine maintenance agreement with a third party in late 2004. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties, and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. Mileage Plan Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on Alaska or Horizon and our many travel partners. Additionally, we sell miles to third parties, such as our credit card partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on Alaska, Horizon, or any of our alliance partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For awards earned by passengers who fly on Alaska, Horizon or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation. For miles sold to third parties, the majority of the sales 48 Table of Contents proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided. The commission component of these sales proceeds (defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer) is recorded as other-net revenue when the cash is received. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on Alaska or Horizon, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately 103 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $545.6 million. Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in estimates; therefore, an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles: We defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel. As fare levels change, our deferral rate changes, which may result in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given quarter. For example, due to the year-over-year increases in average industry ticket prices, our deferral rate increased in 2006, resulting in lower commission revenue and an increase in the amount of revenue deferred for miles sold. Holding all other assumptions constant, an additional 1% increase in the deferral rate would have reduced our 2006 commission revenue by approximately $2.1 million. 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): Members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket, and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel. Therefore, based on the number of Mileage Plan accounts and the miles in the accounts, we estimate how many miles will never be used ( breakage ), and do not record a liability for those miles. Our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members accounts, account balances, and other factors. We believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable in light of historical experience and future expectations. A hypothetical 1.0% change in our estimate of breakage (currently 12% in the aggregate) has approximately a $6.0 million effect on the liability. Actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates. 3. The number of miles used per award (i.e., free ticket): We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. If actual miles used are more or less than estimated, we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical redemptions on Alaska, Horizon or other airlines. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on Alaska or Horizon versus other airlines: The cost for Alaska or Horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on Alaska or Horizon versus on other airlines and accrue the costs based on our estimate of historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel: When a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on Alaska or Horizon, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be 49 Table of Contents (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We review Mileage Plan estimates each quarter, and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. Pension Plans We account for the defined-benefit pension plans using SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income. Under SFAS No. 158, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $78.3 million, $71.7 million, and $78.3 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our qualified defined-benefit pension plan assets totaled $835.9 million. We contributed $121.9 million to the plan in 2006 and anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately $50 million during 2007. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 7.75%. This rate was developed with input from consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as considered appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2006 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by 0.5% (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would increase our estimated 2007 pension expense by approximately $4.2 million. Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced. We discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 5.75% and 5.50% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high-quality long-term bonds. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 5.75% to 5.25%) would increase our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2006 by approximately $74.9 million and increase estimated 2007 pension expense by approximately $9.0 million. With the exception of the plan covering Alaska pilots, all of our defined-benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. Long-lived Assets As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $2.4 billion of property and equipment and related assets. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, 50 Table of Contents changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. In March 2006, our Board approved a plan to accelerate the retirement of our MD-80 fleet (15 owned and 11 leased aircraft at the time) and remove those aircraft from service by the end of 2008, which is earlier than the original retirement schedule. As a result of this decision, we evaluated impairment as required by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and concluded that the carrying value of the MD-80 fleet was no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2006, the Company recorded an impairment charge totaling $131.1 million to write down the fleet to its estimated fair market value. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2006, we bought five MD-80 aircraft from lessors and terminated the leases for those five aircraft. The total purchase price for the five aircraft was $80.9 million, including assumed debt of $11.6 million. Immediately upon purchase of the aircraft, we evaluated impairment and concluded that the carrying value was not recoverable. As a result, we recorded an additional $58.4 million charge in the third quarter for the impairment. See Note 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about the impairment of the MD-80s and a similar impairment to our Boeing 737-200 aircraft recorded in 2004. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and their salvage values at the time of an impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft. Workers Compensation and Employee Health-Care Accruals We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for workers compensation claims and employee health-care benefits. Liabilities associated with these risks are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Our workers compensation and employee health care accruals totaled $35.7 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $34.4 million at December 31, 2005. Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets The Company has a net deferred tax asset of $19.6 million at December 31, 2006, which includes gross deferred tax assets of $504.2 million, partially offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $484.6 million. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Based on the available evidence, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would be realizable and thus no valuation allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2006. Our conclusion is based on the expected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and does not rely on future taxable income. Should we incur additional losses in the future, our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to greater uncertainty. New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108). SAB 108 expresses SEC staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether those misstatements are material to our financial statements. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted SAB 108 effective January 1, 2006. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 51 Table of Contents In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions, as defined in that statement. The purpose of FIN 48 is to clarify certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income tax uncertainties. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not believe this interpretation will have a material impact on our results from operations or financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair-value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157, but do not expect the statement to have a significant impact on our results from operations or financial position. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-03, How Sales Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation) . The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure. EITF 06-03 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 31, 2006. Taxes collected from our passengers, which include sales taxes, airport and security fees and other fees, are and have been recorded on a net basis. We have no intention of modifying this accounting policy. As such, the adoption of EITF 06-03 will not have an effect on our results from operations or financial position. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Change (In millions, except per-share and debt-to-capital amounts) Cash and marketable securities $ 1,013.9 $ 982.6 $ 31.3 Working capital 335.6 374.7 (39.1 ) Long-term debt, net of current portion 1,031.7 969.1 62.6 Shareholders equity 885.5 827.6 57.9 Book value per common share $ 21.97 $ 24.74 ($ 2.77 ) Long-term debt-to-capital 54%: 46 % 54%:46 % NA Long-term debt-to-capital assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent 72%: 28 % 73%:27 % NA Our debt-to-capital ratio, including aircraft operating leases, decreased from December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of the conversion to equity of our senior convertible notes in April 2006, partially offset by a $52.6 million net loss for 2006, unfavorable adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income for pension and postretirement obligations totaling $61.4 million after tax, an $18.6 million after-tax adjustment to equity upon our adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, and an increase in our outstanding debt in connection with new aircraft-secured debt arrangements in 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our cash and marketable securities increased $31.3 million to $1,013.9 million. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase and our expectation of future cash requirements. 52 Table of Contents Analysis of Cash Flows Cash Provided by Operating Activities During 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $449.8 million, compared to $270.1 million during 2005. The improvement was driven by significantly higher operating revenues and a decline in cash payments made for severance compared to the prior year, offset by continued increases in fuel costs and $121.9 million in cash contributions to our defined-benefit pension plans during 2006 compared to $69.3 million during the same period in 2005. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, but anticipate consuming substantially all of that cash for capital expenditures and debt payments in the next several years. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $533.0 million during 2006, compared to $481.1 million in 2005. We had net sales of $129.4 million of marketable securities and spent $678.5 million for property and equipment additions, net of proceeds from asset dispositions, resulting in an increase of $268.1 million compared to 2005. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the increase in pre-delivery payments made for future aircraft deliveries and the purchase in 2006 of ten B737-800s, five MD-80s out of leases, two Q400s and one CRJ-700, compared to three B737-800s in 2005. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $680 million (of which $605 million is expected to be aircraft-related) in 2007 as we take delivery of 14 new B737-800 and 13 new Bombardier Q400 aircraft. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $240.3 million during 2006 compared to $256.6 million during 2005. We obtained debt financing for nine new B737-800 aircraft and one CRJ-700 purchased in 2006. We had $30.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock through stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan, compared to $15.2 million during 2005. Offsetting these increases were normal long-term debt payments of $62.0 million and debt payments on our pre-delivery payment facility of $140.6 million in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we issued 5.7 million shares of common stock for proceeds of $200.0 million, net of underwriting discounts and professional fees. We plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand, additional debt financing, and availability of credit under our pre-delivery payment facility. We have debt financing arranged for 10 of our 14 firm 2007 deliveries of B737-800s and are currently negotiating financing for the Q400s. Supplemental Disclosure of Noncash Investing and Financing Activities In the second quarter of 2006, we called for redemption all of our $150 million senior convertible notes, and all of the notes were converted by the holders into shares of our common stock. Additionally, we assumed debt totaling $11.6 million in connection with the purchase of one of the MD-80 aircraft purchased from lessors during the third quarter of 2006. Bank Line-of-Credit Facility Alaska has a $160 million variable-rate credit facility that expires in March 2008. As of December 31, 2006, there are no outstanding borrowings on this credit facility and the Company has no immediate plans to borrow using this credit facility. See Note 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Pre-delivery Payment Facility Alaska $172 million variable-rate revolving loan facility is available to provide a portion of the pre-delivery funding requirements of Alaska purchase of new Boeing 737-800 aircraft under the current aircraft purchase agreement. The facility expires on August 31, 2009. The interest rate is based on one-month LIBOR 53 Table of Contents plus a specified margin. Any borrowings will be secured by Alaska rights under the Boeing purchase agreement. The principal amounts outstanding on the facility relate to specified aircraft and will be repaid at the time that Alaska takes delivery of the aircraft, if not sooner, likely using proceeds from long-term debt financing on those aircraft. As of December 31, 2006, $39.2 million was outstanding. No amounts have been borrowed subsequent to year-end, although we may use the facility in the future to fund additional pre-delivery payments. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Aircraft Purchase Commitments At December 31, 2006, we had firm orders for 51 aircraft requiring aggregate payments of approximately $1.2 billion, as set forth below. Alaska has options to acquire 24 additional B737s and purchase rights for 27 more, and Horizon has options to acquire 19 Q400s and 15 CRJ-700s. Alaska and Horizon expect to finance the firm orders and, to the extent exercised, the option aircraft with leases, long-term debt or internally generated cash. During 2006, Alaska took delivery of 12 B737-800s, two of which are under operating lease agreements, one was paid for with cash on hand, and nine were paid for with cash and then subsequently financed with fixed-rate debt arrangements. Horizon took delivery of two used Q400s, both of which were paid for with cash on hand, and one CRJ-700, which was financed with a variable-rate debt arrangement. During 2006, Alaska executed an arrangement to sell six B737-200 aircraft. Title to each aircraft will be transferred as each of the aircraft leaves our fleet over the next several months, with the last aircraft expected to leave our fleet in April 2007. Two of these aircraft were sold during 2006 and two were sold subsequent to the end of the year, all of which resulted in nominal gains on the transactions. The following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year, as of December 31, 2006: Delivery Period - Firm Orders Aircraft 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Beyond 2011 Total Boeing 737-800 14 11 4 6 3 38 Bombardier Q400 13 13 Total 27 11 4 6 3 51 Payments (Millions) $ 536.6 $ 270.3 $ 159.9 $ 146.0 $ 44.9 $ 1,157.7 Two of the B737-800 aircraft and four of the Q400s were delivered subsequent to December 31, 2006. The two B737-800 were paid for with cash on hand and subsequently debt-financed. The Q400s were paid for with cash on hand. Management is currently reviewing financing alternatives for the Q400s, but no agreements have been executed as of the date of this report. The remaining B737-800 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2007 are generally evenly spread throughout the rest of the year. The majority of the 13 Q400s will be delivered in the first six months of the year. Financing for seven of the remaining 11 B737-800 aircraft deliveries in 2007 has already been arranged. The other four deliveries are expected to be paid for with cash on hand. The Company is evaluating financing options for the Q400 deliveries. If we are able to successfully achieve targeted profitability and implement our growth strategy, Alaska and Horizon will continue to convert additional options and purchase rights into firm orders, resulting in capital expenditure spending .. Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other 54 Table of Contents obligations as of December 31, 2006. This table excludes contributions to our various pension plans, which we expect to be approximately $50 million to $80 million per year through 2010. Beyond (in millions) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2011 Total Current and long-term debt obligations (excluding the pre- delivery payment facility) $ 79.9 $ 83.7 $ 88.1 $ 94.2 $ 122.4 $ 643.3 $ 1,111.6 Current and long-term portions of the pre-delivery payment facility 39.2 39.2 Operating lease commitments(1) 246.8 237.3 218.2 207.7 177.4 680.6 1,768.0 Aircraft purchase commitments 536.6 270.3 159.9 146.0 44.9 1,157.7 Interest obligations (2) 75.1 70.5 63.0 56.8 50.2 143.2 458.8 Other purchase obligations (3) 29.4 29.7 30.0 30.3 30.6 93.6 243.6 Total $ 1,007.0 $ 691.5 $ 559.2 $ 535.0 $ 425.5 $ 1,560.7 $ 4,778.9 (1) Operating lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. The aircraft operating leases include lease obligations for six leased MD-80 aircraft, four of which we intend to retire earlier than expected in connection with our fleet transition plan. (2) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2006. (3) Includes minimum obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreement. Effect of Inflation and Price Changes Inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income.
