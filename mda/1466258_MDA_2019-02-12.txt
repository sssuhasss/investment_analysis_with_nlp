Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Organization We are a diversified, global company that provides products, services and solutions to enhance the quality, energy efficiency and comfort of air in homes and buildings, transport and protect food and perishables and increase industrial productivity and efficiency. Our business segments consist of Climate and Industrial, both with strong brands and highly differentiated products within their respective markets. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include well-recognized, premium brand names such as Ingersoll-Rand , Trane , Thermo King , American Standard , ARO , and Club Car . To achieve our mission of being a world leader in creating comfortable, sustainable and efficient environments, we continue to focus on growth by increasing our recurring revenue stream from parts, service, controls, used equipment and rentals; and to continuously improve the efficiencies and capabilities of the products and services of our businesses. We also continue to focus on operational excellence strategies as a central theme to improving our earnings and cash flows. Trends and Economic Events We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, and the breadth of our product and services portfolios, have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the Company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. We regularly perform detailed evaluations of the different market segments we are serving to proactively detect trends and to adapt our strategies accordingly. In addition, we believe our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Current economic conditions are showing positive trends in each of the segments in which we participate. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment replacement, services, controls and aftermarket continue to experience strong demand. In addition, Residential and Commercial markets have seen continued momentum in the United States, positively impacting the results of our HVAC businesses. Global Industrial markets remain largely supportive of continued growth in both equipment and services. While geopolitical uncertainty exists in markets such as Europe, Asia and Latin America, we are confident we will continue our strong performance globally. In 2019, we expect positive growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments, each benefiting from operational excellence initiatives, new product launches and continued productivity programs. We believe we have a solid foundation of global brands that are highly differentiated in all of our major product lines. Our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service, parts and replacement revenue streams. In addition, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth. Significant Events Acquisitions and Equity Investments We continue to be active with strategic acquisitions and investments. During 2018, acquisitions and equity method investments, net of cash acquired totaled $285.2 million. Related amounts in 2017 and 2016 were $157.6 million and $9.2 million, respectively. In May 2018, we completed our investment of a 50% ownership interest in a joint venture with Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (Mitsubishi). The joint venture, reported within the Climate segment, focuses on marketing, selling and supporting variable refrigerant flow (VRF) and ductless heating and air conditioning systems through Trane, American Standard and Mitsubishi channels in the U.S. and select Latin American countries. 20 Table of Contents In January 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of ICS Group Holdings Limited (ICS Cool Energy). The acquired business, reported within the Climate segment, specializes in the temporary rental of energy efficient chillers for commercial and industrial buildings across Europe. It also sells, permanently installs and services high performance temperature control systems for all types of industrial processes. During 2017, we acquired several businesses, including channel acquisitions, that complement existing products and services. Acquisitions within the Climate segment primarily consisted of independent dealers which support the ongoing strategy to expand our distribution network in North America. Other acquisitions within the segment strengthen our product portfolio. Acquisitions within the Industrial segment primarily consisted of a telematics business which builds upon our growing portfolio of connected assets. In addition, other acquisitions within the segment expand sales and service channels across the globe. On February 6, 2019, we entered into a final, binding and irrevocable offer letter with Silver II GP Holdings S.C.A., an affiliate of BC Partners Advisors L.P. and The Carlyle Group (the Seller) pursuant to which we made a binding offer to acquire the precision flow systems management business (the Business) for approximately $1.45 billion in cash, subject to working capital and certain other adjustments (the Acquisition). The Business is a manufacturer of precision flow control equipment including electric diaphragm pumps and controls that serve the global water, oil and gas, agriculture, industrial and specialty market segments. The offer is subject to completion of information and consultation processes with employee representative bodies of the Business in applicable jurisdictions. If the offer is accepted, completion of the Acquisition would be subject to customary closing conditions and expected to close mid-year 2019 subject to regulatory approvals. The results of the Business will be included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition and reported within the Industrial segment. Share Repurchase Program and Dividends Share repurchases are made from time to time in accordance with management's capital allocation strategy, subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements. In February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program (the 2017 Authorization) upon completion of the prior authorized share repurchase program. Repurchases under the 2017 Authorization began in May 2017 and ended in December 2018, completing the program. In October 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares upon completion of the 2017 Authorization. However, no material amounts were repurchased under this program during 2018. In June 2018, we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from $0.45 to $0.53 per ordinary share. This reflects an 18% increase that began with our September 2018 payment and an 83% increase since the beginning of 2016. Issuance and Redemption of Senior Notes In February 2018, we issued $1.15 billion principal amount of senior notes in three tranches through an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary. The tranches consist of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% senior notes due 2021, $550 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior notes due 2028 and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.300% senior notes due 2048. In March 2018, we used the proceeds to fund the redemption of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2018 and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due 2019, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes. Tax Cuts and Job Act In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) which made widespread changes to the Internal Revenue Code. The Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously not subject to U.S. tax and creates new income taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Act and allowed for adjustments to provisional amounts during a measurement period of up to one year. In accordance with SAB 118, we made reasonable estimates related to (1) the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax balances for the reduction in the tax rate (2) the liability for the transition tax and (3) the taxes accrued relating to the change in permanent reinvestment assertion for unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we recognized a net provisional income tax benefit of $21.0 million associated with these items in the fourth quarter of 2017. We completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the Act during 2018 and recorded $9.0 million of net measurement period adjustments as a component of Provision for income taxes during the year to increase the net provisional income tax benefit recorded as of December 31, 2017. Sale of Hussmann Equity Investment During 2011, we completed the sale of a controlling interest of our Hussmann refrigerated display case business (Hussmann) to a newly-formed affiliate of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). Per the terms of the agreement, CD&R ownership interest in Hussmann at the acquisition date was 60% with the remaining 40% being retained by us. As a result, we accounted for our interest in Hussmann using the equity method of accounting. 21 Table of Contents On December 21, 2015, we announced we would sell our remaining equity interest in Hussmann as part of a transaction in which Panasonic Corporation would acquire 100 percent of Hussmann's outstanding shares. The transaction was completed on April 1, 2016. We received net proceeds of $422.5 million for our interest and recognized a gain of $397.8 million on the sale. Results of Operations Our Climate segment delivers energy-efficient products and innovative energy services. It includes Trane and American Standard Heating & Air Conditioning which provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and commercial and residential building services, parts, support and controls; energy services and building automation through Trane Building Advantage and Nexia; and Thermo King transport temperature control solutions. Our Industrial segment delivers products and services that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It includes compressed air and gas systems and services, power tools, material handling systems, ARO fluid management equipment, as well as Club Car golf, utility and consumer low-speed vehicles. Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews, compensation and resource allocation. For these reasons, we believe that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. We define Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of Net revenues . On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (ASC 606), which created a comprehensive, five-step model for revenue recognition that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to increase Retained earnings by $2.4 million . Related amounts did not materially impact Net revenues , Operating income or the Balance Sheet. On January 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" (ASU 2016-09) which simplified several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. The standard made several modifications to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. In addition, ASU 2016-09 clarified the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. We applied the cash flow presentation requirements retrospectively. On January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, "Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost" (ASU 2017-07) which required a company to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line as other employee compensation costs with the remaining components of net periodic benefit cost presented separately from the service cost component and outside of any subtotal of operating income. We applied the presentation requirements retrospectively.

The components of the period change are as follows: Volume/product mix 7.3 % Acquisitions 1.1 % Pricing 1.6 % Currency translation 0.4 % Total 10.4 % The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Improved pricing, along with incremental revenues from acquisitions, further contributed to the year-over-year increase. In addition, each segment benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Our Revenues by segment are as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2018 2017 % change Climate $ 12,343.8 $ 11,167.5 10.5% Industrial 3,324.4 3,030.1 9.7% Total $ 15,668.2 $ 14,197.6 Climate Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by 10.5% or $ 1,176.3 million , compared with the same period of 2017 .

The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes and favorable product mix (0.9%) as well as pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (0.1%). These amounts were partially offset by investments and restructuring spending (0.5%). 23 Table of Contents Our Operating income and Operating margin by segment are as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2018 Operating Income (Expense) 2017 Operating Income (Expense) Period Change 2018 Operating Margin 2017 Operating Margin Climate $ 1,766.2 $ 1,572.7 $ 193.5 14.3 % 14.1 % Industrial 405.3 357.6 47.7 12.2 % 11.8 % Unallocated corporate expense (254.1 ) (265.0 ) 10.9 N/A N/A Total $ 1,917.4 $ 1,665.3 $ 252.1 12.2 % 11.7 % Climate Operating margin increased to 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with 14.1% for the same period of 2017 . The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes and favorable product mix. Other inflation in excess of productivity benefits, investments and restructuring spending partially offset the benefits. Industrial Operating margin increased to 12.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 11.8% for the same period of 2017 . The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes and favorable product mix, productivity benefits in excess of other inflation and pricing improvements in excess of material inflation. These amounts were partially offset by investments and restructuring spending. Unallocated Corporate Expense Unallocated corporate expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by 4.1% or $ 10.9 million , compared with the same period of 2017 . Lower functional costs from productivity projects more than offset compensation and benefit charges related to variable compensation. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $ 4.9 million compared with the same period of 2017 . During 2018, we issued $1.15 billion of senior notes and redeemed $1.1 billion of senior notes. The increase primarily relates to the redemption of the senior notes in which we recognized $15.4 million of premium expense and $1.2 million of unamortized costs in Interest expense . This amount was partially offset by lower interest rates on the new senior notes issued during the period. Other income/(expense), net The components of Other income/(expense), net , for the years ended December 31 are as follows: In millions 2018 2017 Period Change Interest income $ 6.4 $ 9.4 $ (3.0 ) Exchange gain (loss) (17.6 ) (8.8 ) (8.8 ) Other components of net periodic benefit cost (21.9 ) (31.0 ) 9.1 Other activity, net (3.3 ) (1.2 ) (2.1 ) Other income/(expense), net $ (36.4 ) $ (31.6 ) $ (4.8 ) Other income /(expense), net includes the results from activities other than normal business operations such as interest income and foreign currency gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity functional currency. In addition, we include the components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and post retirement obligations other than the service cost component. Other activity, net include costs associated with Trane U.S. Inc. (Trane) for the settlement and defense of asbestos-related claims, insurance settlements on asbestos-related matters and the revaluation of its liability for potential future claims. Provision for Income Taxes The 2018 effective tax rate was 16.9% which is lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the measurement period adjustment related to the change in permanent reinvestment assertion on unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, the deduction for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, the recognition of excess tax benefits from employee share based payments and a reduction in a valuation allowance for certain state net deferred tax assets. This decrease was partially offset by the measurement period adjustment related to a valuation allowance on excess foreign tax credits, U.S. state and local income taxes 24 Table of Contents and certain non-deductible employee expenses. In addition, the reduction was also driven by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate. Revenues from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounts for approximately 36% of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 38%. When comparing the results of multiple reporting periods, among other factors, the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate. The 2017 effective tax rate was 5.7% which is lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities, the premium paid related to the early retirement of certain intercompany debt obligations, the recognition of a claim for refund related to previously paid interest and the recognition of excess tax benefits from employee shared based payments. In the aggregate, these items decreased the effective tax rate by 37.9%. This decrease was partially offset by the transition tax cost, a change in permanent reinvestment assertion on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and a non-cash charge related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets in Brazil. In the aggregate these items increased the effective tax rate by 13.7%. In addition, the reduction was also driven by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate. Revenues from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounts for approximately 35% of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 38%. When comparing the results of multiple reporting periods, among other factors, the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate.

In addition, we include costs associated with Ingersoll-Rand Company for the settlement and defense of asbestos-related claims, insurance settlements on asbestos-related matters and the revaluation of our liability for potential future claims. A portion of the tax benefit (expense) in each period represents adjustments for certain tax matters associated with the 2013 spin-off of our commercial and residential security business, now an independent public company operating under the name of Allegion plc (Allegion).

Industrial Operating margin increased to 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with 10.1% for the same period of 2016 . The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes and favorable product mix. In addition, the segment benefited from productivity benefits in excess of other inflation, the non-recurrence of capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development that were reclassified to the income statement, pricing improvements in excess of material inflation and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. These amounts were partially offset by investments and restructuring spending. Unallocated Corporate Expense Unallocated corporate expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 13.0% or $30.4 million , compared with the same period of 2016 . The increase in expense primarily relates to costs associated with acquisition efforts, higher employee benefit costs and stock-based compensation as well as planned incubator investments in technologies that benefit our business. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $ 5.7 million compared with the same period of 2016 . The decrease relates primarily to changes in short-term financing arrangements and other items.

Other activity, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a charge of $16.4 million for the settlement of a lawsuit originally filed by a customer in 2012. The lawsuit related to a commercial HVAC contract entered into in 2001, prior to our acquisition of Trane. The charge represents the settlement and related legal costs recognized during the fourth quarter of 2016. 27 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The 2017 effective tax rate was 5.7% which is lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities, the premium paid related to the early retirement of certain intercompany debt obligations, the recognition of a claim for refund related to previously paid interest and the recognition of excess tax benefits from employee shared based payments. In the aggregate, these items decreased the effective tax rate by 37.9%. This decrease was partially offset by the transition tax cost, a change in permanent reinvestment assertion on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and a non-cash charge related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets in Brazil. In the aggregate these items increased the effective tax rate by 13.7%. In addition, the reduction was also driven by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate. Revenues from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounts for approximately 35% of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 38%. When comparing the results of multiple reporting periods, among other factors, the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate. The 2016 effective tax rate was 16.2% which is lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the tax treatment of the Hussmann gain. The gain, which is not subject to tax under the relevant local tax laws, decreased the effective tax rate by 4.8%. In addition, the reduction was also driven by earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective tax rate. Revenues from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounts for approximately 35% of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 38%. When comparing the results of multiple reporting periods, among other factors, the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate.

In addition, we include costs associated with Ingersoll-Rand Company for the settlement and defense of asbestos-related claims, insurance settlements on asbestos-related matters and the revaluation of its liability for potential future claims. For the year ended December 31, 2016, ongoing costs were more than offset by asbestos-related settlements with various insurance carriers. A portion of the tax benefit (expense) in each period represents adjustments for certain tax matters associated with the 2013 spin-off of our commercial and residential security business, now an independent public company operating under the name of Allegion. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. In doing so, we review and analyze our current cash on hand, the number of days our sales are outstanding, inventory turns, capital expenditure commitments and income tax payments. Our cash requirements primarily consist of the following: Funding of working capital Funding of capital expenditures Dividend payments Debt service requirements Our primary sources of liquidity include cash balances on hand, cash flows from operations, proceeds from debt offerings, commercial paper, and borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities. We earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the U.S. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the U.S. operations, the cash generated by our U.S. operations, our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our non-U.S. operations will be sufficient to fund our non-U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2018 , we had $903.4 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $689.7 million was held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries are generally available for use in our U.S. operations 28 Table of Contents via intercompany loans, equity infusions or via distributions from direct or indirectly owned non-U.S. subsidiaries for which we do not assert permanent reinvestment. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, additional repatriation opportunities to access cash and cash equivalents held by non-U.S. subsidiaries have been created. In general, repatriation of cash to the U.S. can be completed with no significant incremental U.S. tax. However, to the extent that we repatriate funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment to fund our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable non-U.S. taxes. As of December 31, 2018 , we currently have no plans to repatriate funds from subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment. Share repurchases are made from time to time in accordance with management's capital allocation strategy, subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements. In February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program (the 2017 Authorization) upon completion of the prior authorized share repurchase program. Repurchases under the 2017 Authorization began in May 2017 and ended in December 2018, completing the program. In October 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares upon completion of the 2017 Authorization. However, no material amounts were repurchased under this program during 2018. In June 2018, we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from $0.45 to $0.53 per ordinary share. This reflects an 18% increase that began with our September 2018 payment and an 83% increase since the beginning of 2016. We continue to be active with acquisitions and joint venture activity. Since the beginning of 2017, we entered into a joint venture and acquired several businesses, including channel acquisitions, that complement existing products and services further growing our product portfolio. In addition, we incur ongoing costs associated with restructuring initiatives intended to result in improved operating performance, profitability and working capital levels. Actions associated with these initiatives may include workforce reductions, improving manufacturing productivity, realignment of management structures and rationalizing certain assets. We expect that our available cash flow, committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund share repurchases, dividends, ongoing restructuring actions, acquisitions and joint venture activity. Liquidity The following table contains several key measures of our financial condition and liquidity at the periods ended December 31: In millions 2018 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 903.4 $ 1,549.4 $ 1,714.7 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt (1) 350.6 1,107.0 360.8 Long-term debt (1) 3,740.7 2,957.0 3,709.4 Total debt 4,091.3 4,064.0 4,070.2 Total Ingersoll-Rand plc shareholders equity 7,022.7 7,140.3 6,643.8 Total equity 7,064.8 7,206.9 6,718.3 Debt-to-total capital ratio 36.7 % 36.1 % 37.7 % (1) During the first quarter of 2018, the Company redeemed its 6.875% senior notes due 2018 and its 2.875% senior notes due 2019. In addition, the Company issued $1.15 billion principal amount of senior notes during February 2018. Debt and Credit Facilities Our short-term obligations primarily consists of current maturities of long-term debt. In addition, we have outstanding $343.0 million of fixed rate debentures that contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, we are obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder option, the outstanding principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) of the debentures held by the holder. We also maintain a commercial paper program which is used for general corporate purposes. Under the program, the maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, is $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 . We had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of our short-term obligations. Our long-term obligations primarily consist of long-term debt with final maturity dates ranging between 2020 and 2048. In addition, we maintain two 5-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit facilities. Each senior unsecured credit facility, one of which matures in March 2021 and the other in April 2023, provides support for our commercial paper program and can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Total commitments of $ 2.0 billion were unused at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . See Note 7 and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of our long-term obligations and their related guarantees. 29 Table of Contents Pension Plans Our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Our approach to asset allocation is to increase fixed income assets as the plan's funded status improves. We monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance. In addition, we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis. None of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pensions. Cash Flows The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended December 31, respectively. For additional details, please see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In millions 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities $ 1,474.5 $ 1,561.6 $ 1,433.0 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (629.4 ) (374.7 ) 240.1 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,378.8 ) (1,432.5 ) (726.9 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,474.5 million , of which net income provided $1,662.0 million after adjusting for non-cash transactions. Changes in other assets and liabilities used $187.5 million . Improvements in accounts payable were offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,561.6 million , of which net income provided $1,642.1 million after adjusting for non-cash transactions. Changes in other assets and liabilities used $80.5 million . Improvements in accounts payable were offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1,433.0 million , of which net income provided $1,449.8 million after adjusting for non-cash transactions. Changes in other assets and liabilities used $16.8 million . Improvements in accounts payable were offset by higher accounts receivable balances. Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities represents inflows and outflows regarding the purchase and sale of assets. Primary activities associated with these items include capital expenditures, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, acquisitions, investments in joint ventures and divestitures. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $629.4 million . The primary driver of the usage is attributable to the acquisition of several businesses and the investment of a 50% ownership interest in a joint venture with Mitsubishi. The total outflow, net of cash acquired, was $285.2 million . Other outflows included capital expenditures which totaled $ 365.6 million . Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $374.7 million . The primary driver of the outflow is attributable to capital expenditures of $221.3 million . In addition, we acquired several businesses that complement existing products and services. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $157.6 million during the year. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $240.1 million . The primary driver of the inflow is attributable to the proceeds of $422.5 million received from the sale of our Hussmann equity interest. This amount was partially offset by capital expenditures during the year. Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities represent inflows and outflows that account for external activities affecting equity and debt. Primary activities associated with these actions include paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing our own shares, issuing our stock and debt transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2018 , net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $1,378.8 million . Primary drivers of the cash outflow related to the repurchase of 9.7 million ordinary shares totaling $900.2 million and $479.5 million of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders. In addition, we issued $1.15 billion of senior notes which was predominately offset by the redemption of $1.1 billion of senior notes. During the year ended December 31, 2017 , net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $1,432.5 million . Primary drivers of the cash outflow related to the repurchase of 11.8 million ordinary shares totaling $1,016.9 million and $430.1 million of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $726.9 million . Primary drivers of the cash outflow related to the repurchase of 4.9 million ordinary shares totaling $250.1 million and $348.6 million of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders. In addition, we repaid our outstanding commercial paper balance during the year. 30 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Cash flows from discontinued operations primarily represent ongoing costs associated with postretirement benefits, product liability and legal costs from previously sold businesses. Net cash used in discontinued operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $66.7 million and primarily related to ongoing costs. Net cash used in discontinued operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $38.1 million. Ongoing costs were partially offset by asbestos-related settlements reached with various insurance carriers during the year. Net cash provided by discontinued operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $88.9 million and included asbestos-related settlements reached with various insurance carriers during the year as well as cash proceeds on the sale of property related to a previously sold business. These amounts more than offset ongoing costs. Capital Resources Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated from our operations, our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, upcoming debt maturities, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures were $ 365.6 million , $ 221.3 million and $ 182.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity, reduce costs, provide environmental enhancements, upgrade information technology infrastructure and security and advanced technologies for existing facilities. The capital expenditure program for 2019 is estimated to be approximately $300 million, including amounts approved in prior periods. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges. For financial market risk impacting the Company, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk." Capitalization In addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow, we maintain significant credit availability under our Commercial Paper Program. Our ability to borrow at a cost-effective rate under the Commercial Paper Program is contingent upon maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2018 , our credit ratings were as follows: Short-term Long-term Moody P-2 Baa2 Standard and Poor A-2 BBB The credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debt-to-total capital covenant of 65%. As of December 31, 2018 , our debt-to-total capital ratio was 36.7% and significantly beneath this limit. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment period: In millions Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years More than 5 years Total Short-term debt $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt 350.6 (a) 740.2 715.0 2,314.7 $ 4,120.5 Interest payments on long-term debt 186.5 355.1 298.6 1,394.0 2,234.2 Purchase obligations 946.0 946.0 Operating leases 197.1 259.4 110.6 42.7 609.8 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,680.2 $ 1,354.7 $ 1,124.2 $ 3,751.4 $ 7,910.5 (a) Includes $343.0 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder. The scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028. Future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, environmental, asbestos-related, and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above. 31 Table of Contents Pensions At December 31, 2018 , we had a net unfunded liability of $ 698.4 million , which consists of noncurrent pension assets of $ 49.9 million and current and non-current pension benefit liabilities of $ 748.3 million . It is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently project that we will contribute approximately $ 104 million to our plans worldwide in 2019 . The timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plan, which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates, returns on underlying assets, and other factors. Therefore, pension contributions have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pensions. Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions At December 31, 2018 , we had postretirement benefit obligations of $ 442.7 million . We fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately $ 46 million in 2019 . Because benefit payments are not required to be funded in advance, and the timing and amounts of future payments are dependent on the cost of benefits for retirees covered by the plan, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding postretirement benefits other than pensions. Income Taxes At December 31, 2018 , we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of $ 83.0 million and $ 20.7 million of related accrued interest and penalties, net of tax. The liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits. Contingent Liabilities We are involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental, asbestos-related, and product liability matters. We believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. Because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingent liabilities. Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from these estimates. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical. Allowance for doubtful accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which represents our best estimate of probable loss inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. This estimate is based upon our two step policy that results in the total recorded allowance for doubtful accounts. The first step is to record a portfolio reserve based on the aging of the outstanding accounts receivable portfolio and our historical experience with our end markets, customer base and products. The second step is to create a specific reserve for significant accounts as to which the customer's ability to satisfy their financial obligation to us is in doubt due to circumstances such as bankruptcy, deteriorating operating results or financial position. In these circumstances, management uses its judgment to record an allowance based on the best estimate of probable loss, factoring in such considerations as the market value of collateral, if applicable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the statement of operations in the period that they are determined. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. These assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset. 32 Table of Contents Impairment of goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test under ASC 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other," (ASC 350). For those reporting units that bypass or fail the qualitative assessment, the test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value is determined using three valuation techniques: a discounted cash flow model (an income approach), a market-adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (a market approach), and a similar transactions method (also a market approach). The discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing, growth and margins, with due consideration given to forecasting risk. The earnings and revenue multiple approach reflects the market's expectations for future growth and risk, with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units. The similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries. These valuation techniques are weighted 50%, 40% and 10%, respectively. Impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. For those indefinite-lived assets where it is required, a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach) which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value would be recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. The determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit. For our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2018, we calculated the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles. Based on the results of these calculations and further outlined below, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. Goodwill - Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 14.0% and terminal growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.5%. Under the guideline public company method, we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 6.5 to 13.5 of projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. For all reporting units except one in Latin America, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 75%. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units. The one reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 75% exceeded its carrying value by 1.1%. The reporting unit, reported within the Climate segment, has approximately $190 million of goodwill at the testing date. With all other assumptions and trends remaining constant for each independent variable, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate combined with a 0.5% decrease in the long-term growth rate would result in an approximate $15 million impairment for this reporting unit. Other Indefinite-lived intangible assets - In testing our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 15.5%, terminal growth rates of 3.0%, and royalty rates ranging from 0.5% to 4.5%. For all tradenames, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 74%, with the exception of one. The tradename, reported within our Climate segment, had an excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value of approximately 19% (9% in 2017) and an approximate carrying value of $15 million at December 31, 2018. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames. In addition, the Company has three recently acquired tradenames now subject to our annual impairment test. Combined, these tradenames have a carrying value of approximately $14 million, each with an estimated fair value over carrying value of under 10% 33 Table of Contents as expected. Due to their recent valuation upon acquisition, small variations in our estimates and assumptions could impact their fair value. Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be generated. Impairment in the carrying value of an asset would be recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations. Loss contingencies Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental and asbestos matters and product liability, product warranty, worker compensation and other claims. We have recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows for any year. Asbestos matters Certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. We record a liability for our actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. Asbestos-related defense costs are excluded from the asbestos claims liability and are recorded separately as services are incurred. None of our existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. We record certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within Discontinued operations, net of tax , as they relate to previously divested businesses, except for amounts associated with Trane asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries which are recorded within continuing operations. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding asbestos-related matters. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service promised in a contract (i.e., performance obligation) is transferred to a customer. Control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service. A majority of our revenues are recognized at a point-in-time as control is transferred at a distinct point in time per the terms of a contract. However, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract. We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Refer to Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 11, "Revenue" for additional information related to the adoption of ASC 606. The transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from a customer. To determine the transaction price, variable and noncash consideration are assessed as well as whether a significant financing component exists. Our contracts with customers, dealers and distributors include several forms of sales incentive programs (variable consideration) which are estimated and included in the transaction price. They include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount. We record an accrual (contra receivable) and a sales deduction for our best estimate determined using the expected value method. In addition, sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as variable consideration. All other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level, remain a customer for a certain period of time, provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability for our best estimate determined using the expected value method. We consider historical data in determining our best estimates of variable consideration. These estimates are reviewed regularly for appropriateness, considering also whether the estimates should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue recognition in a future period. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates of variable consideration, the revisions are included in the results for the period in which they become known through a cumulative effect adjustment to revenue. We enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple goods and services, such as equipment, installation and extended warranties. For these arrangements, each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation. The total transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price at the inception of the arrangement. If available, we utilize observable prices for goods or services sold separately to similar customers in similar circumstances to determine its relative standalone selling price. Otherwise, list prices are used if they are determined to be representative of standalone selling prices. If neither of these items are available at contract inception, judgment may be required and we will estimate standalone selling price based on our best estimate. We recognize revenue for delivered goods or services when the delivered good or service is distinct, 34 Table of Contents control of the good or service has transferred to the customer, and only customary refund or return rights related to the goods or services exist. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not. We regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, we record a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit. The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters. We will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved. Employee benefit plans We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retirees, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods. We review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. The discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date. The rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan investment policy, the types of assets held and the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of each measurement date. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors. Changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost. Estimated sensitivities to the expected 2019 net periodic pension cost of a 0.25% rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows: the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $7.2 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately $6.7 million. A 0.25% rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2019 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.7 million and a 1.0% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost by approximately $0.4 million.
