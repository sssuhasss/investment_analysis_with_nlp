ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy, results of operations and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described below in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a publicly traded REIT focused principally on science-driven cluster formation. We are the leading provider of high-quality environmentally sustainable real estate, technical infrastructure services and capital to the broad and diverse life science industry. Client tenants include institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit institutions), pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, medical device, product, service, and translational entities, as well as government agencies. Our operating platform is based on the principle of clustering , with assets and operations located in key life science markets. In 2008, we: Executed 141 leases for approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet, up 37% over 2007. Completed redevelopment of multiple spaces at 14 properties aggregating approximately 335,000 rentable square feet of which approximately 88% was leased. Leased approximately 630,000 rentable square feet of redevelopment and development space. Reported operating margins at approximately 75%. Reported occupancy at 94.8%. Sold eight properties for approximately $86 million. Extended maturities of two secured notes payable aggregating approximately $256 million. Received LEED certifications for two buildings in the Eastern Massachusetts and San Francisco Bay markets. Closed 7.00% series D cumulative convertible preferred stock offering with net proceeds of approximately $242 million. 2008 demonstrated the strength and durability of our core operations providing office/laboratory space to the broad and diverse life science industry. Our operating results have been steady over the period from our initial public offering in May 1997 through December 31, 2008. Our core operating results were solid for 2008, during a period of an extraordinary and unprecedented United States and worldwide economic, financial, banking and credit market crises, the onset of a significant worldwide economic recession and drastic decline in consumer confidence and the consumer driven economy. Financial systems throughout the world have become illiquid with banks much less willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers. Consequently, there is greater uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing or capital on reasonable terms or on any terms. The current economic, financial and banking environment, worldwide economic recession and lack of consumer confidence have caused and mandated significant reductions to our capital expenditures across all areas of our business, including operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, development and construction. We intend to focus on preservation of capital while maintaining future long term growth prospects. We intend to significantly reduce our capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 while we focus on the completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating approximately 590,057 rentable square feet and our existing active development projects aggregating approximately 875,000 rentable square feet. Additionally, we intend to continue with pre-construction activities for certain land parcels for future ground-up/vertical above ground development in order to preserve and create value. These important pre-construction activities add significant value to our land for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of the buildings. 31 We also intend to be very careful and prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to our active ground-up/vertical developments. Future reductions in construction activities will reduce our capital expenditures. However, if construction activities (including pre-construction activities) cease, certain construction and or pre-construction costs, including interest, taxes, insurance, payroll and other costs, will be expensed as incurred. We also intend to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital structure over a multi-year period. During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt maturities. We expect the source of funds over several years for the repayment of outstanding debt to be provided by opportunistic sales of real estate, joint ventures and through the issuance of additional equity securities, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2008, we had identified three assets held for sale which have been classified in discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had 159 properties containing approximately 11.7 million rentable square feet of office/laboratory space including approximately 590,057 rentable square feet of space undergoing a permanent change in use to laboratory space through redevelopment. As of that date, our properties were approximately 94.8% leased, excluding spaces at properties undergoing redevelopment. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, our asset base contained properties undergoing ground-up development approximating 875,000 rentable square feet. The following table is a summary of our properties as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Number of Rentable Square Feet Annualized Occupancy Percentage Markets Properties Operating Redevelopment Total Base Rent (1) (1)(2) California Los Angeles Metro 1 31,343 31,343 $ 820 88.3% California San Diego 31 1,494,551 148,657 1,643,208 43,594 92.6 California San Francisco Bay 17 1,478,660 1,478,660 56,542 98.4 Eastern Massachusetts 38 3,147,365 308,931 3,456,296 116,017 96.7 New Jersey/Suburban Philadelphia 8 441,504 441,504 8,341 87.5 Southeast 13 621,586 65,834 687,420 12,446 94.7 Suburban Washington, D.C. 31 2,428,466 66,635 2,495,101 48,608 90.5 Washington Seattle 13 1,045,768 1,045,768 32,244 98.7 International Canada 4 342,394 342,394 8,773 100.0 Properties Continuing Operations 156 11,031,637 590,057 11,621,694 327,385 94.8 Properties Discontinued Operations 3 64,218 64,218 1,220 100.0 Properties Total 159 11,095,855 590,057 11,685,912 $ 328,605 94.8% (1) Annualized base rent means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2008 (using rental revenue computed on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP). Amounts exclude spaces at properties totaling approximately 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment. (2) Including spaces undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment, occupancy as of December 31, 2008 was approximately 90.0%. Our primary sources of revenue are rental income and tenant recoveries (consisting of reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses from certain tenants) from leases of our properties. The comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of our property development, redevelopment and acquisition activities. Of the 159 properties owned as of December 31, 2008, two were acquired in 2008 (the 2008 Properties ), 15 in 2007, 19 in 2006, and 104 prior to 2006. In addition, we completed the development of one property in 2007 (together with the 15 properties acquired in 2007, the 2007 Properties ), four properties in 2006 (together with the 19 properties acquired in 2006, the 2006 Properties ), and 14 properties prior to 2006. As a result of these development and acquisition activities, as well as our ongoing redevelopment and leasing activities, there have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for 2008 as compared to 2007, and for 2007 as compared to 2006. Our operating expenses generally consist of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses. 32 Leasing As of December 31, 2008, approximately 89% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. Additionally, as of December 31, 2008, approximately 92% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures and approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. The following table summarizes information with respect to the lease expirations at our properties as of December 31, 2008: Year of Lease Expiration Number of Leases Expiring Rentable Square Footage of Expiring Leases Percentage of Aggregate Leased Square Feet Annualized Base Rent of Expiring Leases (per rentable square foot) 2009 (1) 75 982,312 9.5% $30.55 2010 62 1,088,066 10.5 27.41 2011 70 1,700,099 16.4 29.21 2012 60 1,384,688 13.3 34.39 2013 50 1,057,435 10.2 31.67 2014 25 815,970 7.9 28.72 2015 14 688,865 6.6 29.60 2016 14 751,560 7.2 26.79 2017 12 600,032 5.8 36.73 2018 11 726,844 7.0 43.64 Thereafter 11 583,950 5.6 29.38 (1) Excludes 14 month-to-month leases for approximately 78,000 rentable square feet. Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely payments under its lease. Also, if tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to re-lease the space. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Consequently, we could lose the cash flow from the affected properties, which could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected properties. Redevelopment A key component of our long term business is redevelopment of existing office, warehouse or shell space as generic laboratory space that can be leased at higher rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing redevelopment at 13 properties. In addition to properties undergoing redevelopment, as of December 31, 2008, our asset base contained embedded opportunities for a future permanent change of use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment aggregating approximately 1.6 million rentable square feet. However, new commitments for significant additional redevelopment projects are not strategic priorities in the near term. See Item 2. Properties Redevelopment for a table summarizing our properties undergoing redevelopment as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, our estimated cost to complete was approximately $80 per rentable square foot for the 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment. Our final costs for these redevelopment projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including construction requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations and the amount of costs funded by each tenant. 33 There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete spaces undergoing redevelopment or initiate additional redevelopment projects. Redevelopment activities subject us to many risks, including delays in permitting, financing availability, engaging contractors, availability and pricing of materials and labor and other redevelopment uncertainties. In addition, there can be no assurance that, upon completion, we will be able to successfully lease the space or lease the space at rental rates at or above the returns on our investment anticipated by our stockholders. Development Another key component of our long term business is ground-up development projects. Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects where we expect to achieve appropriate investment returns. We generally have undertaken ground-up development projects only if our investment in infrastructure will be substantially made for generic, rather than tenant specific, improvements. As of December 31, 2008, we had five parcels of land undergoing ground-up development approximating 875,000 rentable square feet of office/laboratory space. We also have an embedded pipeline for future ground-up development approximating 9.6 million developable square feet of office/laboratory space. However, new commitments for significant additional ground-up developments are not strategic priorities in the near term. See Item 2. Properties Development for a table summarizing our major projects undergoing ground-up development as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, our estimated committed costs to complete was approximately $100 per rentable square foot for the 875,000 rentable square feet undergoing ground-up development. Our final costs for these development projects will ultimately depend on many factors, including construction requirements for each tenant, final lease negotiations and the amount of costs funded by each tenant. Our success with our development projects depends on many risks that may adversely affect our business, including those associated with: unprecedented and extraordinary worldwide negative economic, financial, and banking conditions; the onset of significant worldwide economic recession and lack of confidence; the seizure or illiquidity of credit markets; national, local and worldwide economic conditions; delays in construction; budget overruns; lack of availability and/or increasing costs of materials; commodity pricing of building materials and supplies; financing availability; changes in the life sciences, financial and banking industries; volatility in interest rates; labor availability and/or strikes; uncertainty of leasing; timing of the commencement of rental payments; changes in local submarket conditions; delays or denials of entitlements or permits; and other property development uncertainties. In addition, development activities, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, typically require a substantial portion of management time and attention. This may distract management from focusing on other operational activities. If we are unable to complete development projects successfully, our business may be adversely affected. 34 Critical accounting policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. REIT compliance We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Fair value On January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 establishes and requires disclosure of fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity own assumptions about market participant assumptions. The three levels of hierarchy are: 1) using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 2) significant other observable inputs ; and 3) significant unobservable inputs . Significant other observable inputs can include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Significant unobservable inputs are typically based on an entity own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Rental properties, net, properties undergoing development and redevelopment, and land held for development In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations ( SFAS 141 ), we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements, equipment, and identified intangibles (including intangible value to above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships and other intangible assets) based upon their relative fair values. The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an as if vacant basis. The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated carrying costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases, considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. 35 The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease or 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of acquired in-place leases are classified as leasing costs, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases. Rental properties, properties undergoing development and redevelopment, land held for development and intangibles are individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS 144 ), when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount. Impairment indicators for our rental properties, properties undergoing development and redevelopment, and land held for development are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to, significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, appropriate capitalization rates, construction costs, available market information, historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions that may affect the property and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred and that the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. Capitalization of costs As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost ( SFAS 34 ) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects ( SFAS 67 ), we capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment or construction of a project. Pursuant to SFAS 34 and SFAS 67, capitalization of construction, development and redevelopment costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are written off. Should development, redevelopment or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed. Accounting for investments We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in publicly traded companies are considered available for sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities ( SFAS 115 ), and are recorded at fair value. Fair value has been determined based upon the closing trading price as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of stockholders equity. The classification of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of investments sold is determined by the specific identification method, with net realized gains included in other income. Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest. Certain investments are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock and FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46, Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments . Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. Individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions exist which may indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. We use significant other observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs pursuant to SFAS 157 to determine the fair value of privately held entities. 36 Interest rate swap agreements We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the notional amount ). Interest received under all of our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ). The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( SFAS 133 ), we record our interest rate swaps agreements on the balance sheets at their estimated fair values with an offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized gains/losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. In accordance with SFAS 157, the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The analysis reflects the contractual terms of the swaps, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves ( significant other observable inputs ). The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using significant unobservable inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default. We have concluded as of December 31, 2008 that the fair value associated to significant unobservable inputs for risk of non-performance was insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swaps agreements and as a result, have determined that the relevant inputs for purposes of calculating the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements, in their entirety, were based upon significant other observable inputs pursuant to SFAS 157. These methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be realized. SFAS 133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities , establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such as our interest rate swap agreements. All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed highly effective under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. In accordance with SFAS 133, we formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as highly effective , the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings. Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives and other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in our consolidated balance sheets. We commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and unrealized deferred rent. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had no allowance for doubtful accounts. Discontinued operations We follow the provisions of SFAS 144 in determining whether a property qualifies as an asset held for sale and should be classified as discontinued operations . A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, 37 subject only to the terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as held for sale , its operations, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. A loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as held for sale . Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale . Impact of recently issued accounting standards In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities ( FSP EITF 03-6-1 ). FSP EITF 03-6-1 requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 applies to our fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009 and requires that all prior-period earnings per share data be adjusted retrospectively. Early adoption is prohibited. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) ( FSP APB 14-1 ) that affects the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments, such as our outstanding unsecured convertible notes, that may be settled wholly or partially in cash. FSP APB 14-1 requires that instruments within its scope be separated into their liability and equity components at initial recognition by recording the liability component at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component and attributing the remaining proceeds from issuance to the equity component. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its initial fair value will be amortized to interest expense using the interest method. In addition, FSP APB 14-1 requires that the interest cost for our unsecured convertible notes be accounted for based on our unsecured nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. FSP APB 14-1 applies to our fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009 and requires retrospective application to all periods presented with early adoption prohibited. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on periods prior to those presented will be recognized as of the beginning of the first period presented. An offsetting adjustment will be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period, presented separately. Once adopted, we expect an increase in our non-cash interest expense associated with our $460 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of unsecured convertible notes that were issued in January 2007, including non-cash interest expense for prior periods (2007 and 2008) as a result of its retrospective application. The aggregate retrospective application of both FSP EITF 03-6-1 and FSP APB 14-1 will lower our reported earnings per share (diluted) by approximately 20 cents for the year ended December 31, 2008. In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( SFAS 162 ), the objective of which is to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with GAAP for nongovernment entities. Prior to the issuance of SFAS 162, GAAP hierarchy was defined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ( AICPA ) Statement on Auditing Standards 69, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( SAS 69 ). SAS 69 has been criticized because it is not directed to the entity, but directed to the entity independent public accountants. SFAS 162 addresses these issues by establishing that the GAAP hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity (not its independent public accountants) that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with GAAP. SFAS 162 was effective 60 days following the Securities and Exchange Commission approval on September 16, 2008, of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles . The adoption of SFAS 162 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 ( SFAS 161 ), to enhance disclosures about an entity derivative and hedging activities. SFAS 161 requires that objectives for using 38 derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation. SFAS 161 requires that the entity disclose the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses as well as the credit risk related contingent features. SFAS 161 applies to our fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 161 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (R), Business Combinations ( SFAS 141R ), to create greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. SFAS 141R requires a company to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity to be measured at their fair values as of the acquisition date. SFAS 141R also requires companies to recognize the fair value of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. In addition, SFAS 141R requires that acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 141R on January 1, 2009 could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our practice prior to adoption of SFAS 141R of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS 160 ). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements , and requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial statements, but separate from the parent shareholders equity. SFAS 160 also requires any acquisitions or dispositions of noncontrolling interests that do not result in a change of control to be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, SFAS 160 requires that a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated upon a change in control. SFAS 160 applies to our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2009 and will be adopted prospectively. The presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 160 will result in a reclassification of minority interest to a separate component of total equity and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest will no longer be treated as a reduction to net income but will be shown as a reduction from net income in calculating net income available to common stockholders. Additionally, upon adoption, any future purchase or sale of interest in an entity that results in a change of control may have a material impact on our financial statements as our interest in the entity will be recognized at fair value with gains or losses included in net income. The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact to our diluted earnings per share. 39 Results of operations Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007 Rental revenues increased by $48.0 million, or 16%, to $348.0 million for 2008 compared to $300.0 million for 2007. The increase resulted primarily from the 2007 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2008 Properties. In addition, in 2008, we recognized additional rental income aggregating $11.3 million primarily related to a modification of a lease for a property in South San Francisco, California. Tenant recoveries increased by $19.2 million, or 23%, to $101.4 million for 2008 compared to $82.2 million for 2007. The increase resulted primarily from the 2007 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2008 Properties. Other income from 2008 and 2007 of $11.2 million and $14.8 million, respectively represents construction management fees, interest, investment income and storage income. As a percentage of total revenues, other income for 2008 remained relatively consistent at approximately 2% to 4% of total revenues. Rental operating expenses increased by $17.4 million, or 18%, to $114.5 million for 2008 compared to $97.1 million for 2007. The increase resulted primarily from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily property taxes and utilities) from properties developed, redeveloped and acquired in 2008 and 2007. The majority of the increase in rental operating expenses was recoverable from our tenants. General and administrative expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 8%, to $34.8 million for 2008 compared to $32.3 million for 2007, primarily due to the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including internationally. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for 2008 remained consistent with 2007 at approximately 8%. Interest expense decreased by $7.3 million, or 9%, to $78.8 million for 2008 compared to $86.1 million for 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit due to the issuance of 10.0 million shares of our Series D Preferred Stock in March and April 2008. Additionally, the decrease resulted from a decrease in LIBOR rates. These decreases were partially offset by increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit. These borrowings were utilized to finance the development, redevelopment and acquisition of the 2007 Properties and 2008 Properties. The weighted average interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, decreased from approximately 5.85% as of December 31, 2007 to approximately 4.30% as of December 31, 2008. We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rate Swap Agreements ). Depreciation and amortization increased by $13.2 million, or 14%, to $108.2 million for 2008 compared to $95.0 million for 2007. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2007 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2008 Properties. During 2008, we recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $13.3 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the value of certain investments below their carrying value. Income from discontinued operations of $15.6 million for 2008 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2008 and eight properties sold during 2008. In connection with the properties sold in 2008, we recorded a gain of approximately $20.4 million. In accordance with SFAS 144, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4,650,000 in March 2008 related to an industrial building located in a suburban submarket south of Boston and an office building located in the San Diego market which has been included in income from discontinued operations, net. These properties were sold later in 2008. Income from discontinued operations of $10.9 million for 2007 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2008, eight properties sold during 2008, and four properties and four land parcels sold during 2007. In connection with the properties sold in 2007, we recorded a gain of approximately $8.0 million. 40 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006 Rental revenues increased by $70.4 million, or 31%, to $300.0 million for 2007 compared to $229.6 million for 2006. The increase resulted primarily from the 2006 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2007 Properties. Tenant recoveries increased by $21.6 million, or 36%, to $82.2 million for 2007 compared to $60.6 million for 2006. The increase resulted primarily from the 2006 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2007 Properties. Other income increased by $3.0 million, or 26%, to $14.8 million for 2007 compared to $11.8 million for 2006, due to an overall increase in all sources of other income. Other income consists of construction management fees, interest, investment income and storage. Rental operating expenses increased by $29.3 million, or 43%, to $97.1 million for 2007 compared to $67.8 million for 2006. The increase resulted primarily from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily property taxes, insurance, and utilities) from properties developed, redeveloped and acquired in 2007 and 2006. The majority of the increase in rental operating expenses is recoverable from our tenants. General and administrative expenses increased by $6.3 million or 24%, to $32.3 million for 2007 compared to $26.0 million for 2006, primarily due to the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including internationally, from 158 properties with approximately 11.3 million rentable square feet as of December 31, 2006 to 166 properties with approximately 12.2 million rentable square feet as of December 31, 2007. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for 2007 remained relatively consistent with 2006. Interest expense increased by $17.0 million, or 25%, to $86.1 million for 2007 compared to $69.1 million for 2006. The increase resulted primarily from increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan, secured notes payable and outstanding indebtedness related to our unsecured convertible notes. These borrowings were utilized to finance the development, redevelopment, and acquisition of the 2006 and 2007 Properties. We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rate Swap Agreements ). Depreciation and amortization increased by $24.1 million, or 34%, to $95.0 million for 2007 compared to $70.9 million for 2006. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2006 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2007 Properties. Income from discontinued operations of $10.9 million for 2007 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2008, eight properties sold during 2008, and four properties and four land parcels sold during 2007. In connection with the properties and land parcels sold in 2007, we recorded a gain of approximately $8.0 million. Income from discontinued operations of $7.4 million for 2006 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2008, eight properties sold during 2008, four properties and four land parcels sold during 2007, and three properties sold in 2006. In connection with the properties sold in 2006, we recorded a gain of approximately $59,000. 41 Liquidity and capital resources Overview We expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. We also believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund recurring non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. We expect to meet certain long term liquidity requirements, such as for property development and redevelopment activities, scheduled debt maturities, and non-recurring capital improvements, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, long term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. Notwithstanding our expectations, financial markets have recently experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty. While this condition has occurred initially within the subprime mortgage lending sector of the credit market, financial systems throughout the world have become illiquid with banks no longer willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers. Consequently, there is greater uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit market in order to attract financing or capital on reasonable terms or at any terms. Our ability to finance our development and redevelopment projects and pending or new acquisitions, as well as our ability to refinance debt maturities, could be adversely affected by our inability to secure capital on reasonable terms, if at all. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We May Not Be Able to Obtain Additional Capital to Further Our Business Objectives and We May Not Be Able to Refinance Our Debt . The current extraordinary and unprecedented United States and worldwide economic, financial, banking and credit market crisis and the onset of a significant worldwide economic recession and drastic decline in consumer confidence have caused and mandated significant reductions to of our capital expenditures across all areas of our business, including operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and construction. We intend to focus on preservation of capital while maintaining future growth prospects. We intend to significantly reduce our capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 while we focus on the completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating approximately 590,057 rentable square feet and our existing active development projects aggregating approximately 875,000 rentable square feet. Additionally, we intend to continue with pre-construction activities for certain land parcels for future ground-up/vertical above ground development in order to preserve and create value. These important pre-construction activities add significant value to our land for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of the buildings. We also intend to be careful and prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to our active ground-up/vertical developments. Future reductions in construction activities will reduce our capital expenditures. However, if construction activities (including pre-construction activities) cease, certain construction and or pre-construction costs, including interest, taxes, insurance, payroll and other costs, will be expensed as incurred. We also intend to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital structure over a multi-year period. During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt maturities. We expect the source of funds over several years for the repayment of outstanding debt to be provided by opportunistic sales of real estate, joint ventures and through the issuance of additional equity securities, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2008, we had identified three assets held for sale which have been classified in discontinued operations. 42 As further discussed below, our principal liquidity needs are to: fund normal recurring expenses; fund current development and redevelopment costs; fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund principal and interest payments due under our debt obligations, including balloon payments of principal; and fund dividend distributions in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that our sources of capital for our principal liquidity needs will be satisfied by: cash on hand of approximately $71.2 million as of December 31, 2008; restricted cash to fund certain construction costs; cash flows generated by operating activities (for the year ended December 31 2008, we generated approximately $232.7 million of cash flows from operating activities); availability under our $1.9 billion unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (approximately $1.4 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2008); cash proceeds from new secured or unsecured financings; cash proceeds generated from potential asset sales; cash proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred equity or debt securities; and cash proceeds from joint ventures. Principal liquidity needs Contractual obligations and commitments Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 consisted of the following (in thousands): Payments by Period Total 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 Thereafter Secured notes payable $ 1,081,963 $ 94,998 $ 449,003 $ 87,401 $ 450,561 Unsecured line of credit 675,000 675,000 Unsecured term loan 750,000 750,000 Convertible debt 460,000 460,000 Estimated interest payments 427,627 115,380 180,670 91,906 39,671 Ground lease obligations 596,549 6,104 14,254 16,774 559,417 Other obligations 4,593 1,348 2,426 819 Total $ 3,995,732 $ 217,830 $ 2,071,353 $ 656,900 $ 1,049,649 Secured notes payable as of December 31, 2008 consisted of 29 notes secured by 64 properties and four land development parcels. Our secured notes payable require monthly payments of principal and interest and had weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.26% at December 31, 2008. Minority interest share of secured notes payable aggregated approximately $45.0 million as of December 31, 2008. The total book values of rental properties, net and properties undergoing development and redevelopment, and land held for development securing debt were approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, our secured notes payable were comprised of approximately $785.5 million and $296.4 million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively. Our unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one year period to October 2011. Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one year period to October 2012. 43 In January 2007, we completed a private offering of $460 million of 3.7% unsecured convertible notes that are due in 2027. See additional information under Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements regarding our ability to redeem these notes, the ability of the holders to require us to repurchase the notes and circumstances under which the holders may convert the notes. Estimated interest payments on our fixed rate debt and hedged variable rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 74% of our debt was fixed rate debt or variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements. See additional information regarding our interest rate swap agreements under Liquidity and Capital Resources - Interest Rate Swap Agreements . The remaining 26% of our debt is unhedged variable rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged variable rate debt have been excluded from the table above because we cannot reasonably determine the future interest obligations on variable rate debt as we cannot predict the applicable variable interest rates in the future. See additional information regarding our debt under Notes 5, 6, 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2008 included leases for 19 of our properties and three land development parcels. These lease obligations have remaining lease terms of 24 to 98 years, excluding extension options. In addition to the above, as of December 31, 2008, remaining aggregate costs under contracts for the construction of properties undergoing development and redevelopment and infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases approximated $292.2 million. We expect payments for these obligations to occur over the next four years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We are also committed to fund approximately $43.8 million for certain investments over the next six years. Capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs As of December 31, 2008, we had an aggregate of approximately 875,000 rentable square feet undergoing vertical ground-up construction and an aggregate of approximately 590,057 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements related to our properties, including expenditures related to our development and redevelopment projects aggregating approximately $540.8 million, $589.6 million and $274.0 million, respectively. These amounts include any payments for property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvement presented in the table on page 45. We expect our future property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements related to our life science properties to decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008. 44 The following table shows total and weighted average per square foot property-related capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Total Weighted Average 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Capital expenditures (1): Major capital expenditures $ 5,959,000 $ 405,000 $ 1,379,000 $ 575,000 $ 972,000 $ 2,628,000 (2) Recurring capital expenditures $ 4,763,000 $ 955,000 $ 648,000 $ 639,000 $ 1,278,000 $ 1,243,000 Weighted average square feet in portfolio 47,289,809 11,770,769 11,476,217 9,790,326 8,128,690 6,123,807 Per weighted average square foot in portfolio Major capital expenditures $ 0.13 $ 0.03 $ 0.12 $ 0.06 $ 0.12 $ 0.43 (2) Recurring capital expenditures $ 0.10 $ 0.08 $ 0.06 $ 0.07 $ 0.16 $ 0.20 Tenant improvements and leasing costs: Retenanted space (3) Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 7,334,000 $ 3,481,000 $ 1,446,000 $ 1,370,000 $ 324,000 $ 713,000 Retenanted square feet 1,253,087 505,773 224,767 248,846 130,887 142,814 Per square foot leased of retenanted space $ 5.85 $ 6.88 $ 6.43 $ 5.51 $ 2.48 $ 4.99 Renewal space Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 6,978,000 $ 2,364,000 $ 1,942,000 $ 957,000 $ 778,000 $ 937,000 Renewal square feet 3,100,551 748,512 671,127 455,980 666,058 558,874 Per square foot leased of renewal space $ 2.25 $ 3.16 $ 2.89 $ 2.10 $ 1.17 $ 1.68 (1) Property-related capital expenditures include all major capital and recurring capital expenditures except capital expenditures that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, or costs related to the redevelopment of a property. Major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and HVAC systems that are typically identified and considered at the time a property is acquired. (2) Major capital expenditures for 2004 included a one-time HVAC system upgrade at one property totaling $1,551,000 or $0.25 per square foot. (3) Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting. Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants. Approximately 92% (on a rentable square footage basis) of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing). In addition, we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures. Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies; property age; location and characteristics; the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted space); the involvement of external leasing agents; and overall competitive market conditions. We expect our future capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs, excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment, to be approximately in the range as shown in the table immediately above. 45 Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan We use our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital, construction activities and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Our $1.9 billion unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion unsecured line of credit and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $500 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had borrowings of $675 million and $750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately 4.30%. Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either (1) a LIBOR-based rate plus 1.00% to 1.45% depending on our leverage or (2) the higher of a rate based upon Bank of America prime rate plus 0.0% to 0.25% depending on our leverage or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months. Our unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one year period to October 2011. Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one year period to October 2012. Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial covenants, including, among others, the following (as defined under the terms of the agreement): leverage ratio less than 65.0%; fixed charge coverage ratio greater than 1.40; minimum book value of $800 million; and secured debt ratio less than 55%. As of December 31, 2008, we believe our two most restrictive financial covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan are the leverage and fixed charge ratios. Future changes in interest rates, our outstanding debt balances and other changes in our business, operations or financial statements may result in a default of these and other financial covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions, mergers and borrowings available under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan for developments, land and encumbered assets. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Aggregate unsecured borrowings may be limited to an amount based primarily on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties and our cost basis of development assets and land. Aggregate unsecured borrowings may increase as we complete the development, redevelopment, or acquisition of additional unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2008, aggregate unsecured borrowings were limited to approximately $2.5 billion. If net operating income from properties supporting our borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facilities decreases, our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will also decrease. Additionally, we may be required to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in order to maintain compliance with one or more covenants under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 50 lenders providing commitments under our $1.9 billion unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. During 2008, all lenders under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan funded borrowings requested under these agreements. In the future, if one or more of the lenders under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan fail to fund a borrowing request, we may not be able to borrow funds necessary for working capital, construction activities, dividend payments, debt repayment and monthly debt service and other recurring capital requirements. The failure of one or more lenders to fund their share of a borrowing request may have a material impact on our financial statements. We have risks associated with the maturity of our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. There may be fewer, if any, lenders willing to participate in future unsecured credit facilities and future commitments from lenders may be lower than existing commitments. In addition, key terms and covenants may be less favorable than existing key terms and covenants and we may not be able to raise capital to repay our outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facilities prior to or at maturity. Interest rate swap agreements We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the notional amount ). Interest received under all of our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. 46 The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Transaction Dates Effective Dates Termination Dates Interest Pay Rates Notional Amounts Effective at December 31, 2008 Fair Values June 2006 June 30, 2006 September 30, 2009 5.299% $ 125,000 $ 125,000 $ (4,288 ) December 2005 December 29, 2006 November 30, 2009 4.730 50,000 50,000 (1,801 ) December 2005 December 29, 2006 November 30, 2009 4.740 50,000 50,000 (1,805 ) December 2006 December 29, 2006 March 31, 2014 4.990 50,000 50,000 (7,138 ) December 2006 January 2, 2007 January 3, 2011 5.003 28,500 28,500 (2,250 ) October 2007 October 31, 2007 September 30, 2012 4.546 50,000 50,000 (5,043 ) October 2007 October 31, 2007 September 30, 2013 4.642 50,000 50,000 (5,987 ) December 2005 January 2, 2008 December 31, 2010 4.768 50,000 50,000 (3,549 ) May 2005 June 30, 2008 June 30, 2009 4.509 50,000 50,000 (963 ) June 2006 June 30, 2008 June 30, 2010 5.325 50,000 50,000 (3,212 ) June 2006 June 30, 2008 June 30, 2010 5.325 50,000 50,000 (3,212 ) October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.622 25,000 25,000 (2,787 ) October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.625 25,000 25,000 (2,788 ) October 2008 October 10, 2008 December 31, 2009 2.750 75,000 75,000 (1,426 ) October 2008 October 16, 2008 January 31, 2010 2.755 100,000 100,000 (2,027 ) June 2006 October 31, 2008 December 31, 2010 5.340 50,000 50,000 (4,117 ) June 2006 October 31, 2008 December 31, 2010 5.347 50,000 50,000 (4,123 ) May 2005 November 28, 2008 November 30, 2009 4.615 25,000 25,000 (873 ) October 2008 September 30, 2009 January 31, 2011 3.119 100,000 (2,304 ) December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.015 75,000 (8,150 ) December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.023 75,000 (8,136 ) December 2006 December 31, 2010 October 31, 2012 5.015 100,000 (4,563 ) Total $ 953,500 $ (80,542 ) We have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from standard International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between us and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap agreements. In order to limit our risk of nonperformance of an individual counterparty under our interest rate swap agreements, our interest rate swap agreements are spread among various counterparties. As of December 31, 2008, the largest aggregate notional amount with an individual counterparty was $175 million. If one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate swap agreements, we will have risk of higher interest costs associated with our variable rate LIBOR-based debt. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, tenant security deposits and other assets at their fair values aggregating a liability balance of approximately $80.5 million and $26.9 million, respectively, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Balances in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap payments are made. During the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify approximately $33.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as an increase to interest expense. Secured notes payable As of December 31, 2008, we had aggregate secured notes payable of approximately $1.1 billion. If we are unable to refinance, extend principal payments due at maturity or pay principal maturities with proceeds from other capital sources, then our cash flows may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, even if we are able to refinance debt prior to maturity, the interest rate, loan to value, and other key loan terms may be less favorable than existing loan terms. Less favorable loan terms, assuming we are 47 able to refinance our secured notes payable, may result in higher interest costs, additional required capital as a result of less proceeds or lower loan to value upon refinancing, and new or more restrictive covenants or loan terms. Dividends We are required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred and common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such distributions are at the discretion of our board of directors. We may be required to use borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid dividends on our common stock aggregating approximately $101.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock aggregating approximately $10.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid dividends on our Series D Preferred Stock aggregating approximately $9.7 million. Sources of capital Cash and cash equivalents As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $71.2 million of cash and cash equivalents . Tenant security deposits and other restricted cash Tenant security deposits and other restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2008 2007 Funds held in trust under the terms of certain secured notes payable $ 16,118 $ 20,375 Funds held in escrow related to construction projects 49,499 23,727 Other restricted funds 2,165 7,809 Total $ 67,782 $ 51,911 The funds held in escrow related to construction projects will be used to pay for certain construction costs. Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 increased by $63.0 million to $232.7 million compared to $169.7 million for 2007. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in cash flows from operations and cash flows from overall changes in operating assets and liabilities. We believe our cash flows from operating activities provide a stable source of cash to fund operating expenses. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, approximately 89% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto and approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. We are largely dependent on the life science industry for revenues due under lease agreements. Our business could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by the current economic downturn and financial and banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the United States to other countries. Our tenants may not be able to pay amounts due under their lease agreements if they are unsuccessful in discovering, developing, making or selling their products or technologies. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property. If any of our tenants becomes a debtor in a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant lease. Any shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 48 Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 was $467.5 million compared to $931.3 million for 2007. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a lower amount of acquisition of properties. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2008 decreased by $468.8 million to $298.0 million compared to $766.7 million for 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, proceeds from the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock, secured notes payable, and borrowings from our unsecured line of credit of approximately $1.3 billion were offset by principal reductions of secured notes payable and our unsecured line of credit of approximately $919.5 million. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2008, we paid dividends on our common and preferred stock of approximately $101.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively. We also redeemed minority interests on two of our properties for approximately $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2007, proceeds from secured notes payable, unsecured convertible notes, borrowings from our unsecured line of credit, and issuance of common stock of approximately $2.1 billion were reduced by the redemption payments on our 9.10% cumulative redeemable series B preferred stock ( Series B Preferred Stock ), principal reductions of secured notes payable, and our unsecured line of credit of approximately $1.2 billion. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2007, we paid dividends on our common and preferred stock of approximately $90.0 million and $12.7 million, respectively. Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan We use our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital, construction activities and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Our $1.9 billion unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion unsecured line of credit and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $500 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had borrowings of $675 million and $750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately 4.30%. See additional information regarding our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan on page 46. Property dispositions During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold eight properties at an aggregate contract price of approximately $86.3 million. The net sales proceeds were initially used to repay outstanding secured debt related to the properties sold or outstanding debt on our unsecured line of credit. As of December 31, 2008, we had three properties classified as held for sale . Other resources and liquidity requirements Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions. In March 2008, we completed a public offering of 8,800,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The shares were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $213 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). In April 2008, we sold an additional 1,200,000 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock in an exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $29 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). The proceeds from this offering were used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit. The dividends on our Series D Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance. We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of $1.75 per share. Our Series D Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions and we are not allowed to redeem our Series D Preferred Stock, except to preserve our status as a REIT. Investors in our Series D Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights. On or after April 20, 2013, we may, at our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D Preferred Stock to be automatically converted if the closing sale price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds 150% of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series D Preferred Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to our issuance of a press release announcing the exercise of our conversion option. Holders of our Series D Preferred Stock, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their outstanding shares initially at a conversion rate of 0.2477 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $100.93 per share of common stock. The conversion rate for the Series D Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to certain dividends on our 49 common stock in excess of $0.78 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008, the Series D Preferred Stock had a conversion rate of approximately 0.2479 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $100.85 per share of common stock. In September 2007, we sold 2,300,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $96.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $215 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs). In February 2007, we called for redemption of our Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock was redeemed in March 2007 at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share plus $0.4107639 per share representing accumulated and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. In accordance with FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings Per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock , we recorded a charge of approximately $2,799,000 to net income available to common stockholders for costs related to the redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock. In January 2007, we completed a private offering of $460 million of the Notes that are due in 2027 with a coupon of 3.70%. The net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters discount, were approximately $450.8 million. Prior to January 15, 2012, we will not have the right to redeem the Notes, except to preserve our qualification as a REIT. On and after that date, we have the right to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. Holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes, in whole or in part, on January 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date. At issuance, the Notes had an initial conversion rate of approximately 8.4774 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes representing a conversion price of approximately $117.96 per share of our common stock. This initial conversion price represented a premium of 20% based on the last reported sale price of $98.30 per share of our common stock on January 10, 2007. The conversion rate of the Notes is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.74 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008, the Notes had a conversion rate of approximately 8.5070 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $117.55 per share of our common stock. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock prior to the stated maturity of the Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) the Notes will be convertible during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2007, if the closing sale price of our common stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) the Notes will be convertible during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the Note Measurement Period ) in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average conversion value of the Notes during the Note Measurement Period; (3) the Notes will be convertible upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, including a change in control, certain merger or consolidation transactions or the liquidation of the Company; (4) the Notes will be convertible if we call the Notes for redemption; and (5) the Notes will be convertible at any time from, and including, December 15, 2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15, 2027 or earlier redemption or repurchase. The Note Measurement Period is the five consecutive trading day period following a request by a holder of the Notes to convert his Notes. We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in a limited partnership and in limited liability companies which we consolidate in our financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2008, these third parties contributed equity aggregating approximately $1.1 million for their interest in these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction related activities. 50 Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2008, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Exposure to environmental liabilities In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties. Inflation As of December 31, 2008, approximately 89% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. Approximately 94% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. 51 Funds from operations GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of NAREIT established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among REITs. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the White Paper ) and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows above for information regarding these measures of cash flow). The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to funds from operations available to common stockholders (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Net income available to common stockholders $ 98,644 $ 78,905 Add: Depreciation and amortization (1) 108,743 97,335 Minority interest 3,799 3,669 Less: Gain on sales of property (2) (20,401 ) (7,976 ) FFO allocable to minority interest (4,108 ) (3,733 ) Funds from operations available to common stockholders $ 186,677 $ 168,200 (1) Includes depreciation and amortization on assets held for sale reflected as discontinued operations (for the periods prior to when such assets were classified as held for sale ). (2) Gain on sales of property relates to eight properties sold during 2008 and four properties and four land parcels sold during 2007. Gain on sales of property is included in the consolidated statements of income in income from discontinued operations, net. 52
