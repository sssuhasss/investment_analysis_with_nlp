Item 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page 6 of this Report. Executive Overview Schlumberger consists of two business segments: Oilfield Services and WesternGeco. Oilfield Services experienced strong growth in 2005 with a sharp rise in operating margins due to increasing activity, strong pricing momentum and accelerated technology introduction. Oil prices ended the year 41% higher than at the beginning of the year, while natural gas prices surged 82% over the same period. In the United States, the absence of a meaningful increase in natural gas production supported strong natural gas prices in 2005, which averaged more than $9 per MMBtu in 2005. Additionally, the devastating hurricane season resulted in a severe disruption of the already stretched United States oil industry. Eastern Hemisphere activity grew significantly but is still at a fairly early stage with the supply response only now translating into increased exploration, development and production maintenance operations in key international areas such as Russia and the Middle East. Internationally, projects ramped up throughout the year, supporting a steady growth in 2005. Growing levels of activity and increasing preparations for new projects in the Eastern Hemisphere indicate a trend that is expected to continue in 2006. WesternGeco delivered excellent results. Demand for seismic acquisition, principally marine, as well as multiclient data indicate a strong renewed interest in exploration. The continued acceptance of Q technology resulted in impressive growth, which is expected to continue in 2006. In Russia, the cooperation and confidence established during the initial period of our minority holding of PetroAlliance Services Company Limited, Russia largest independent oilfield services company, has confirmed our belief that the company will play a major role in our continued expansion. Schlumberger acquired an additional 25% equity stake in PetroAlliance in 2005, bringing Schlumberger total ownership to 51%. Schlumberger initially acquired 26% in the second quarter of 2004. The acquisition of the remaining 49% of the company is expected to be completed in 2006, subject to performance requirements, regulatory approval, and other customary provisions. Recent seismic, logging and well testing contracts show a renewed interest in exploration in both new and existing areas. This shift, together with increasing customer spending, tightening service industry resources, and faster deployment of new technologies creates an environment in which Schlumberger is well positioned. Ongoing supply constraints and resilient demand growth support high-energy prices with OPEC giving the market strong signals that it considers the $50 to $70 range per barrel for WTI (West Texas Intermediate) to be appropriate. Limited spare production capacity combined with geopolitical tensions that threaten supply availability provide upside potential for oil prices. Supply problems may prove even more severe for natural gas as accelerated production decline rates, and limited ability to increase drilling activity, continue to challenge United States and Canadian gas producers. IEA (International Energy Agency) projections show oil demand growth continuing at an annual rate of about 1.8 million barrels per day to 2 million barrels per day through to 2010 to reach a total of approximately 92.5 million barrels per day. This represents an increase of nearly 9 million barrels per day over demand in 2005. The IEA also show supply capacity growth just matching demand growth in 2007, 2008 and 2010, with capacity growth managing to increase slightly faster than demand in 2006 and 2009. In short, based on the IEA numbers, the degree of spare upstream capacity is not expected to increase significantly before the end of the decade. 15 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Several trends will define activity in 2006. First, rig count increases will be largely limited to onshore work as the global offshore rig market will remain constrained until new builds are mobilized beyond 2006. Second, shortages of people and equipment across the industry are likely to result in cost inflation and project delays, placing a high premium on reliable suppliers of both technology and skilled personnel. Third, the technology that can improve the productivity of the limited base of skilled personnel will be in high demand. This is clearly demonstrated both by the success of Schlumberger Petrel* seismic-to-simulation software tools, and by growing acceptance of the remote monitoring of job execution to achieve superior performance from technology. Fourth, exploration activity, where Schlumberger has an unmatched portfolio of services, is expected to show a large increase in 2006 and to continue for a number of years. The industry has already recognized the need for an unprecedented effort to increase secure hydrocarbon supply. Plans are being put in place to achieve this, but it will take several years of sustained activity to develop the new production that can reliably replace today supply, much of which was developed during the up-cycle of the 1970s and 1980s. In addition, this new supply will generally come from smaller reservoirs and more hostile environments where Schlumberger is uniquely placed to meet the challenge. The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements . (Stated in millions) 2005 2004 % Change 2004 2003 % Change OILFIELD SERVICES Operating Revenue $ 12,648 $ 10,239 24 % $ 10,239 $ 8,823 16 % Pretax Segment Income $ 2,805 $ 1,801 56 % $ 1,801 $ 1,537 17 % WESTERNGECO Operating Revenue $ 1,662 $ 1,238 34 % $ 1,238 $ 1,183 5 % Pretax Segment Income $ 317 $ 124 155 % $ 124 $ (20 ) % Pretax segment income represents the business segments income before taxes and minority interest. Pretax segment income excludes corporate expenses, interest income, interest expense, amortization of certain intangibles, interest on post-retirement benefits, stock-based compensation costs and the Charges and Credits described in detail in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as these items are not allocated to the segments. Oilfield Services 2005 Results Revenue of $12.65 billion increased 24% in 2005 versus 2004. Both Latin America and Europe/CIS/Africa increased 27%, Middle East & Asia increased 22% and North America increased 21%. The strong activity levels around the world reflected the growing response to the current narrow margin of excess production capacity. Pretax operating income of $2.81 billion in 2005 was 56% higher than in 2004 demonstrating high demand for oilfield services and accelerating technology delivery. Both higher activity and stronger pricing contributed to the sharp increase in pretax operating margins that strengthened across all Oilfield Services geographical areas. Pricing showed strong improvement in North America and continued to make excellent progress internationally. Customer concern over the availability of certain services and products coupled with recognition of elements of cost inflation has led to inclusion of price-escalation clauses in longer-term contracts. Activity increased universally, with the largest growth recorded in the GeoMarkets in Canada; US Land; Peru/Colombia/Ecuador; Russia; Nigeria; Australasia; Saudi Arabia; and the Arabian Gulf. Both organic growth and acquisitions contributed to the more than 50% revenue growth in Russia in 2005 versus 2004. 16 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Demand for all Technologies increased sharply, but particularly for Well Services and Well Completions & Productivity services. Technology introduction accelerated during the year. The Scope* family of Drilling & Measurements services for improved drilling performance and enhanced formation evaluation, met growing acceptance as customers realized step changes in well-placement accuracy in several geographical areas. During the year Schlumberger also launched the Scanner Family* of wireline logging services, a revolutionary suite of downhole rock and fluid characterization measurements. North America Revenue of $3.76 billion increased 21% over 2004 mainly driven by Canada and US Land, which benefited from strong Well Services and Drilling & Measurements activity coupled with strong pricing improvements. The Canada GeoMarket experienced strong equipment and personnel utilization, higher pricing and increased demand for high-tier services. The robust growth in US Land resulted from the combination of positive trends in activity and favorable pricing. During the third quarter, activity was severely disrupted in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 25 days of operating time lost due to the disastrous hurricane season. Damage sustained by production platforms and mobile offshore drilling units led to reduced activity throughout the third quarter with some lingering effect in the fourth quarter. Pretax operating income of $933 million was 80% higher than in 2004 led by US Land and Canada. The steep growth was primarily due to double-digit price increases, particularly for Well Services, Wireline and Drilling & Measurements technologies. New technology introduction and continuing activity growth also contributed to these results. The severe hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico had an estimated impact of approximately $70 million in lost revenue, and $52 million in lost pretax operating income. Latin America Revenue of $2.21 billion in 2005 increased 27% over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Latin America South GeoMarkets. Mexico recorded significant revenue growth, mainly due to a high number of wells being completed on the Burgos project, coupled with an overall rise in third-party managed services revenue. Activity in Venezuela increased primarily from IPM and Well Services operations. During the year, continued progress was highlighted with the signing of a short-term renewable agreement with PDVSA in early 2005 for operations on the PRISA project. Discussions regarding the settlement of certain outstanding receivables were still on going at year-end. The Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket contributed significantly to the revenue growth due to the start of several new Drilling & Measurements contracts for the expanding customer base. The growth in the Latin America South GeoMarket was primarily driven by increased IPM activity, although Brazil experienced strong activity from the deployment of Drilling & Measurements and Wireline technologies. Pretax operating income of $330 million in 2005 increased 49% versus 2004. This strong increase in operating income resulted mainly from an improved drilling environment in Venezuela coupled with stronger operating efficiencies in Well Services and Drilling & Measurements services and across all GeoMarkets, particularly in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $3.53 billion in 2005 increased 27% over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the Russia and Nigeria GeoMarkets. 17 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Strong revenue increases were recorded offshore Nigeria and in deepwater West Africa GeoMarket operations mainly benefiting Well Completions & Productivity, Wireline, and Drilling & Measurements with the rapid market acceptance of Scope technology. The CIS reached a new revenue record at $1.17 billion, an increase of 42% over 2004. The significant increase in revenue in Russia was due to a combination of organic growth, and the impact of the acquisitions of PetroAlliance and the Siberian Geophysical Company. Organic growth in Russia was driven by a recovery in activity for Yuganskneftegaz during the first quarter, increased demand for stimulation and cementing services, strengthening of IPM operations, and robust uptake of new technology. Pretax operating income of $704 million in 2005 increased 57% compared to 2004. Nigeria and West Africa contributed significantly due to increased activity, pricing improvements, and accelerated technology deployment. Operating income in the North Africa GeoMarket also increased markedly due to the growing presence of international oil companies in the region. The North Sea GeoMarket was a strong contributor to operating income through increased drilling activity and strong demand for production technologies from Well Services and Wireline. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $3.03 billion in 2005 increased 22% over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the Australasia, Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Gulf GeoMarkets. The importance of the Middle East in responding to the current lack of spare production capacity is reflected in the strong activity plans that were implemented in the region in 2005. The marked revenue growth seen in the Saudi Arabia GeoMarket was principally due to the increase in rig count as Saudi Aramco continued to increase activity in line with their announced spending plans. East Africa & East Mediterranean GeoMarket growth was mainly due to the expanded market for Drilling & Measurements and the start of a new Wireline campaign. In the Gulf GeoMarket, the start-up of Wireline services for Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and burgeoning gas activity in Qatar also contributed to the revenue growth. The Arabian, the Gulf and East Africa & East Mediterranean GeoMarkets recorded revenue increases of more than 30% and operating income growth of more than 40%. The solid contribution from the Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines GeoMarket was mainly due to higher customer expenditures, improved pricing, and a move by several operators into increased deepwater exploration uniquely benefiting Schlumberger technologies. Activity in China strengthened throughout the year as a result of accelerated adoption of advanced Drilling & Measurements and Wireline technologies. Australasia experienced a robust revenue growth rate mainly due to rising development activity in offshore Australia combined with growing land-based activity in New Zealand. Pretax operating income of $871 million in 2005 increased 34% compared to 2004. The steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all GeoMarkets and significant price increases principally in Drilling & Measurements, Well Completions & Productivity, and Wireline Technologies coupled with the start up of new projects throughout the Area. Improved results of the Bokor integrated project in the Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines GeoMarket also contributed to the operating income growth. 2004 Results Revenue of $10.24 billion increased 16% in 2004 versus 2003. North America increased 18%, Middle East & Asia increased 19%, and Latin America increased 21%. Europe/CIS/Africa was up by 4%. Pretax operating income of $1.80 billion in 2004 was 17% higher than in 2003. 18 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Activity increased in almost all regions with the largest growth recorded in the GeoMarkets in India; Mexico; Russia; East Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean; and the Caspian. Russia continued to make impressive progress with growth exceeding our expectations despite the absence of any activity for Yuganskneftegaz at the end of the year. Demand for all Technologies increased, particularly for Drilling & Measurements technologies including the PowerDrive* and newly introduced PowerV* rotary-steerable systems as well as Wireline ABC* Analysis Behind Casing and PressureXpress* services. Increased demand for Well Services production technologies also contributed significantly to the growth. These technologies included the successful launch of the PowerCLEAN* system, an integrated solution for optimizing production through wellbore fill removal using coiled tubing. Well Completions & Productivity technologies also showed strong growth for production-based technology services, while IPM activity continued its expansion. The rate of new technology introductions is expected to accelerate over the coming two-year period. Offshore and deepwater activity in India utilizing Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Completions & Productivity technologies continued to drive significant year-on-year growth. Growth in India was supported by the award of a completion sales tender for subsurface safety valves and a three-year contract for wireline logging on onshore fields for ONGC valued at more than $125 million. During the year Schlumberger opened a Technology Hub on the campus of the Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas, Russia leading oil and gas educational establishment. The Hub complements other Schlumberger research and engineering activities in Russia. Shell International Exploration and Production BV and Schlumberger Information Solutions formed an alliance for the research and development of next-generation Smart Fields hydrocarbon development solutions. North America Revenue of $3.11 billion increased 18% over 2003 led principally by Canada and US Land, which benefited from the strong performance of most Technologies, coupled with pricing improvements particularly for Well Services. Growth in Canada was due to increased activity and substantially higher pricing. US Land delivered robust revenue growth primarily due to continued favorable oil and gas industry dynamics, the expansion of the unconventional gas market, an improved pricing environment as a result of tighter resource availability, and strong overall market demand combined with increasing demand for ABC technologies, and Drilling & Measurements PowerDrive rotary-steerable systems. These technology advances are demonstrating value and are helping drive activity while enabling price increases and efficiency gains. Pretax operating income of $519 million was 42% higher than in 2003 due mainly to increased operating leverage in US Land, with double-digit price improvements in Well Services and Wireline Technologies over 2003 averages. In Canada, increased activity coupled with sustained pricing improvements, and the favorable exchange rate effect led to a notable improvement in operating income. At the end of the year, the technology component of turnkey service revenue in the Gulf of Mexico was evaluated against our objectives but proved insufficient to outweigh the risk associated with the turnkey drilling business model. As a result, the decision was made to exit the activity. Latin America Revenue of $1.75 billion grew 21% over 2003 as all the GeoMarkets, except Venezuela, posted revenue increases. Record revenue in Mexico was mainly due to PEMEX drilling activity coupled with higher levels of IPM activity. 19 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Increasing demand for IPM services in Argentina, an increase in Wireline activity associated with the Peruvian jungle operations, and growing demand for rotary steerable systems in Brazil also contributed to the revenue growth. In Venezuela, revenue decreased slightly on lower activity with PDVSA due to ongoing contract negotiation on certain integrated projects. Pretax operating income of $221 million was flat over 2003. The substantial revenue growth did not materialize into higher operating income mainly because of a larger contribution of Schlumberger-managed third-party services on IPM projects in Mexico as well as an unfavorable revenue mix in Mexico. Additionally, throughout the year, certain barges in West Venezuela were partially idled while contractual negotiations continued with PDVSA. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $2.79 billion increased 7% over 2003 mainly due to Russia, the Caspian and West Africa with gains recorded in all Technologies led by Drilling & Measurements and Well Services. CIS revenue reached $825 million, a 33% increase over 2003. Activity was particularly sustained in Russia mainly due to the continued expansion of the customer base and the deployment of new production-related technologies. The revenue growth was tempered by the halt of activities for Yuganskneftegaz in Russia in the fourth quarter. However, successful redeployment of the equipment previously working for Yuganskneftegaz was completed by the end of the year. West Africa continued to deliver robust performance achieving record activity levels mainly due to the development of deepwater projects combined with price increases through the introduction of new services and increasing demand for Well Services and Well Completions & Productivity technologies. Pretax operating income of $447 million declined 3% over 2003 mainly due to persistent union strikes in Norway, redeployment costs and associated decreased operating efficiency in Russia, weak results in North Africa, and the appreciation of local currencies against the US dollar. These were partially offset by the continued strengthening of activity in Continental Europe and the Caspian. Middle East & Asia Revenue in 2004 reached $2.48 billion, increasing 19% over 2003. The GeoMarkets in the Middle East, Malaysia and India primarily drove the growth. Activity in Saudi Arabia was focused on increasing production capacity, which resulted in higher levels of drilling activity throughout the year. This trend is expected to continue in 2005. India reached record revenue with the ramp-up in deepwater activity for ONGC and deepwater exploration activity for Reliance Industries Ltd. Activity in Qatar continued to increase due to ongoing gas development projects in the North Field. Also contributing to the record revenue level was the start of a new fracturing campaign in Oman. Demand for Well Completions & Productivity technologies was particularly strong, mainly in the Gulf from projects with RasGas, in Saudi Arabia from the commissioning of the Abu Safah project, and in Malaysia from higher testing activities and artificial lift sales. Pretax operating income of $649 million increased 27% over 2003 primarily driven by India, due to a substantial increase in deepwater activity combined with strong technology deployment, the ramp up of favorable projects in the Gulf, improved pricing on contract renewals, and new technology introductions. Key technology solutions that were deployed included the CHDT* Cased Hole Dynamic Tester tool, part of the suite of ABC technology services, was used to identify a high-pressured zone in a depleted reservoir in China; to acquire pressures and fluid samples in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi; and to acquire samples and pressure readings in Malaysia. 20 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 In the Gulf, demonstrated service quality and the introduction of new technology services led to the award of major contracts in Qatar and Oman. These included a $320 million, multi-year wireline and tubing conveyed perforating contract by PDO for their North and South operations. WesternGeco 2005 Results Operating revenue for 2005 was $1.66 billion versus $1.24 billion in 2004. This strong performance was mainly attributable to the continued market acceptance of Q-Technology*, a higher level of Multiclient sales and improved operating leverage in Marine acquisition. Backlog reached an all-time high of $790 million at the end of 2005 compared to $670 million at the end of last year, reflecting increasing exploration and production budgets for 2006. Q-Technology revenues reached $399 million in 2005, representing 24% of total revenue in 2005, more than doubling the $162 million achieved in 2004. Utilization of the five Q-equipped vessels reached 93% in the fourth quarter of 2005. Q-Technology revenue is expected to grow by another 80% in 2006. Multiclient sales increased 17%, to $509 million, mainly in North America due to an especially strong Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale, higher sales in Asia, the Caspian, South America and West Africa reflecting an improved exploration-spending environment. Approximately 64% of the multiclient surveys sold in 2005 had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs, compared to approximately 52% in 2004 and only 7.7% of the revenue related to surveys that were impaired in 2003 and 2002. Marine activity grew 63% mainly from strong activity in the North Sea, Asia, India and the Gulf of Mexico, combined with higher vessel utilization, steady price increases and more favorable contractual terms regarding risk sharing with customers for downtime. Land activity increased 31% mainly in the Middle East reflecting higher activity in Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Kuwait. The Land seismic crew count increased from 18 at the end of 2004 to 24 at the end of 2005. Data Processing increased 14% reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q-processing, and higher activity in South America and Russia. Pretax operating income reached $317 million in 2005 compared to $124 million in 2004 due to accelerating demand for Q-Marine* coupled with improved pricing and increased vessel utilization, together with strong Multiclient sales. Driven by Q-Marine demand, WesternGeco announced plans to convert two more vessels to Q-Technology standards. The first, the Western Regent , was completed and began operations in June of 2005, while the second, Western Monarch , is expected to enter service in the second quarter of 2006. 2004 Results The revenue increase of 5% to $1.24 billion in 2004 from $1.18 billion in 2003 was mainly attributable to the successful expansion of Q-Technology together with strong Multiclient sales. Q revenues grew from $79 million in 2003 to $162 million in 2004. Multiclient sales increased 24%, to $436 million, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico driven by the renewed interest in the library resulting from a higher oil price environment and an increasing number of blocks in the Gulf of Mexico coming up for renewal. Approximately 52% of the multiclient surveys sold in 2004 had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs and only 5% of the revenue related to surveys that were impaired in 2003 and 2002. Land activity decreased 8% reflecting the completion of some projects in Malaysia and the Middle East, and the shutdown of several crews active in the previous year in Alaska, Mexico and West Africa. 21 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Marine activity declined 3% mainly as a result of the decision to reduce the number of vessels in the WesternGeco fleet, coupled with adverse weather in Latin America, lower activity in the Caspian and a high number of vessel transits at the end of the year. Marine activity in the first half of 2005 is expected to recover with higher vessel utilization and improved pricing. Data Processing increased 6% reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q processing, and robust third-party work, coupled with improved operational efficiencies. Pretax operating income reached $124 million in 2004 compared to a loss of $20 million in 2003 due to lower amortization cost following the impairments of the Multiclient library in 2003 and 2002 coupled with savings related to restructuring measures taken in 2003, accelerating demand for reservoir-focused Q-Marine activity together with strong Multiclient sales. Data Processing also contributed to this improvement due to better operating efficiency. The WesternGeco backlog at the end of the year reached $670 million, increasing 64% over 2003, of which 86% is committed over the next year. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Interest income $ 100 $ 56 $ 52 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 109 94 75 Gain on sale of facility in Montrouge, France 1 163 Gain on sale of Hanover Compressor investment 1 21 Loss on sale of Atos Origin shares 1 (21 ) Gain on sale of Hanover Compressor note 1 32 Gains on sales of other assets 15 7 $ 408 $ 129 $ 166 1. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding these items. Interest Income The average return on investment increased from 2% in 2004 to 3.3% in 2005 and the average investment balance of $3.0 billion in 2005 increased $297 million compared to 2004. The average return on investment in 2004 was 2%; a reduction of 0.4% compared to 2003, due to lower interest rates. The average investment balance in 2004 was $2.7 billion, an increase of $567 million over 2003. Equity in Net Earnings of Affiliated Companies The equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents Schlumberger share of the results of its 40% interest in a drilling fluids joint venture that it operates with Smith International Inc. Interest Expense Excluding the impact of the net $64 million charge in 2004 related to the United States interest rate swaps (see Charges and Credits), interest expense decreased $11 million in 2005 to $197 million. The weighted average borrowing rates increased from 3.9% in 2004 to 4.4% in 2005 while the average debt balance of $4.5 billion in 2005 decreased by $865 million compared to 2004. 22 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Interest expense in 2004 of $272 million included a net charge of $64 million related to the United States interest rate swaps; excluding the net charge, interest expense decreased $126 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a $2 billion decrease in average debt balances and a decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 4.6% to 3.9%. Other Gross margin was 25.8%, 21.2% and 15.9% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Charges and Credits noted on page 24 of this Report adversely impacted the gross margin by 0.4% and 4.7% in 2004 and 2003. Charges and Credits had an insignificant impact on the 2005 gross margin. Gross margin increased from 21.2% in 2004 to 25.8% in 2005 primarily due to a combination of record activity levels in Oilfield Services, with operations at capacity in a number of regions and continued pricing improvements in both Oilfield Services and WesternGeco. As a percentage of revenue, research & engineering, marketing and general & administrative expenses are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Research and engineering 3.5 % 4.1 % 4.3 % Marketing 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.5 % General and administrative 2.6 % 3.0 % 3.2 % Research and engineering expenditures, by segment, were as follows: (Stated in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Oilfield Services $ 451 $ 416 $ 375 WesternGeco 51 48 52 Other 4 3 4 $ 506 $ 467 $ 431 Income Taxes The reported effective tax rate, including Charges and Credits , was 22.9% in 2005, 20.9% in 2004 and 46.0% in 2003. The Charges and Credits noted on page 24 of this Report decreased the effective rate by 1.5% in 2005 and increased the effective tax rate by 0.4% in 2004 and 21.2% in 2003. The increase in the reported effective tax from 2004 to 2005 is primarily attributable to the country mix of results in Oilfield Services, which experienced a higher proportion of pretax profitability in higher-tax jurisdictions in 2005. This increase was mitigated primarily by the impact of the $163 million gain on the sale of the Montrouge facility. This transaction allowed for the utilization of a deferred tax asset that was previously offset by a valuation allowance. The decrease in the reported effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 was primarily the result of a significant amount of non-tax effective charges in 2003, including $168 million of charges related to the extinguishment of European debt, as well as changes in the country mix of earnings in WesternGeco. 23 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Charges and Credits During each of 2005, 2004 and 2003, Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The following is a summary of the 2005 Charges and Credits: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Net Income Statement Classification Charges & Credits Gain on sale of Hanover Compressor stock $ (21 ) $ $ (21 ) Interest and other income Gain on sale of Montrouge facility (163 ) (163 ) Interest and other income Other real-estate related charges 12 1 11 Cost of goods sold and services Net Credits $ (172 ) $ 1 $ (173 ) The following is a summary of the 2004 Charges and Credits: (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Net Charges & Credits: - Debt extinguishment costs $ 115 $ 14 $ 101 Debt extinguishment costs - Restructuring program charges 27 6 21 Cost of goods sold and services - Intellectual Property settlement charge 11 1 10 Cost of goods sold and services - Loss on sale of Atos Origin stock 21 21 Interest and other income - US interest-rate swap settlement gain (10 ) (4 ) (6 ) Interest expense - Vacated leased facility reserve 11 11 Cost of goods sold and services - Litigation reserve release (5 ) (5 ) Cost of goods sold and services - Loss recognized on interest-rate swaps 73 27 46 Interest expense Net Charges $ 243 $ 44 $ 199 The following is a summary of the 2003 Charges and Credits: ( Stated in millions ) Pretax Tax Min Int Net Income Statement Classification Charges & Credits: - Debt extinguishment costs $ 168 $ $ $ 168 Debt extinguishment costs - Gain on sale of Hanover Compressor note (32 ) (12 ) (20 ) Interest and other income - Impairment of Hanover Compressor stock 81 81 Cost of goods sold and services - Multiclient seismic library impairment 398 74 (120 ) 204 Cost of goods sold and services - Seismic vessel impairment 54 (16 ) 38 Cost of goods sold and services - Gain on sale of rig (31 ) (31 ) Cost of goods sold and services Net Charges $ 638 $ 62 $ (136 ) $ 440 Business Divestitures Discontinued Operations During 2003, Schlumberger began an active program to divest of all of its non-oilfield services businesses, which was completed in 2005. These divestitures, which were accounted for as Discontinued Operations , are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . As a result of these transactions, Schlumberger generated cash, including proceeds from the sale of securities received, of approximately $28 million in 2005, $2.93 billion in 2004 and $299 million in 2003. These proceeds have been primarily used to further Schlumberger deleveraging efforts. 24 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The following table summarizes the results of these discontinued operations: (Stated in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 8 $ 590 $ 4,367 Income (loss) before taxes $ (1 ) $ 55 $ 104 Tax expense 16 33 Gains (losses) on disposal, net of tax 9 171 (86 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 8 $ 210 $ (15 ) Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $40 million in 2005 and is currently estimated to be approximately $110 million in 2006. This increase will be principally due to (i) the adoption of FAS 123R, as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , which requires companies to expense the unamortized portion of stock options granted prior to 2003 when Schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, (ii) 2006 will be the first year that the full 4-year impact of the adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 (adopted by Schlumberger in January 2003), will be reflected in Schlumberger results and (iii) valuations of 2006 stock-based compensation awards are expected to increase due to the recent upward movement in Schlumberger stock price. During 2006, Schlumberger will relocate its United States corporate office from New York to Houston. Schlumberger will also relocate its United States research center from Ridgefield to Boston in 2006. Schlumberger currently estimates that it will incur approximately $25 million to $30 million in incremental expenses in connection with these moves in 2006. Cash Flow In 2005, cash provided by operations was $3.0 billion as net income plus depreciation & amortization were partly offset by increases in customer receivables and inventories, due to higher operating revenues. Cash used in investing activities was $2.04 billion and included investments in fixed assets ($1.59 billion) and multiclient seismic data ($60 million), the purchase of short-term investments ($707 million), proceeds from the sale of the Montrouge facility ($230 million) and the sale of the investment in Hanover Compressor ($110 million). Cash used in financing activities was $994 million with the proceeds from employee stock plans ($345 million) offset by the payment of dividends to shareholders ($482 million), the repurchase of 7.64 million shares of Schlumberger stock ($612 million) and an overall reduction in debt of $216 million. 25 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Net Debt is gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt, and that the level of net debt provides useful information as to the results of Schlumberger deleveraging efforts.

Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumberger significant accounting policies are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. Such costs are charged to Cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-lined amortized value. The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. Schlumberger recorded an impairment charge relating to the multiclient library of $398 million in 2003. The carrying value of the library at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $222 million, $347 million and $506 million, respectively. Following the 2003 impairment charge, Schlumberger will not generally commence a multiclient project unless the project is significantly pre-funded by one or more customers. The reduction in the carrying value of the library over recent years is primarily attributable to a cautious approach to new investment combined with the significant pre-funding requirement. 27 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices, customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. Inventory Reserves Schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by SFAS 142, Schlumberger reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco segment. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or applying various market multiples. From time to time a third party valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumberger estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. In order to estimate the fair value of a long-lived asset, Schlumberger may engage a third-party to assist with the valuation. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period. 28 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Investments Schlumberger and Smith International Inc. operate a drilling fluids joint venture of which Schlumberger owns a 40% interest and records income using the equity method of accounting. Schlumberger investment at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $802 million and $716 million, respectively. The carrying value of this joint venture is evaluated for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates that a decline in the fair value of this investment that is other than temporary has occurred. Fair value is generally estimated by comparing the significance of this joint venture to Smith International Inc., a publicly traded company, and then referencing the market capitalization of Smith International Inc. To date, Schlumberger has not recorded any impairment charges relating to this investment as this analysis has indicated that the fair value of this investment is significantly in excess of its carrying value. Income Taxes Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the year in which such resolution occurs. Schlumberger had net deferred tax assets of $564 million at December 31, 2005, which excluded $213 million relating to net operating losses in certain countries for which there is a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for valuation allowances, Schlumberger considers the likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. Contingencies The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous material where it is probable that Schlumberger has incurred a liability and such amount can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation. Due to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty of timing, the scope of remediation, future technology, regulatory changes, natural resource or property damage claims and other factors, it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated. However, in the opinion of management, any such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations. The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accruals for estimated future expenditures, relating to potential contractual obligations, associated with business divestitures which have been completed. It is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded. In the opinion of management, such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations. In December 2004, WesternGeco and Schlumberger received grand jury subpoenas from the United States Attorney office in the Southern District of Texas seeking documents relating to possible fraud in obtaining visas for non-United States citizens working as crewmembers on vessels operating in the Gulf of Mexico. We are in the process of responding to the investigation, including providing information sought by the subpoenas. Schlumberger is currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter and the related impact it might have on Schlumberger financial position and results of operations. 29 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate we use reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The discount rate utilized to determine both the accumulated benefit obligation ( ABO ) for Schlumberger United States pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ( APBO ) for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans was reduced from 6.00% at December 31, 2004 to 5.75% at December 31, 2005. The discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was reduced from 6.25% in 2004 to 6.00% in 2005. The change in the discount rate was made to reflect market interest rate conditions. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases expense. The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation, are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.50% in both 2005 and 2004. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in 2005 was 10% graded to 6% over the next six years and 5% thereafter. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in 2004 was 10% graded to 5% over the next five years and 5% thereafter. The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States pension plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2005 Pretax Pension Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2005 ABO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 6.6 +$64.7 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $ 6.4 -$62.6 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$ 3.2 $ 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets - $ 3.2 $ The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2005 Pretax Postretirement Medical Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2005 APBO 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 3.5 +$ 27.9 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $ 3.3 - $ 26.9 100 basis point decrease in medical cost trend rate - $ 11.5 - $ 103.5 100 basis point increase in medical cost trend rate +$ 14.4 +$ 126.2 30 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7A
