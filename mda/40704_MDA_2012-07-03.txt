ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our established products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our business. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our discussion of total segment operating profit, diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability and return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit; high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability; and improvements in return on average total capital. We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value creation for stockholders. We return a substantial amount of cash to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. Fiscal 2012 was a challenging year for us as well as the rest of the food industry, as we experienced double-digit input cost inflation and consumers were affected by the slow economic recovery around the world. For the fiscal year ended May 27, 2012, our net sales grew 12 percent and total segment operating profit grew 2 percent. Diluted EPS declined 13 percent and our return on average total capital declined by 110 basis points. Diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability increased 3 percent from fiscal 2011 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.4 billion in fiscal 2012, enabling us to partially fund the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. and to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 9 percent from fiscal 2011. We also made significant capital investments totaling $676 million in fiscal 2012. We achieved the following related to our three key operating objectives for fiscal 2012: Net sales growth of 12 percent was primarily driven by contributions from our Yoplait S.A.S. acquisition, volume gains in our International segment, and net price realization and mix. We increased marketing, merchandising, and innovation investment in support of our leading brands and continued to build our global platforms around the world. Our global advertising and media expense increased 8 percent, including investment in our core developed markets and continued media support behind our international Yoplait business. We achieved a 2 percent increase in total segment operating profit despite the high levels of input cost inflation. We continued to focus on our holistic margin management (HMM) program, which includes cost-savings initiatives, marketing spending efficiencies, and profitable sales mix strategies. 19 Details of our financial results are provided in the Fiscal 2012 Consolidated Results of Operations section below. Looking ahead, we expect slow improvement in the operating environment for food companies around the globe. Although we believe the consumer environment will remain challenging in fiscal 2013, we expect to deliver another year of quality growth. Excluding the effects of our pending acquisition of Yoki Alimentos S.A. (Yoki), we expect to achieve these results: We are targeting mid single-digit growth in net sales driven by acquisitions, volume growth, mix improvements, and modest net price realization. We have a strong line-up of consumer marketing, merchandising, and innovation planned to support our leading brands. We will continue to build our global platforms in markets around the world, accelerating our efforts in rapidly growing emerging markets. We are targeting mid single-digit growth in total segment operating profit in fiscal 2013, as we expect our HMM discipline of cost savings, mix management, and price realization to offset lower input cost inflation. Our businesses generate strong levels of cash flows and we use some of this cash to reinvest in our business. Our fiscal 2013 plans call for approximately $650 million of expenditures for capital projects, excluding expenditures that may be required for Yoki. On June 26, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.32 per share, an 8 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2012. We expect that share repurchases will at least offset normal levels of stock option exercises in fiscal 2013. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2012 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2012 net sales grew 12 percent to $16,658 million. In fiscal 2012, net earnings attributable to General Mills was $1,567 million, down 13 percent from $1,798 million in fiscal 2011, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.35 in fiscal 2012, down 13 percent from $2.70 in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 results include losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories versus fiscal 2011 which included gains. Fiscal 2012 results also include restructuring charges reflecting employee severance expense and the write-off of certain long-lived assets related to our 2012 productivity and cost savings plan and integration costs resulting from the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. Fiscal 2011 results include the net benefit from the resolution of uncertain tax matters. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability was $2.56 in fiscal 2012, up 3 percent from $2.48 in fiscal 2011 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2012 vs. 2011 Contributions from volume growth (a) 9 pts Net price realization and mix 3 pts Foreign currency exchange Flat Net sales growth 12 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales grew 12 percent in fiscal 2012, due to 9 percentage points of contribution from volume growth, including 12 percentage points of volume growth contributed by the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. Net price realization and mix contributed 3 percentage points of net sales growth. Foreign currency exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2011. 20 Cost of sales increased $1,686 million in fiscal 2012 to $10,613 million. This increase was driven by an $877 million increase attributable to higher volume and a $610 million increase attributable to higher inputs costs and product mix. We recorded a $104 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $95 million in fiscal 2011. Gross margin grew 2 percent in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased by 370 basis points from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. This decrease was primarily driven by higher input costs and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2012 versus gains in fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up $189 million in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2012 decreased by 1 percentage point compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. and an 8 percent increase in advertising and media expense. There were no divestitures in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2011, we recorded a net divestiture gain of $17 million consisting of a gain of $14 million related to the sale of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our International segment and a gain of $3 million related to the sale of a pie shell product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $102 million in fiscal 2012 as follows: Expense, in Millions Productivity and cost savings plan $ 100.6 Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 1.0 Total $ 101.6 In fiscal 2012, we approved a major productivity and cost savings plan designed to improve organizational effectiveness and focus on key growth strategies. The plan includes organizational changes that strengthen business alignment, and actions to accelerate administrative efficiencies across all of our operating segments and support functions. In connection with this initiative, we expect to eliminate approximately 850 positions globally and recorded a $101 million restructuring charge, consisting of $88 million of employee severance expense and a non-cash charge of $13 million related to the write-off of certain long-lived assets in our U.S. Retail segment. All of our operating segments and support functions were affected by these actions including $70 million related to our U.S. Retail segment, $12 million related to our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, $10 million related to our International segment, and $9 million related to our administrative functions. We expect to record approximately $19 million of restructuring charges as a result of these actions in fiscal 2013. These restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2012, we paid $4 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2012 and previous years. Interest, net for fiscal 2012 totaled $352 million, $6 million higher than fiscal 2011. Average interest bearing instruments increased $792 million in fiscal 2012, primarily due to the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S., generating a $46 million increase in net interest. The average interest rate decreased 55 basis points, including the effect of the mix of debt, generating a $40 million decrease in net interest. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 32.1 percent compared to 29.7 percent in fiscal 2011. The 2.4 percentage point increase was primarily due to a $100 million reduction to tax expense recorded in fiscal 2011 related to a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008. 21 After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2012 decreased to $88 million compared to $96 million in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher effective tax rates as a result of discrete tax items in fiscal 2012. The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Venture Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2012 vs. 2011 CPW 4 % HDJ 11 Joint Ventures 5 % In fiscal 2012, CPW net sales grew by 4 percent due to 3 percentage points attributable to net price realization and mix, and a 2 percentage point increase from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decrease from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In fiscal 2012, net sales for HDJ increased 11 percent from fiscal 2011 due to 7 percentage points of favorable foreign currency exchange, 3 percentage points due to an increase in volume, and 1 percentage point attributable to net price realization and mix. Average diluted shares outstanding increased by 2 million in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011, due primarily to the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises, partially offset by share repurchases. FISCAL 2012 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Cash and cash equivalents decreased $148 million from fiscal 2011, as discussed in the Liquidity section below. Receivables increased $161 million from fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. Inventories decreased $130 million from fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of inventory reduction efforts in fiscal 2012. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $125 million from fiscal 2011, mainly due to decreases in derivative receivable balances. Land, buildings, and equipment increased $307 million from fiscal 2011, as $676 million of capital expenditures and $252 million of additions from the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. were partially offset by depreciation expense of $512 million and $84 million of foreign currency translation in fiscal 2012. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased $2,323 million from fiscal 2011 primarily due to the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. We recorded $1,617 million of goodwill and $1,108 million of other intangible assets related to fiscal 2012 acquisitions which were partially offset by $348 million of foreign currency translation. Other assets increased $3 million from fiscal 2011. Accounts payable increased $154 million from fiscal 2011, primarily due to the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. and shifts in the timing of payments. Long-term debt, including current portion, and notes payable increased $544 million from fiscal 2011 primarily due to the consolidation of Yoplait S.A.S. debt of $376 million and our debt refinancing activities in fiscal 2012. The current and noncurrent portions of net deferred income taxes liability increased $12 million from fiscal 2011. 22 Other current liabilities increased $105 million from fiscal 2011, primarily driven by increases in restructuring and other exit cost reserves and consumer marketing accruals, partially offset by a decrease in accrued taxes. Other liabilities increased $457 million from fiscal 2011, primarily driven by an increase of $426 million in pension, postemployment, and postretirement liabilities. Redeemable interest of $848 million represents the redemption value of Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) 49 percent interest in Yoplait S.A.S. as of May 27, 2012. Please refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Retained earnings increased $767 million from fiscal 2011, reflecting fiscal 2012 net earnings of $1,567 million less dividends paid of $800 million. Treasury stock decreased $33 million from fiscal 2011, due to $346 million related to stock-based compensation plans partially offset by $313 million of share repurchases. Additional paid in capital decreased $11 million from fiscal 2011. Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) increased by $733 million after-tax from fiscal 2011, primarily driven by pension and postemployment activity of $423 million and foreign currency translation of $270 million. Noncontrolling interests increased $214 million in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the addition of Sodiaal 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques S.A.S. Please refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2011 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2011 net sales grew 2 percent to $14,880 million. Net earnings attributable to General Mills were $1,798 million in fiscal 2011, up 18 percent from $1,530 million in fiscal 2010, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.70 in fiscal 2011, up 20 percent from $2.24 in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 results include gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories versus fiscal 2010 which included losses. Fiscal 2011 results also include the net benefit from the resolution of uncertain tax matters, and fiscal 2010 results include income tax expense related to the enactment of federal health care reform. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability was $2.48 in fiscal 2011, up 8 percent from $2.30 in fiscal 2010 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Contributions from volume growth (a) 1 pt Net price realization and mix 1 pt Foreign currency exchange Flat Net sales growth 2 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales grew 2 percent in fiscal 2011, due to 1 percentage point of contribution from volume growth and 1 percentage point of growth from net price realization and mix. Foreign exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2010. Cost of sales increased $91 million in fiscal 2011 to $8,927 million. This was driven by a $157 million increase attributable to higher net input costs and product mix and an $84 million increase attributable to higher volume, partially offset by a $95 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a net increase of $7 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a charge of $48 million resulting from a change in the capitalization threshold for certain equipment parts. 23 Gross margin grew 3 percent in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010. Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased by 40 basis points from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. These improvements were primarily driven by gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2011 versus losses in fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up $29 million in fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010, while SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales remained essentially flat from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a $69 million increase in corporate pension expense partially offset by a 7 percent decrease in advertising and media expense. In fiscal 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar fuerte exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. The $14 million foreign exchange loss resulting from the devaluation was substantially offset by a $13 million recovery against a corporate investment. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a net divestiture gain of $17 million. We recorded a gain of $14 million related to the sale of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our International segment and a gain of $3 million related to the sale of a pie shell product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. There were no divestitures in fiscal 2010. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $4 million in fiscal 2011 as follows: Expense, in Millions Discontinuation of fruit-flavored snack product line $ 1.7 Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 2.7 Total $ 4.4 In fiscal 2011, we decided to exit an underperforming product line in our U.S. Retail segment. As a result of this decision, we concluded that the future cash flows generated by this product line were insufficient to recover the net book value of the associated long-lived assets. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2 million related to the impairment of the associated long-lived assets. No employees were affected by these actions. In addition, we recorded $3 million of charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced. In fiscal 2011, we paid $6 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2011 and previous years. Interest, net for fiscal 2011 totaled $346 million, $55 million lower than fiscal 2010. The average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 5.6 percent in fiscal 2011 compared to 6.3 percent in fiscal 2010, generating a $45 million decrease in net interest. Average interest bearing instruments increased $474 million in fiscal 2011, primarily due to more share repurchases than in fiscal 2010, leading to a $30 million increase in net interest. In fiscal 2010, we also recorded a loss of $40 million related to the repurchase of certain notes, which represented the premium paid, the write-off of remaining discount and unamortized fees, and the settlement of related swaps. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 29.7 percent compared to 35.0 percent in fiscal 2010. The 5.3 percentage point decrease was primarily due to a $100 million reduction to tax expense recorded in fiscal 2011 related to a settlement with the IRS concerning corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008. The adjustments primarily relate to the amount of capital loss, depreciation, and amortization we reported as a result of the sale of noncontrolling interests in our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiary. Fiscal 2010 income tax expense included a $35 million increase related to the enactment of federal health care reform (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010). This legislation changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least the equivalent of benefits under Medicare Part D (see the Impact of Inflation section below for additional discussion of this legislation). After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2011 decreased to $96 million compared to $102 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease is primarily due to higher advertising and media spending and increased service cost allocations, all in CPW. 24 The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Venture Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 CPW 3 % HDJ 4 Joint Ventures 4 % In fiscal 2011, CPW net sales grew by 3 percent due to a 2 percentage point increase in volume and a 1 percentage point increase from favorable foreign exchange. Net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, net sales for HDJ increased 4 percent from fiscal 2010 primarily due to 9 percentage points of favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a 5 percentage point decline in net price realization and mix. Volume was flat compared to fiscal 2010. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 18 million in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010, due primarily to the repurchase of 32 million shares, partially offset by the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Bakeries and Foodservice. The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010: Fiscal Year 2012 2011 2010 In Millions Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Net Sales U.S. Retail $ 10,480.2 63 % $ 10,163.9 69 % $ 10,209.8 70 % International 4,194.3 25 2,875.5 19 2,684.9 18 Bakeries and Foodservice 1,983.4 12 1,840.8 12 1,740.9 12 Total $ 16,657.9 100 % $ 14,880.2 100 % $ 14,635.6 100 % Segment Operating Profit U.S. Retail $ 2,295.3 76 % $ 2,347.9 80 % $ 2,385.2 84 % International 429.6 14 291.4 10 192.1 7 Bakeries and Foodservice 286.7 10 306.3 10 263.2 9 Total $ 3,011.6 100 % $ 2,945.6 100 % $ 2,840.5 100 % Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, gain on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our major 25 product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, ready-to-serve soup, dry dinners, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including granola bars, cereal, and soup. In fiscal 2012, net sales for our U.S. Retail segment were $10.5 billion, up 3 percent from fiscal 2011. Net price realization and mix contributed 9 percentage points of growth, partially offset by a 6 percentage point decrease due to lower pound volume. In fiscal 2011, net sales for this segment totaled $10.2 billion, flat compared to fiscal 2010. Volume on a tonnage basis and net price realization and mix were both flat compared to fiscal 2010.

Meals division net sales were flat. Pillsbury net sales grew 3 percent, led by frozen breakfast items, biscuits, and sweet rolls. Snacks net sales grew 15 percent, driven by Fiber One and Nature Valley snack bars. Net sales for Yoplait declined 5 percent as growth from Go-GURT and Yoplait Greek was offset by volume declines on certain established product lines. Net sales for Baking Products grew 3 percent, driven by flour pricing. Small Planet Food net sales were up 19 percent, led by L rabar natural fruit and nut bars, and Cascadian Farm organic cereals and grain snack bars. In fiscal 2011, net sales for Big G cereals declined 2 percent from fiscal 2010 which included Chocolate Cheerios and Wheaties Fuel introductory volume. Meals division net sales decreased 1 percent as Helper dinner mixes and Green Giant canned vegetables declines were partially offset by growth in Old El Paso Mexican products, Progresso ready-to-serve soups, and Wanchai Ferry and Macaroni Grill frozen entrees. Pillsbury net sales declined 2 percent due to sales declines in Totino pizza. Snacks net sales grew 5 percent, driven by Nature Valley and Fiber One grain snack bars. Net sales for Yoplait grew 1 percent including the acquisition of the Mountain High yogurt business. Net sales for Baking Products declined 4 percent. Small Planet Food net sales were up 13 percent driven by double-digit growth for L rabar natural fruit and nut bars. Segment operating profit of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2012 declined $53 million, or 2 percent, from fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily driven by higher input costs, lower volume, and a 5 percent increase in advertising and media expense. Segment operating profit of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2011 declined $37 million, or 2 percent, from fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable supply chain costs of $81 million, partially offset by a 9 percent reduction in advertising and media expense. INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT Our International segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses outside of the United States. In Canada, our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dry dinners, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, refrigerated yogurt, and grain and fruit snacks. In markets outside North America, our product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, refrigerated yogurt, grain snacks, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, and dry dinners. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located. In fiscal 2012, net sales for our International segment were $4,194 million, up 46 percent from fiscal 2011. This growth was driven by 36 percentage points contributed by the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. Volume contributed 65 percentage points of net sales growth, including 63 percentage points resulting from the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S., and favorable foreign currency exchange contributed 1 percentage point of net sales growth. These gains were partially offset by a decrease of 20 percentage points due to unfavorable net price realization and mix resulting from the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. Net sales totaled $2,876 million in fiscal 2011, up 7 percent from $2,685 million in fiscal 2010. The growth in fiscal 2011 was driven by 6 percentage points of contributions from volume and 1 percentage point from net price realization and mix. Foreign currency exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2010. 27 Components of International Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2012 vs. 2011 Fiscal 2011 vs. 2010 Contributions from volume growth (a) 65 pts 6 pts Net price realization and mix (20)pts 1 pt Foreign currency exchange 1 pt Flat Net sales growth 46 pts 7 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.

In fiscal 2012, net sales in Europe grew 97 percent, including 90 percentage points from the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. The remaining growth was driven by Old El Paso Mexican products and H agen Dazs in France, Green Giant , Nature Valley and Betty Crocker products in the United Kingdom, and favorable foreign currency exchange. In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales grew 21 percent driven by growth from H agen-Dazs products in China, the fiscal 2011 acquisition of Pasta Master in Australia, and favorable foreign currency exchange. Net sales in Canada increased 29 percent primarily due to 27 percentage points of net sales growth from the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. The remaining growth was driven by Cheerios varieties, Old El Paso Mexican products, and favorable foreign currency exchange. Latin America net sales increased 11 percent driven by growth in La Salte a in Argentina and Diablitos in Venezuela, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In fiscal 2011, net sales in Europe increased by 5 percent, driven by growth in H agen Dazs and Nature Valley in the United Kingdom, and Old El Paso Mexican products in France and Switzerland, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales grew 14 percent due to growth from H agen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry brands in China, and atta flour in India. Net sales in Canada increased 8 percent due to favorable foreign currency exchange and growth in ready-to-eat-cereals. Latin America net sales decreased 5 percent due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange primarily related to the 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, partially offset by Diablitos growth in Venezuela and La Salte a growth in Argentina. 28 Segment operating profit for fiscal 2012 grew 47 percent to $430 million from $291 million in fiscal 2011, primarily driven by the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S., higher volume, and favorable foreign currency effects. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2011 grew 52 percent to $291 million, from $192 million in fiscal 2010, primarily driven by volume growth and favorable foreign currency exchange. In fiscal 2010, we incurred a $14 million foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of non-bolivar fuerte monetary balances in Venezuela. In January 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar fuerte by resetting the official exchange rate. The effect of the devaluation was a $14 million foreign exchange loss in fiscal 2010, primarily on the revaluation of non- bolivar fuerte monetary balances in Venezuela. We continue to use the official exchange rate to remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan operations, as we intend to remit dividends solely through the government-operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board (CADIVI). The devaluation of the bolivar fuerte also reduced the U.S. dollar equivalent of our Venezuelan results of operations and financial condition, but this did not have a material impact on our results. During fiscal 2010, Venezuela became a highly inflationary economy, which did not have a material impact on our results in fiscal 2012, 2011, or 2010. BAKERIES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT In our Bakeries and Foodservice segment our major product categories are cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries. For fiscal 2012, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 8 percent to $1,983 million. The increase in fiscal 2012 was driven by an increase in net price realization and mix of 7 percentage points and 1 percentage point contributed by volume growth. For fiscal 2011, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 6 percent to $1,841 million. The increase in fiscal 2011 was driven by an increase in net price realization and mix of 6 percentage points, primarily from prices indexed to commodity markets. Contributions from volume were flat, including a 2 percentage point decline from a divested product line.

The decrease was primarily driven by lower grain merchandising earnings. Segment operating profit was $306 million in fiscal 2011, up from $263 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily driven by net price realization and mix and increased grain merchandising earnings, partially offset by higher input costs. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2012, unallocated corporate expense totaled $348 million compared to $184 million last year. In fiscal 2012 we recorded a $104 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $95 million net decrease in expense last year. In fiscal 2012, we also recorded $11 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. These increases in expense were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefit expense compared to fiscal 2011. Unallocated corporate expense totaled $184 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $203 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, we recorded a $95 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $7 million net increase in expense in fiscal 2010. This was partially offset by a $69 million increase in corporate pension expense in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a $13 million recovery against a corporate investment. IMPACT OF INFLATION We have experienced significant input cost volatility since fiscal 2006. Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of 10 percent input cost inflation, primarily on commodities inputs. We expect the rate of inflation of commodities and energy costs to moderate in fiscal 2013. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through planning and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. 30 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act) was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. Many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies. Because the Act does not take effect fully until future years, the Act did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2012, 2011, or 2010 results of operations. Given the complexity of the Act, the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented, and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance, the full impact of the Act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $6.1 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use this source of liquidity to fund our capital expenditures. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions. As of May 27, 2012, we had $446 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions. There is currently no intent or need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions. If we choose to repatriate cash held in foreign jurisdictions, we will only do so in a tax-neutral manner. Cash Flows from Operations Fiscal Year In Millions 2012 2011 2010 Net earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 1,589.1 $ 1,803.5 $ 1,535.0 Depreciation and amortization 541.5 472.6 457.1 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (88.2 ) (96.4 ) (101.7 ) Stock-based compensation 108.3 105.3 107.3 Deferred income taxes 149.4 205.3 22.3 Tax benefit on exercised options (63.1 ) (106.2 ) (114.0 ) Distributions of earnings from joint ventures 68.0 72.7 88.0 Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (222.2 ) (220.8 ) (17.2 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense (income) 77.8 73.6 (37.9 ) Divestitures (gain) (17.4 ) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (income) 97.8 (1.3 ) 23.4 Changes in current assets and liabilities 243.8 (720.9 ) 143.4 Other, net (100.2 ) (43.2 ) 75.5 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,402.0 $ 1,526.8 $ 2,181.2 In fiscal 2012, our operations generated $2.4 billion of cash compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2011. The $875 million increase primarily reflects changes in current assets and liabilities, including a $384 million increase driven by inventory reduction efforts in fiscal 2012. Prepaid expenses and other current assets accounted for a $245 million increase, primarily reflecting changes in foreign currency hedges and the fair value of open grain contracts. Other current liabilities accounted for a $386 million increase, primarily reflecting changes in accrued income taxes as a result of audit settlements and court decisions in fiscal 2011 and changes in consumer marketing and related accruals. The favorable change in working capital was offset by a $214 million decrease in net earnings. Additionally, fiscal 2012 includes non-cash restructuring charges of $101 million reflecting employee severance expense and the write-off of certain long-lived assets. In both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, we made a $200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans. 31 We strive to grow core working capital at or below our growth in net sales. For fiscal 2012, core working capital decreased 7 percent, compared to net sales growth of 12 percent, primarily reflecting our inventory reduction efforts. In fiscal 2011, core working capital increased 16 percent, compared to net sales growth of 2 percent, and in fiscal 2010, core working capital increased 3 percent, compared to net sales growth of 1 percent. In fiscal 2011, our operations generated $1.5 billion of cash compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2010. The decrease primarily reflects an $864 million increase in use of cash for net current assets and liabilities and a $200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans, partially offset by the $268 million increase in net earnings and a $183 million change in deferred income taxes primarily related to our pension plan contribution and a change in tax legislation related to depreciation deductions. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2012 2011 2010 Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment $ (675.9 ) $ (648.8 ) $ (649.9 ) Acquisitions (1,050.1 ) (123.3 ) Investments in affiliates, net (22.2 ) (1.8 ) (130.7 ) Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings, and equipment 2.2 4.1 7.4 Proceeds from divestiture of product lines 34.4 Exchangeable note (131.6 ) Other, net 6.8 20.3 52.0 Net cash used by investing activities $ (1,870.8 ) $ (715.1 ) $ (721.2 ) In fiscal 2012, cash used by investing activities increased by $1.2 billion from fiscal 2011. The increased use of cash primarily reflects the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. in fiscal 2012 for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion, comprised of $900 million of cash, net of $30 million of cash acquired, and $261 million of non-cash consideration for debt assumed. In addition, we purchased a zero coupon exchangeable note due in 2016 from Sodiaal with a notional amount of $132 million. We invested $676 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2011, cash used by investing activities decreased by $6 million from fiscal 2010. The decreased use of cash reflects $25 million of proceeds from the divestiture of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our International segment and $9 million of proceeds from the sale of a pie shell product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment in fiscal 2011. In addition, in fiscal 2011, we paid $123 million for acquisitions during the year. We also invested $131 million in affiliates in fiscal 2010, mainly our CPW joint venture, to repay local borrowings. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million in fiscal 2013, excluding any expenditures required to support Yoki. These expenditures will support initiatives that are expected to: increase manufacturing capacity for grain snacks and Greek yogurt; fuel International growth and expansion; continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain; and support yogurt capacity initiatives of Yoplait S.A.S. 32 Cash Flows from Financing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2012 2011 2010 Change in notes payable $ 227.9 $ (742.6 ) $ 235.8 Issuance of long-term debt 1,390.5 1,200.0 Payment of long-term debt (1,450.1 ) (7.4 ) (906.9 ) Proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 233.5 410.4 388.8 Tax benefit on exercised options 63.1 106.2 114.0 Purchases of common stock for treasury (313.0 ) (1,163.5 ) (691.8 ) Dividends paid (800.1 ) (729.4 ) (643.7 ) Other, net (13.2 ) (10.3 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (661.4 ) $ (936.6 ) $ (1,503.8 ) Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $275 million in fiscal 2012. In February 2012, we repaid $1.0 billion of 6.0 percent notes. In November 2011, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.15 percent notes due December 15, 2021. The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our notes due February 2012, to reduce our commercial paper borrowings, and for general corporate purposes. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes may be redeemed at our option at any time prior to September 15, 2021 for a specified make whole amount and any time on or after that date at par. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. As part of our acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S., we consolidated $458 million of primarily euro-denominated Euribor-based floating-rate bank debt. In December 2011, we refinanced this debt with $390 million of euro-denominated Euribor-based floating-rate bank debt due at various dates through December 15, 2014. In May 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 1.55 percent fixed-rate notes and $400 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate notes, both due May 16, 2014. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. The floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 35 basis points, subject to quarterly reset. Interest on the floating-rate notes is payable quarterly in arrears. Interest on the fixed-rate notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The fixed-rate notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. In June 2010, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4 percent notes due 2040. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. In May 2010, we paid $437 million to repurchase in a cash tender offer $400 million of our previously issued debt. We repurchased $221 million of our 6.0 percent notes due 2012 and $179 million of our 5.65 percent notes due 2012. We issued commercial paper to fund the repurchase. During fiscal 2012, we had $234 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $410 million in fiscal 2011, a decrease of $177 million. During fiscal 2010, we had $389 million proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased 8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $313 million. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 32 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,164 million. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $692 million. On June 28, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date. 33 Dividends paid in fiscal 2012 totaled $800 million, or $1.22 per share, a 9 percent per share increase from fiscal 2011. Dividends paid in fiscal 2011 totaled $729 million, or $1.12 per share, a 17 percent per share increase from fiscal 2010 dividends of $0.96 per share. On June 26, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.32 per share, an 8 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2012. Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: Fiscal Year Inflow (Outflow), in Millions 2012 2011 2010 Advances to joint ventures, net $ (22.2 ) $ (1.8 ) $ (128.1 ) Dividends received 68.0 72.7 88.0 CAPITAL RESOURCES Total capital consisted of the following: In Millions May 27, 2012 May 29, 2011 Notes payable $ 526.5 $ 311.3 Current portion of long-term debt 741.2 1,031.3 Long-term debt 6,161.9 5,542.5 Total debt 7,429.6 6,885.1 Redeemable interest 847.8 Noncontrolling interests 461.0 246.7 Stockholders equity 6,421.7 6,365.5 Total capital $ 15,160.1 $ 13,497.3 The increase in total capital from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to additional non-controlling interests and the redeemable interest generated as a result of the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S., as well as an increase in long-term debt and notes payable as a result of our debt refinancing activities during fiscal 2012. The following table details the fee-paid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of May 27, 2012: In Billions Amount Credit facility expiring: April 2015 $ 1.0 April 2017 1.7 Total committed credit facilities 2.7 Uncommitted credit facilities 0.4 Total committed and uncommitted credit facilities $ 3.1 To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding short-term borrowings. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $2.7 billion of fee-paid committed credit lines, consisting of a $1.0 billion facility expiring in April 2015 and a $1.7 billion facility 34 expiring in April 2017. We also have $394 million in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations. As of May 27, 2012, there were no amounts outstanding on the fee-paid committed credit lines and $114 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 times. Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 27, 2012, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $741 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 27, 2012, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 71 percent in fixed-rate and 29 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 77 percent in fixed-rate and 23 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 29, 2011. The change in the fixed-rate and floating-rate percentages was driven by the addition of the floating-rate debt consolidated as part of the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. and an increase in notes payable in fiscal 2012. Growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Return on average total capital decreased from 13.8 percent in fiscal 2011 to 12.7 percent in fiscal 2012 primarily reflecting the impact of the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. We also believe that the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2012 was 6.26 compared to 7.03 in fiscal 2011. The measure decreased from fiscal 2011 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased by $218 million and fixed charges increased by $18 million, driven mainly by higher interest and rent expense. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 10.1 percentage points to 32.3 percent in fiscal 2012, primarily driven by an increase of $875 million in cash flows from operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into a purchase agreement with Yoki, a privately held food company headquartered in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Brazil, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1.97 billion Brazilian reals (approximately $990 million as of May 27, 2012) including the assumption of approximately 220 million Brazilian reals (approximately $110 million as of May 27, 2012) of outstanding debt. The purchase price is subject to an adjustment based on the net asset value of the business at the closing date. Yoki operates in several food categories, including snacks, convenient meals, basic foods, and seasonings. We expect the transaction to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2013. We expect to fund this transaction using cash available in our foreign subsidiaries and commercial paper. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait S.A.S. and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques S.A.S. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of the entities. We consolidated both entities into our consolidated financial statements. At the date of the acquisition, we recorded the $264 million fair value of Sodiaal 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques S.A.S. as a noncontrolling interest, and the $904 million fair value of its 49 percent interest in Yoplait S.A.S. as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of 9 years. As of May 27, 2012, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $848 million which approximates its fair value. As of May 27, 2012, we also had a noncontrolling interest related to our subsidiary General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC). We hold all interests in GMC other than Class A Limited Membership Interests (Class A Interests) which were held by an unrelated third-party investor. On June 1, 2012, subsequent to our year end, we restructured GMC through the distribution of its manufacturing assets, stock, inventory, cash and certain intellectual property to a wholly owned subsidiary. GMC retained the remaining intellectual property. Immediately following the restructuring, the Class A Interests were sold by the current holder to another unrelated third-party investor. 35 The third-party holder of the Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate, currently equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 110 basis points, to the holder capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. The holder of the Class A Interests may initiate a liquidation of GMC under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, GMC failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the Class A Interests, GMC failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody or BBB- by Standard & Poor s, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A Interests. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance. The managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the Class A Interests. We may exercise our option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the unrelated third-party investor capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 27, 2012, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $398 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $335 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $338 million as of May 27, 2012. As of May 27, 2012, we had invested in five variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended May 27, 2012. We determined whether or not we were the primary beneficiary (PB) of each VIE using a qualitative assessment that considered the VIE purpose and design, the involvement of each of the interest holders, and the risks and benefits of the VIE. We are the PB of three of the VIEs. We provided minimal financial or other support to our VIEs during fiscal 2012 and there are no arrangements related to VIEs that would require us to provide significant financial support in the future. Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). The PPA revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax-qualified plans. Most of these provisions were applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2011. The PPA may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We made $200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2013. Actual fiscal 2013 contributions could exceed our current projections, and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements. Additionally, our projections concerning timing of the PPA funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, interest rates, and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. 36 The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year In Millions Total 2013 2014 -15 2016 -17 2018 and Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 6,900.5 $ 739.6 $ 2,511.0 $ 999.9 $ 2,650.0 Accrued interest 100.2 100.2 Operating leases (b) 337.7 86.8 124.2 78.1 48.6 Capital leases 3.8 1.8 1.7 0.3 Purchase obligations (c) 2,633.2 2,286.9 168.1 91.8 86.4 Total contractual obligations 9,975.4 3,215.3 2,805.0 1,170.1 2,785.0 Other long-term obligations (d) 2,142.4 Total long-term obligations $ 12,117.8 $ 3,215.3 $ 2,805.0 $ 1,170.1 $ 2,785.0 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $4 million for capital leases or $1 million for net unamortized bond premiums and discounts and fair value adjustments. (b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $56 million as of May 27, 2012, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $19 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $10 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2013. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2013. As of May 27, 2012, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $281 million. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefits. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The media and advertising expenditures are generally recognized as expense when the advertisement airs. The cost of payments to customers and other consumer-related activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded, which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $561 million as of May 27, 2012, and $463 million as of 37 May 29, 2011. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We performed our fiscal 2012 assessment as of November 28, 2011, and determined there was no impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as their related fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Pillsbury , Totino , Progresso , Green Giant , Yoplait , Old El Paso , and H agen-Dazs brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We performed our fiscal 2012 assessment of our brand intangibles as of November 28, 2011. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included: projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands; and a discount rate. As of our assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values. As of May 27, 2012, we had $12.4 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense. In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted average cost of capital or significant business disruptions. The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary. 38 Redeemable Interest On July 1, 2011, we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait S.A.S., a consolidated entity. Sodiaal holds the remaining 49 percent interest in Yoplait S.A.S. Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of 9 years. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest redemption value, which approximates its fair value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we adjusted the redeemable interest redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency rates, and a discount rate. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2012 volatility assumption would increase the grant-date fair value of our fiscal 2012 option awards by 6 percent. Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would change the grant date fair value by 17 percent. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2012 2011 2010 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $ 5.88 $ 4.12 $ 3.20 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 2.9 % 2.9 % 3.7 % Expected term 8.5 years 8.5 years 8.5 years Expected volatility 17.6 % 18.5 % 18.9 % Dividend yield 3.3 % 3.0 % 3.4 % To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data 39 has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years financing cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post-1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. The IRS initiated its audit of our fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 tax years during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2012, we reached a settlement with the IRS concerning research and development tax credits claimed for fiscal years 2002 to 2008. This settlement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. As of the end of fiscal 2012, we have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2008 and prior. During fiscal 2011, we reached a settlement with the IRS concerning certain corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008. The adjustments primarily relate to the amount of capital loss, depreciation, and amortization we reported as a result of the sale of noncontrolling interests in our GMC subsidiary. As a result, we recorded a $108 million reduction in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2011. We made payments totaling $385 million in fiscal 2011 related to this settlement. Also during fiscal 2011, the Superior Court of the State of California issued an adverse decision concerning our state income tax apportionment calculations. As a result, we recorded a $12 million increase in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2011. We believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and have appealed this decision. We do not expect to make a payment related to this matter until it is definitively resolved. 40 Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years. Currently, several state examinations are in progress. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has completed its review of our income tax returns in Canada for fiscal years 2003 to 2005. The CRA has raised assessments for these years to which we have objected or otherwise addressed through the Mutual Agreement procedures of the Canada-US tax treaty. We believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and are vigorously defending our positions. We do not anticipate that any United States or Canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. As of May 27, 2012, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $281 million. We do not expect to pay any amounts related to uncertain tax positions or accrued interest in the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering most employees in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made $200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2013. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. In fiscal 2012, we announced changes to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. All new salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013 will be eligible for a new retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan. Current salaried employees will remain in the existing defined benefit pension plan with adjustments to benefits. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our retirees in the United States and Canada. The salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2012. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act), was signed into law in March 2010. We continue to evaluate the effect of the Act, including its potential impact on the future cost of our benefit plans. Postemployment Benefit Plans Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and the health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. 41 The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is: 25 percent to equities in the United States; 15 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 35 percent to fixed income; and 15 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). For other postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were 1.2 percent, 2.3 percent, 7.7 percent, 8.1 percent, and 9.5 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 27, 2012. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 9.52 percent for fiscal 2012, 9.53 percent for fiscal 2011, and 9.55 percent for fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2012, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 8.6 percent due to generally lower expectations for long-term rates of return across our asset classes due to the recent global economic slowdown and our expectation of an extended time frame for recovery. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $26.5 million for fiscal 2013. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the top quartile of AA-rated corporate bond yields, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Weighted-Average Discount Rates Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Postemployment Benefit Plans Obligations as of May 27, 2012, and fiscal 2013 expense 4.85 % 4.70 % 3.86 % Obligations as of May 29, 2011, and fiscal 2012 expense 5.45 % 5.35 % 4.77 % Fiscal 2011 expense 5.85 % 5.80 % 5.12 % 42 Lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2013 by approximately $41.8 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 8.5 percent for all retirees. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in 2019 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: In Millions One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2013 $ 5.7 $ (4.7 ) Effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 27, 2012 96.7 (85.4 ) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2012, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $106 million compared to $95 million of expense in fiscal 2011 and $11 million of income in fiscal 2010. As of May 27, 2012, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.7 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and $232 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates and declines in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension expense and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. We use the 2012 IRS Static Mortality Table projected forward to our plans measurement dates to calculate the year-end defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act), was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 with many provisions in the Act requiring the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies. Estimates of the future impacts of several of the Act provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability including the elimination of lifetime maximums and the imposition of an excise tax on high cost health plans. These changes resulted in a $24 million increase in our 43 postretirement benefit liability in fiscal 2010. Given the complexity of the Act, the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented, and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance, further financial impacts to our postretirement benefit liability and related future expense may occur. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance for the presentation of other comprehensive income (OCI). This guidance requires entities to present net income and OCI in either a single continuous statement or in separate consecutive statements. The guidance does not change the components of net income or OCI, when OCI should be reclassified to net income, or the EPS calculation. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2013. This guidance will not impact our results of operations or financial position. In December 2011, the FASB issued new accounting disclosure requirements about the nature and exposure of offsetting arrangements related to financial and derivative instruments. The requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2013, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The requirements will not impact our results of operations or financial position. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. Management and the Board of Directors believe that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. Total Segment Operating Profit This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. A reconciliation of this measure to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Diluted EPS Excluding Certain Items Affecting Comparability This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management judgment, significantly affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results. 44 The reconciliation of diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability to diluted EPS, the relevant GAAP measure, follows: XXX,XX XXX,XX XXX,XX XXX,XX XXX,XX Fiscal Year Per Share Data 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 2.35 $ 2.70 $ 2.24 $ 1.90 $ 1.85 Mark-to-market effects (a) 0.10 (0.09 ) 0.01 0.11 (0.05 ) Divestitures gain, net (b) (0.06 ) Gain from insurance settlement (c) (0.04 ) Uncertain tax items (d) (0.13 ) 0.08 (0.04 ) Tax charge - health care reform (e) 0.05 Acquisition integration costs (f) 0.01 Restructuring costs (g) 0.10 Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items affecting comparability $ 2.56 $ 2.48 $ 2.30 $ 1.99 $ 1.76 (a) Net (gain) loss from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories.

Net Sales Growth Rates for Our International Segment Excluding the Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure of our International segment and region net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance in markets outside the United States by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign exchange markets. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. 46 Fiscal 2012 Percentage Change in Net Sales as Reported Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Percentage Change in Net Sales on Constant Currency Basis Europe 97 % (1 ) pt 98 % Asia/Pacific 21 4 17 Canada 29 1 28 Latin America 11 (3 ) 14 Total International 46 % 1 pt 45 % Fiscal 2011 Percentage Change in Net Sales as Reported Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Percentage Change in Net Sales on Constant Currency Basis Europe 5 % (2 ) pts 7 % Asia/Pacific 14 5 9 Canada 8 5 3 Latin America (5 ) (16 ) 11 Total International 7 % Flat 7 % CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on our current expectations and assumptions.
