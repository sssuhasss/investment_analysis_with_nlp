Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. This management discussion and analysis is intended to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from th e results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in this report, including under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview DISH Network added approximately 33,000 net new subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 422,000 net new subscribers during the same period in 2009. This decrease primarily resulted from increased churn. Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 1.76%, compared to 1.64% for the same period in 2009. Churn increased during the year as a result of the increasingly competitive nature of our industry, the current economic conditions, multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers during the fourth quarter of 2010, and our 2010 price increases. In general, our churn rate is impacted by the quality of subscribers acquired in past quarters, our ability to provide strong customer service, and our ability to control piracy. Historically, we have experienced slightly higher churn in the months following the expiration of commitments for new subscribers. In February 2008, we extended our new subscriber commitment from 18 to 24 months. Consequently, during the second half of 2009, churn was positively impacted by, among other things, this increase in our new subscriber commitment period. During the year ended December 31, 2010, DISH Network added approximately 3.052 million gross new subscribers compared to approximately 3.118 million gross new subscribers during the same period in 2009, a decrease of 2.1%. Our gross activations in 2010 were negatively impacted relative to 2009 by increased competitive pressures, including the aggressive marketing and the effectiveness of certain competitors promotional offers, which included an increased level of discounts. Programming costs continue to represent an increasing percentage of our Subscriber-related expenses. Going forward, our margins may face further pressure if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts on favorable pricing and other economic terms. Additionally, our gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long-term programming contracts before they expire. During the fourth quarter of 2010, our gross subscriber activations and subscriber churn were negatively impacted as a result of multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers. As the pay-TV industry matures, we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers of pay-TV services. Some of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers. Furthermore, although we seek to remain the low cost provider in the pay-TV industry in the U.S., our price increases during 2010 along with our inability to effectively market our low cost position contributed to increased churn. In addition, programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved. Significant changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which they obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could mate rially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. While economic factors have impacted the entire pay-TV industry, our relative performance has also been driven by issues specific to DISH Network. In the past, our subscriber growth has been adversely affected by signal theft and other forms of fraud and by operational inefficiencies at DISH Network. To combat signal theft and improve the security of our broadcast system, we completed the replacement of our security access devices to re-secure our system during 2009. We expect that additional future replacements of these 42 Table of Contents devices will be necessary to keep our system secure. To combat other forms of fraud, we continue to monitor our third party distributors to ensure adherence to our business rules. While we have made improvements in responding to and dealing with customer service issues, we continue to focus on the prevention of these issues, which is critical to our business, financial position and results of operations. To address our operational inefficiencies, we continue to focus on simplifying and standardizing our operations. For example, we have streamlined our hardware offerings and continue to make significant investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives, primarily in our call center and in-home service operations. These investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business, improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, increase productivity and allow us to scale better over the long run. We cannot, however, be certain that our increased spending will ultimately be successful in yielding such returns. We have been investing more in advanced technology equipment as part of our subscriber acquisition and retention efforts. Initiatives to transmit certain programming only in MPEG-4 and to activate most new subscribers only with MPEG-4 receivers have accelerated our deployment of MPEG-4 receivers. To meet current demand, we have increased the rate at which we upgrade existing subscribers to HD and DVR receivers. While these efforts may increase our subscriber acquisition and retention costs, we believe that they will help mitigate subscriber churn in the future and reduce costs over the long run. We are also continuing to change equipment for certain subscribers to make more efficient use of transponder capacity in support of HD and other initiatives. We expect to continue these initiatives through 2011. We believe that the benefit from the increase in available transponder capacity outweighs the short-term cost of these equipment changes. To maintain and enhance our competitiveness over the long term, we are promoting a suite of integrated products designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching TV anytime and anywhere, referred to as TV Everywhere. TV Everywhere utilizes, among other things, online access and Slingbox placeshifting technology. There can be no assurance that these integrated products will positively affect our results of operations or our gross new subscriber additions. Liquidity Drivers Like many companies, we make general investments in property such as satellites, information technology and facilities that support our overall business. As a subscriber-based company, however, we also make subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. While the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short-term, the subscriber-specific investments are less discretionary. Our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment. Once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber, the subsequent cash flow is generally positive. There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time. The first factor is how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers. As we lose subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced. The second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our subscriber-related margins. To the extent our Subscriber-related expenses grow faster than our Subscriber-related revenue, the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced. The third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers. The faster we acquire new subscribers, the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with new subscribers. Finally, our future cash flow is impacted by the rate at which we mak e general investments and any cash flow from financing activities. Our subscriber-specific investments to acquire new subscribers have a significant impact on our cash flow. While fewer subscribers might translate into lower ongoing cash flow in the long-term, cash flow is actually aided, in the short-term, by the reduction in subscriber-specific investment spending. As a result, a slow down in our business due to external or internal factors does not introduce the same level of short-term liquidity risk as it might in other industries. 43 Table of Contents Availability of Credit and Effect on Liquidity The ability to raise capital has generally existed for DISH Network despite the weak economic conditions. Because of the cash flow of our company and the absence of any material debt payments until October 2011, modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not impact our current operational plans. Currently, we have no existing lines of credit, nor have we historically. Future Liquidity Our Subscriber-related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber-related revenue was 53.2% during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 55.1% during the same period in 2009. ARPU was positively impacted by price increases in February and June 2010. Subscriber-related expenses continued to be negatively impacted by increased programming costs and initiatives to improve customer service. We continue to focus on addressing operational inefficiencies specific to DISH Network, which we believe will contribute to long-term subscriber growth. If we are unsuccessful in overturning the District Court ruling on Tivo motion for contempt, we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with Tivo on reasonable terms, we may be required to eliminate DVR functionality in all but approximately 192,000 digital set-top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set-top boxes with DVR functionality. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality, which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers. Furthermore, the inability to offer DVR functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of DISH Network services. The adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the District Court contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant. Additionally, the supplemental damage award of $103 million and further award of approximately $200 million does not include damages, contempt sanctions or interest for the period after June 2009. In the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal, we could also have to pay substantial additional damages, contempt sanctions and interest. Depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement, we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital. Therefore, any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us, which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives. 160; We believe the cost of such capital and its terms and conditions may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings. If we are successful in overturning the District Court ruling on Tivo motion for contempt, but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes Tivo patent, we could be prohibited from distributing DVRs or could be required to modify or eliminate our then-current DVR functionality in some or all set-top boxes in the field. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material. We could also have to pay substantial additional damages. Because both we and EchoStar are defendants in the Tivo lawsuit, we and EchoStar are jointly and severally liable to Tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the District Court. We have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-off to indemnify EchoStar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit. EchoStar contributed an amount equal to its $5 million intellectual property liability limit under the Receiver Agreement. We and EchoStar have further agreed that EchoStar $5 million contribution would not exhaust EchoStar liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the Receiver Agreement. We and EchoStar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of, and a cross-license to use, any intellectual property developed in connection with any pote ntial new alternative technology. If Voom prevails in its breach of contract suit against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages, which would have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. In January 2008, Voom HD Holdings ( Voom ) filed a lawsuit against us in New York Supreme Court, alleging breach of contract and other 44 Table of Contents claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain Voom HD channels on the DISH Network satellite TV service. At that time, Voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement. The Court denied Voom request, finding, among other things, that Voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits. In April 2010, we and Voom each filed motions for summary judgment. Voom later filed two motions seeking discovery sanctions. On November 9, 2010, the Court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment, but granting Voom motions for discovery sanctions. The Court decision provides for an adverse inference jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial. We appealed the grant of Voom motion for disc overy sanctions to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department. On February 15, 2011, the appellate Court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal. Voom is claiming over $2.5 billion in damages. We entered into an $87.5 million Credit Facility with DBSD North America on February 1, 2011. The Credit Facility remains subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, on February 1, 2011 we committed to acquire 100% of the equity of reorganized DBSD North America for approximately $1.0 billion subject to certain adjustments, including interest accruing on DBSD North America existing debt. This transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval by the FCC and DBSD North America emergence from bankruptcy. See Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. The Spin-off. On January 1, 2008, we completed the distribution of our technology and set-top box business and certain infrastructure assets (the Spin-off ) into a separate publicly-traded company, EchoStar. DISH Network and EchoStar operate as separate publicly-traded companies, and neither entity has any ownership interest in the other. However, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of both companies is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer or by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS Subscriber-related revenue . Subscriber-related revenue consists principally of revenue from basic, premium movie, local, HD programming, pay-per-view, Latino and international subscription television services, equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees, including fees for DVRs, equipment upgrade fees and additional outlet fees from subscribers with multiple receivers, advertising services, fees earned from our in-home service operations and other subscriber revenue. Certain of the amounts included in Subscriber-related revenue are not recurring on a monthly basis. Equipment sales and other revenue . Equipment sales and other revenue principally includes the non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other third-party distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. Equipment sales, services and other revenue EchoStar. Equipment sales, services and other revenue EchoStar includes revenue related to equipment sales, professional services, and other agreements with EchoStar. Subscriber-related expenses . Subscriber-related expenses principally include programming expenses, costs incurred in connection with our in-home service and call center operations, billing costs, refurbishment and repair costs related to receiver systems, subscriber retention and other variable subscriber expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses EchoStar . Satellite and transmission expenses EchoStar includes the cost of leasing satellite and transponder capacity from EchoStar and the cost of digital broadcast operations provided to us by EchoStar, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, signal processing, conditional access management, telemetry, tracking and control, and other professional services. Satellite and transmission expenses other . Satellite and transmission expenses other includes executory costs associated with capital leases and costs associated with transponder leases and other related services. Equipment, services and other cost of sales. Equipment, services and other cost of sales principally includes the cost of non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other third-party distributors of our equipment 45 Table of Contents domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. In addition, this category includes costs related to equipment sales, professional services, and other agreements with EchoStar. Subscriber acquisition costs . In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of our receiver systems to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of our receiver systems sold to retailers and other third-party distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems sold directly by us to subscribers, including net costs related to our promotional incentives, costs related to our direct sales efforts and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising. We exclude the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new su bscribers from Subscriber acquisition costs. SAC. Subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation, or SAC, and we believe presentations of SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. Our SAC is calculated as Subscriber acquisition costs, plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, divided by gross new subscriber additions. We include all the costs of acquiring subscribers (e.g., subsidized and capitalized equipment) as our management believes it is a more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire subscribers. We also include all new DISH Network subscribers in our calculation, including DISH Network subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs. General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, accounting and finance, including non-cash, stock-based compensation expense. It also includes outside professional fees (e.g., legal, information systems and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized primarily includes interest expense, prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated debt securities (net of capitalized interest), and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations. Other, net. The main components of Other, net are gains and losses realized on the sale of investments, impairment of marketable and non-marketable investment securities, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable and non-marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair value, and equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ). EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders plus Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized net of Interest income, Taxes and Depreciation and amortization. This non-GAAP measure is reconciled to Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders in our discussion of Results of Operations below. DISH Network subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, third-party retailers and other third-party distribution relationships in our DISH Network subscriber count. We also provide DISH Network service to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately equal to the retail price of our America Top 120 programming package (but taking into account, periodically, price changes and other factors), and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH Network subscriber count. Average monthly revenue per subscriber ( ARPU ) . We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, by dividing average monthly Subscriber-related revenue for the period (total Subscriber-related revenue during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by our average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average DISH Network subscribers are calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and 46 Table of Contents dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Average monthly subscriber churn rate. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average DISH Network subscribers for the same period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. When calculating subscriber churn, the same methodology for calculating average DISH Network subscribers is used as when calculating ARPU. Free cash flow . We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 47 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 14.133 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 14.100 million subscribers at December 31, 2009, an increase of 0.2%. During the year ended December 31, 2010, DISH Network added approximately 3.052 million gross new subscribers compared to approximately 3.118 million gross new subscribers during the same period in 2009, a decrease of 2.1%. Our gross activations in 2010 were negatively impacted relative to 2009 by increased competitive pressures, including the aggressive marketing and the effectiveness of certain competitors promotional offers, which included an increased level of discounts. DISH Network added approxima tely 33,000 net new subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 422,000 net new subscribers during the same period in 2009. This decrease primarily resulted from increased churn. Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 1.76%, compared to 1.64% for the same period in 2009. Churn increased during the year as a result of the increasingly competitive nature of our industry, the current economic conditions, multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers during the fourth quarter of 2010, and our 2010 price increases. In general, our churn rate is impacted by the quality of subscribers acquired in past quarters, our ability to provide strong customer service, and our ability to control piracy. Historically, we have experienced slightly higher churn in the months following the expiration of commitments for new subscribers. In February 2008, we extended our new subscriber commitment from 18 to 24 months. Consequently, during the second half of 2009, churn was positi vely impacted by, among other things, this increase in our new subscriber commitment period. When the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. We have not always met our own standards for performing high-quality installations, effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise, answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe, effectively communicating with our subscriber base, reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business, improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment, and aligning the interests of certain third party retailers and installers to provide high-quality service. Most of these factors have affected both gross new subscriber additions as well as existing subscriber churn. Our future gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by these factors, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue growth. Subscriber-related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber-related revenue totaled $12.544 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.005 billion or 8.7% compared to the same period in 2009. This change was primarily related to the increase in ARPU discussed below as well as a larger average subscriber base during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. ARPU . Average monthly revenue per subscriber was $73.32 during the year ended December 31, 2010 versus $70.04 during the same period in 2009. The $3.28 or 4.7% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February and June 2010 and changes in the sales mix toward more advanced hardware offerings. ARPU increased as a result of higher hardware related fees which include rental fees, fees earned from our in-home service operations, and fees for DVRs. This increase was partially offset by increases in the amount of promotional discounts on programming offered to our new subscribers. Equipment sales and other revenue . Equipment sales and other revenue totaled $60 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $38 million or 38.9% compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease in Equipment sales and other revenue primarily resulted from a decline in the sales of non-subsidized DBS receivers and accessories, and digital converter boxes in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Subscriber-related expenses. Subscriber-related expenses totaled $6.676 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $317 million or 5.0% compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in Subscriber-related expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming costs. The increase in programming costs was driven by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts, including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates and by a larger average subscriber base. This increase was partially offset by reduced costs related to our call centers, customer retention, and in-home service operations. We continue to address our operational inefficiencies by streamlining our hardware offerings and making significant investments in staffi ng, training, information systems and other initiatives, primarily in our call centers and in-home service operations. Subscriber-related expenses 49 Table of Contents represented 53.2% and 55.1% of Subscriber-related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The improvement in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from an increase in Subscriber-related revenue and the reduced costs discussed above, partially offset by higher programming costs. In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In addition, our Subscriber-related expenses may face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long-term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. Satellite and transmission expenses EchoStar. Satellite and transmission expenses EchoStar totaled $418 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $99 million or 30.8% compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in Satellite and transmission expenses EchoStar is related to an increase in transponder capacity leased from EchoStar primarily related to the Nimiq 5 satellite, which was placed into service in October 2009, an increase in monthly lease rates per transponder on certain satellites based on the terms of our amended lease agreements and the increase in uplink services. The increase in uplink services was primarily attributable to the launch of additional local channels and increased costs related to additional satellites being placed into service. See Note 17 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Satellite and transmission expenses EchoStar as a percentage of Subscriber-related revenue increased to 3.3% in 2010 from 2.8% in 2009 primarily as a result of the increase in expenses discussed above. Equipment, services and other cost of sales. Equipment, services and other cost of sales totaled $76 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $45 million or 37.0% compared to the same period in 2009. This decrease in Equipment, services and other cost of sales primarily resulted from a decline in the sales of non-subsidized DBS receivers and accessories and in sales of digital converter boxes, and lower charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.653 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $114 million or 7.4% compared to the same period in 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to higher SAC discussed below, partially offset by the decline in gross new subscriber additions. SAC. SAC was $776 during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $697 during the same period in 2009, an increase of $79 or 11.3%. This increase was primarily attributable to increased advertising and hardware costs per activation. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $716 million and $634 million, respectively. This increase in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from an increase in hardware costs per activation, which was driven by an increase in the deployment of more advanced set-top boxes, such as HD receivers and HD DVRs, and a decrease in the redeployment of remanufactured receivers. The increase in the deployment of more advanced set-top boxes was partially driven by our HD Free for Life promotion, which began during June 2010. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers were partially mitigated by the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Our SAC calculation does not reflect any benefit from payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale or used in our existing customer lease program rather than being redeployed through our new lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, these amounts totaled $108 million and $94 million, respectively. We have been deploying receivers that utilize 8PSK modulation technology and receivers that utilize MPEG-4 compression technology for several years. These technologies, when fully deployed, will allow more programming 50 Table of Contents channels to be carried over our existing satellites. A majority of our customers today, however, do not have receivers that use MPEG-4 compression and a smaller but still significant percentage do not have receivers that use 8PSK modulation. We may choose to invest significant capital to accelerate the conversion of customers to MPEG-4 and/or 8PSK to realize the bandwidth benefits sooner. In addition, given that all of our HD content is broadcast in MPEG-4, any growth in HD penetration will naturally accelerate our transition to these newer technologies and may increase our subscriber acquisition and retention costs. All new receivers that we have purchased from EchoStar since 2009 utilize MPEG-4 technology. Although we continue to refurbish and redeploy MPEG-2 receivers, as a result of our HD initiatives and current promotions, we currently activate most new customers with higher priced MPEG-4 technology. This limits our ability to redeploy MPEG-2 receivers and, to the extent that our promotions are successful, will accelerate the transition to MPEG-4 technology, resulting in an adverse effect on our SAC. Our Subscriber acquisition costs and SAC may materially increase in the future to the extent that we transition to newer technologies, introduce more aggressive promotions, or provide greater equipment subsidies. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs. Litigation expense. Litigation expense totaled $225 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, a $136 million or 37.6% decrease compared to the same period in 2009. Litigation expense during 2009 included expense related to the Tivo litigation for the period from April 2008 to June 2009 for supplemental damages, contempt sanctions and interest expense. See Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $984 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, a $44 million or 4.7% increase compared to the same period in 2009. The change in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in depreciation on satellites, as a result of EchoStar XIV and EchoStar XV being placed into service and on equipment leased to subscribers. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized totaled $455 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $66 million or 17.1% compared to the same period in 2009. This change primarily resulted from an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt during the second half of 2009. Other, net. Other, net income totaled $31 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $47 million compared to the same period in 2009. This increase primarily resulted from lower impairment charges on marketable and other investment securities of $28 million and higher realized and unrealized gains of marketable and other investment securities in 2010 compared to 2009. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization . EBITDA was $2.956 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $644 million or 27.9% compared to the same period in 2009. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements. For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,955,786 $ 2,311,398 Interest expense, net (429,619 ) (358,391 ) Income tax (provision) benefit, net (557,473 ) (377,429 ) Depreciation and amortization (983,965 ) (940,033 ) Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders $ 984,729 $ 635,545 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay-TV industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 51 Table of Contents Income tax (provision) benefit, net. Our income tax provision was $557 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $180 million compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in the provision was primarily related to the increase in Income (loss) before income taxes. Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders. Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders was $985 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $349 million compared to $636 million for the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above. 52 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 14.100 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 13.678 million subscribers at December 31, 2008, an increase of 3.1%. DISH Network added approximately 3.118 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to approximately 2.966 million during the same period in 2008, an increase of 5.1%. DISH Network added approximately 422,000 net new subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to a loss of approximately 102,000 net new subscribers during the same period in 2008 as a result of higher gross subscriber additions and reduced churn. Our increased gross subscriber additions were primarily a result of our sales and marketing promotions during the last half of 2009. Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 1.64%, compared to 1.86% for the same period in 2008. Churn was positively impacted by, among other things, the completion of our security access device replacement program, an increase in our new subscriber commitment period and initiatives to retain subscribers. Historically, we have experienced slightly higher churn in the months following the expiration of commitments for new subscribers. In Febr uary 2008, we extended the required new subscriber commitment from 18 to 24 months. During the last half of 2009, due to the change in promotional mix, we had fewer expiring new subscriber commitments. Subscriber-related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber-related revenue totaled $11.539 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $83 million or 0.7% compared to the same period in 2008. This change was primarily related to the increase in ARPU discussed below, partially offset by the decline in our subscriber base from second quarter 2008 through first quarter 2009. ARPU . Average monthly revenue per subscriber was $70.04 during the year ended December 31, 2009 versus $69.27 during the same period in 2008. The $0.77 or 1.1% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2009 and 2008 on some of our most popular programming packages and changes in the sales mix toward HD programming packages and advanced hardware offerings. As a result of our promotions, which provided an incentive for advanced hardware offerings, we continued to see increased hardware related fees, which included fees earned from our in-home service operations, rental fees and fees for DVRs. These increases were partially offset by increases in the amount of promotiona l discounts on programming offered to our new subscribers and retention initiatives offered to existing subscribers, and by decreases in premium movie revenue and pay-per-view buys. Equipment sales and other revenue . Equipment sales and other revenue totaled $98 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $26 million or 21.2% compared to the same period during 2008. The decrease in Equipment sales and other revenue primarily resulted from a decrease in sales of non-subsidized DBS accessories. Subscriber-related expenses. Subscriber-related expenses totaled $6.359 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $382 million or 6.4% compared to the same period 2008. The increase in Subscriber-related expenses was primarily attributable to higher costs for programming content and call center operations. The increase in programming content costs was primarily related to price increases in certain of our programming contracts and the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates. The increases related to call center operations were driven in part by our investments in staffing, training, information systems, and other initiatives. Subscriber-related expenses represented 55.1% and 52.2% of Subscriber-related revenue 8; during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses - EchoStar . Satellite and transmission expenses - EchoStar totaled $320 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $14 million or 4.7% compared to 2008. The increase in Satellite and transmission expenses EchoStar is primarily related to higher uplink center costs, partially offset by fewer transponders leased during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The higher uplink center costs were primarily associated with an increase in the charges from EchoStar related to infrastructure costs for new ground equipment to support our new satellites and the routine replacement of exis ting uplink equipment. The decline in transponder lease expense primarily relates to a reduction in the number of transponders leased as a result of the launch of an owned satellite. This decrease was partially offset by the increase in expense related to the Nimiq 5 satellite, which was placed in service in October 2009. Satellite and transmission expenses - EchoStar as a percentage of Subscriber-related revenue increased to 2.8% in 2009 from 2.7% in 2008. 54 Table of Contents Equipment, services and other cost of sales. Equipment, services and other cost of sales totaled $121 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $49 million or 28.6% compared to the same period in 2008. This decrease in Equipment, services and other cost of sales primarily resulted from lower non-subsidized sales of DBS accessories, a decline in charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory and a decrease in services provided to EchoStar under our transition services agreement with EchoStar. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.540 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $8 million or 0.5% compared to the same period in 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross new subscribers discussed previously, partially offset by lower SAC discussed below. SAC. SAC was $697 during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $720 during the same period in 2008, a decrease of $23, or 3.2%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a change in sales channel mix and a decrease in hardware costs per activation, partially offset by an increase in advertising costs. The decrease in hardware cost per activation was driven by a reduction in manufacturing costs for new receivers and due to more cost-effective deployment of set-top boxes, requiring less equipment per subscriber. These decreases in hardware costs were partially offset by an increase in deployment of more advanced set-top boxes, such as HD receivers and HD DVRs. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $634 million and $604 million, respectively. This increase in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from the increase in gross new subscribers. Our SAC calculation does not reflect any benefit from payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale or used in our existing customer lease program rather than being redeployed through our new lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, these amounts totaled $94 million and $128 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $603 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $59 million or 10.8% compared to the same period in 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to additional costs to support the DISH Network television service including personnel costs and professional fees. General and administrative expenses represented 5.2% and 4.7% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the ratio of the expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in expenses discussed above. Litigation expense. We recorded $361 million of Litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2009 for supplemental damages, contempt sanctions and interest. See Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $940 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a $60 million or 6.0% decrease compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the declines in depreciation expense related to set-top boxes used in our lease programs and the abandonment of a software development project during 2008 that was designed to support our IT systems. The decrease related to set-top boxes was primarily attributable to capitalization of a higher mix of new advanced equipment in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, which has a longer estimated useful life. In addition, the satellite depreciation expense declined due to the retirements of certa in satellites from commercial service, almost entirely offset by depreciation expense associated with satellites placed in service in 2008. Interest income. Interest income totaled $30 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $21 million or 41.4% compared to the same period in 2008. This decrease principally resulted from lower percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities, partially offset by higher average cash and marketable investment securities balances during the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized totaled $388 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $19 million or 5.0% compared to the same period in 2008. This change primarily resulted from an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt during 2009 and 55 Table of Contents 2008 and the Ciel II capital lease, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with 2008 debt redemptions. Other, net. Other, net expense totaled $16 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $169 million in 2008, a decrease of $153 million. This decrease primarily resulted from $178 million less in impairment charges on marketable and other investment securities, partially offset by $33 million less in net gains on the sale and exchanges of investments in 2009 compared to 2008. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization . EBITDA was $2.311 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $576 million or 20.0% compared to the same period in 2008. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2009 was negatively impacted by the $361 million Litigation expense. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements. For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,311,398 $ 2,887,697 Interest expense, net (358,391 ) (318,661 ) Income tax (provision) benefit, net (377,429 ) (665,859 ) Depreciation and amortization (940,033 ) (1,000,230 ) Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders $ 635,545 $ 902,947 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax (provision) benefit, net. Our income tax provision was $377 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $288 million compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in the provision was primarily related to the decrease in Income (loss) before income taxes and a decrease in our effective tax rate. During the year ended December 31, 2008, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the establishment of an $80 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which are capital in nature. Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders. Net income (loss) attributable to DISH Network common shareholders was $636 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $267 million compared to $903 million for the same period in 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable to the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above. 56 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment Securities We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities totaled $2.940 billion compared to $2.139 billion as of December 31, 2009, an increase of $801 million. This increase in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities was primarily related to cash generated from operations of $2.140 billion, partially offset by capital expenditures of $1.216 billion, including the $103 million assignment from EchoStar of certain rights under a launch contract, and by repurchases of our Class A common stock totaling $107 million. We have investments in various debt and equity instruments including corporate bonds, corporate equity securities, government bonds, and variable rate demand notes ( VRDNs ). VRDNs are long-term floating rate municipal bonds with embedded put options that allow the bondholder to sell the security at par plus accrued interest. All of the put options are secured by a pledged liquidity source. Our VRDN portfolio is comprised of investments in many municipalities, which are backed by financial institutions or other highly rated companies that serve as the pledged liquidity source. While they are classified as marketable investment securities, the put option allows VRDNs to be liquidated generally on a same day or on a five business day settlement basis. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held VRDNs, within our current marketable investment securities portfolio, with fa ir values of $1.334 billion and $1.054 billion, respectively. The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non-GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flow from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities and in Purchases of property and equipment as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities and Net cash flows from investing sections, respectively, of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, management timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary signi ficantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment, and other factors. 57 Table of Contents The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Free cash flow $ 923,670 $ 1,157,353 $ 1,058,454 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,216,132 1,037,190 1,129,890 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,139,802 $ 2,194,543 $ 2,188,344 The decrease in free cash flow from 2009 to 2010 of $234 million resulted from a decrease in Net cash flows from operating activities of $55 million or 2.5% and an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $179 million or 17.3%. The decrease in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $605 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $543 million increase in net income, adjusted to exclude non-cash changes in Deferred tax expense (benefit), Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments, and Depreciation and amortization expense. The decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities is principally attributable to the increase in inventory and timing differences between book expense and cash paym ents, primarily related to income taxes and litigation expense. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment in 2010 was primarily attributable to the assignment of certain rights under a launch contract for EchoStar XV and an increase in expenditures for equipment under our lease program for new subscribers. The increase in free cash flow from 2008 to 2009 of $99 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $6 million or 0.3% and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $93 million or 8.2%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $877 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $871 million decrease in net income, adjusted to exclude non-cash changes in Depreciation and amortization expense, Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments, and Deferred tax expense (benefit). The increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to timing differences between book expense and cash payments, including a $361 million increase in the litigation accrual and a $386 million increase in cash flow related to working capital changes and other long-term operating assets. The decrease in Purchases of property and equipment in 2009 was primarily attributable to a decline in expenditures for satellite construction, and equipment under our lease program for existing subscribers, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our lease program for new subscribers. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.140 billion, $2.195 billion, and $2.188 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities, strategic investments and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.478 billion, $2.606 billion and $1.597 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, capital expenditures for new and existing customer equipment totaled $942 million, $876 million and $920 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash outflows from investing activities from 2009 to 2010 of $1.128 billion primarily resulted from a net decrease in purchases of marketable investment securities, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures including the assignment of certain rights under a launch contract from EchoStar. The increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from 2008 to 2009 of $1.008 billion primarily resulted from a net increase in purchases of marketable investment securities, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments and an increase in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments. The overall net increases were partially offset by 58 Table of Contents cash used for purchases of FCC licenses during 2008 and a decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment during 2009 compared to 2008. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long-term debt, cash used for the repurchase, redemption or payment of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, dividends paid on our Class A and Class B common stock and repurchases of our Class A common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $127 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $418 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $1.412 billion. The net cash inflows in 2009 primarily related to the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by our dividend payment of $894 million. The net cash outflows in 2010 primarily related to the repurchases of our Class A common stock. The increase in net cash inflows from 2008 to 2009 primarily resulted from a decrease in the repayment of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, an increase in the net proceeds related to the issuance of long-term debt and a decline in stock repurchases. This increase in net cash inflows was partially offset by the dividend payment of $894 million during 2009. In addition, the 2008 cash outflows were negatively impacted by the distribution to EchoStar related to the Spin-off. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber Churn DISH Network added approximately 33,000 net new subscribers during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 422,000 net new subscribers during the same period in 2009. This decrease primarily resulted from increased churn. Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 1.76%, compared to 1.64% for the same period in 2009. See Results of Operations above for further discussion. There are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at any given point in time, including subscriber churn and how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers. As we lose subscribers from our existing base, the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced. Satellites Operation of our subscription television service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer. Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming, particularly by expanding local HD coverage and offering more HD national channels. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand prog ramming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity. Security Systems Increases in theft of our signal or our competitors signals could, in addition to reducing new subscriber activations, also cause subscriber churn to increase. We use Security Access Devices in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult. It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft. During 2009, we completed the replacement of our Security Access Devices and re-secured our system. We expect additional futu re replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure. We cannot ensure that we will be 59 Table of Contents successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system security is compromised. Stock Repurchases Our Board of Directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of our Class A common stock. On November 2, 2010, our Board of Directors extended the plan and authorized an increase in the maximum dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the plan, such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our outstanding shares of our Class A common stock through and including December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2010, we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion under this plan. The following table provides information regarding repurchases of our Class A common stock. For the Years Ended December 31, Class A Common Stock Repurchases 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Total number of shares repurchased 6,020 1,948 3,137 Dollar value of shares repurchased $ 107,079 $ 18,594 $ 82,733 Subscriber Acquisition and Retention Costs We incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers, including advertising, retailer incentives, equipment, installation, and new customer promotions. While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription, there can be no assurance that we will. We deploy business rules such as minimum credit requirements and we strive to provide outstanding customer service, to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their DISH Network service over longer periods of time. Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period. We incur significant costs to retain our existing customers, mostly by upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers. As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention spending includes the cost of equipment and installation. In certain circumstances, we also offer free programming and/or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a commitment to receive service for a minimum term. A component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move. Our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period. Other We are also vulnerable to fraud, particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers. While we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions, there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud, which could impact our subscriber growth and churn. Sustained economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft and subscriber fraud, which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue. 60 Table of Contents Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2010, future maturities of our long-term debt, capital lease and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter (In thousands) Long-term debt obligations $ 6,227,965 $ 1,006,094 $ 6,444 $ 506,114 $ 1,005,778 $ 756,160 $ 2,947,375 Capital lease obligations 286,971 24,801 21,700 22,630 24,881 27,339 165,620 Interest expense on long-term debt and capital lease obligations 2,443,097 467,758 401,896 399,672 362,274 264,500 546,997 Satellite-related obligations 2,416,671 229,492 242,308 250,749 230,731 230,514 1,232,877 Operating lease obligations 115,533 48,647 31,739 19,232 8,355 3,077 4,483 Purchase obligations 1,917,381 1,022,932 256,998 253,947 240,543 136,701 6,260 Total $ 13,407,618 $ 2,799,724 $ 961,085 $ 1,452,344 $ 1,872,562 $ 1,418,291 $ 4,903,612 The Satellite-related obligations in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 as filed on March 1, 2010 inadvertently excluded the EchoStar XVI ten-year satellite lease commitment, which was agreed to in December 2009, and is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of 2012. The obligations associated with this lease would have increased the previously reported Satellite-related obligations during 2012, 2013, 2014, and thereafter by approximately $18 million, $72 million, $72 million and $553 million, respectively. These amounts are included in the table above. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. The table above does not include $193 million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits which were accrued, as discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010. We do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months. The table above does not include the $87.5 million associated with the Credit Facility we entered into with DBSD North America on February 1, 2011. The Credit Facility remains subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, on February 1, 2011 we committed to acquire 100% of the equity of reorganized DBSD North America for approximately $1.0 billion subject to certain adjustments, including interest accruing on DBSD North America existing debt. This amount is also not included in the table above. This transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval by the FCC and DBSD North America emergence from bankruptcy. See Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. We have semi-annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long-term debt securities, which are included in the table above. See Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details. Other than the Guarantees disclosed in Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we generally do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities. Satellite-Related Obligations Satellites Under Construction. As of December 31, 2010, we have agreed to lease capacity on two satellites from EchoStar that are currently under construction. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite-related obligations. 61 Table of Contents QuetzSat-1 . During 2008, we entered into a ten-year transponder service agreement with EchoStar to lease capacity on QuetzSat-1, a DBS satellite, which is expected to be launched during the second half of 2011. EchoStar XVI. During December 2009, we entered into a ten-year transponder service agreement with EchoStar to lease all of the capacity on EchoStar XVI, a DBS satellite, which is expected to be launched during the second half of 2012. Satellite Insurance We generally do not have commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we use. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in-orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. In the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Purchase Obligations Our 2011 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment, digital broadcast operations, satellite and transponder leases, engineering and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, management control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content. These programming commitments are not included in the Contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. In addition, our margins may face further downward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms. Future Capital Requirements Our 6 3/8% Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of $1.0 billion mature on October 1, 2011. We expect to fund our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations, existing cash and marketable investment securities balances, and cash generated through raising additional capital. The amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies, depending on, among other things, the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The majority of our capital expenditures for 2011 are driven by the costs associated with subscriber premises equipment, included in our firm purchase obligations, as well as capital expenditures for our satell ite-related obligations. These expenditures are necessary to operate and maintain the DISH Network television service. Consequently, we consider them to be non-discretionary. The amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives, including our plans to expand our national HD offerings and other strategic opportunities that may arise from time to time. Our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time, and could increase materially as a result of increased competition, significant satellite failures, or sustained economic weakness. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. If we are unsuccessful in overturning the District Court ruling on Tivo motion for contempt, we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license 62 Table of Contents agreement with Tivo on reasonable terms, we may be required to eliminate DVR functionality in all but approximately 192,000 digital set-top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set-top boxes with DVR functionality. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality, which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers. Furthermore, the inability to offer DVR functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of DISH Network services. The adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the District Court contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant. Additionally, the supplemental damage award of $103 million and further awa rd of approximately $200 million does not include damages, contempt sanctions or interest for the period after June 2009. In the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal, we could also have to pay substantial additional damages, contempt sanctions and interest. Depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement, we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital. Therefore, any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us, which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives. We believe the cost of such capital and its terms and conditions may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings. If we are successful in overturning the District Court ruling on Tivo motion for contempt, but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes Tivo patent, we could be prohibited from distributing DVRs or could be required to modify or eliminate our then-current DVR functionality in some or all set-top boxes in the field. In that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering DVR functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material. We could also have to pay substantial additional damages. Because both we and EchoStar are defendants in the Tivo lawsuit, we and EchoStar are jointly and severally liable to Tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the District Court. We have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-off to indemnify EchoStar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit. EchoStar contributed an amount equal to its $5 million intellectual property liability limit under the Receiver Agreement. We and EchoStar have further agreed that EchoStar $5 million contribution would not exhaust EchoStar liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the Receiver Agreement. We and EchoStar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of, and a cross-license to use, any intellectual property developed in connection with any pote ntial new alternative technology. If Voom prevails in its breach of contract suit against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages, which would have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. In January 2008, Voom HD Holdings ( Voom ) filed a lawsuit against us in New York Supreme Court, alleging breach of contract and other claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain Voom HD channels on the DISH Network satellite TV service. At that time, Voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement. The Court denied Voom request, finding, among other things, that Voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits. In April 2010, we and Voom each filed motions for summary judgment. Voom later filed two motions seeking discovery sanctions. On November 9, 2010, the Court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment, but granting Voom motions for discovery sanctions. The Court decision provides for an adverse inference jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial. We appealed the grant of Voom motion for discovery sanctions to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department. On February 15, 2011, the appellate Court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal. Voom is claiming over $2.5 billion in damages In 2008, we paid $712 million to acquire certain 700 MHz wireless licenses, which were granted to us by the FCC in February 2009. To commercialize these licenses and satisfy FCC build-out requirements, we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others. Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build-out, any such investment or partnership could vary significantly. Part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy FCC build-out requirements. We are currently performing a market test to evaluate different technologies and consumer acceptance. 63 Table of Contents From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that may complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities, improve or sustain our competitive position, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital, assume third party debt or incur other long-term obligations. On February 1, 2011, we entered into a commitment to provide a debtor-in-possession credit facility to DBSD North America and certain of its affiliates, which will consist of a non-revolving, multiple draw term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $87.5 million. On February 1, 2011, we entered into an investment agreement pursuant to which we have committed to acquire 100% of the equity of reorganized DBSD North America for approximately $1.0 billion subject to certain adjustments, including interest accruing on DBSD North America existing debt. This transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval by the FCC and DBSD North America emergence from bankruptcy. See Note 18 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high-yield indebtedness, such as us, to access capital markets at acceptable terms. These developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position. A portion of our investment portfolio is invested in auction rate securities, mortgage backed securities, and strategic investments, and as a result a portion of our portfolio has restricted liquidity. Liquidity in the markets for these investments has been adversely impacted. If the credit ratings of these securities deteriorate or the lack of liquidity in the marketplace continues, we may be required to record impairment charges. Moreover, the sustained uncertainty of domestic and global financial markets has greatly affected the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities. To the extent we require access to funds, we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions, record further impairment charges and fall short of our financing needs. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Capitalized satellite receivers . Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, management judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Changes in estimated useful life may impact Depreciation and amortization on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). For example, if we decreased the estimated useful life of our capitalized subscriber equipment by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $106 million. Accounting for investments in private and publicly-traded securities . We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge in Other, net within Other Income (Expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other-than-temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, mark et conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors 64 Table of Contents could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Fair value of financial instruments . Fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument. Sustained economic weakness has resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments, including Mortgage-Backed Securities ( MBS ) and Auction Rate Securities ( ARS ). For certain of these instruments, there is no or limited observable market data. Fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current ec onomic conditions, liquidity discounts, currency, credit and interest rate risks, loss experience and other factors. These estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and may be a less precise measurement of fair value as compared to financial instruments where observable market data is available. We make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date, credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience. As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument. In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique, including liquidity risks, and estimate of future cash flows, could significantly affect these fair value estimates, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. For example, as of December 31, 2010, we held $169 million of securities that lack obser vable market quotes, and a 10% decrease in our estimated fair value of these securities would result in a decrease of the reported amount by approximately $17 million. Valuation of long-lived assets . We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss will be recorded in a new line item entitled Impairments of indefinite-lived and long-lived assets on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Among other reasons, changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write-down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives . We evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. While our impairment tests in 2010 indicated the fair value of our intangible assets were significantly above their carrying amounts, significant changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write-down of intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which will be recorded in a new line item entitled Impairments of indefinite-lived and long-lived assets, on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. A 10% decrease in the estimated future cash flows or a 10% increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets (while all other assumptions remain unchanged) would not result in these assets being impaired. Income taxes . Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. We periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Any such valuation allowance is recorded in either Income tax (provision) benefit, net on our 65 Table of Contents Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) or Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Stockholders equity (deficit) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our consolidated results of operations. Uncertainty in tax positions . Management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law, regulations, case law, administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position. Changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our Income tax provision (benefit), net, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations. Contingent liabilities . A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period to General and administrative expenses or Litigation expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2009-13 ( ASU 2009-13 ), Revenue Recognition - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. ASU 2009-13 changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple deliverable arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price. This standard is effective January 1, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2009-13 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Seasonality Historically, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year, as is typical in the pay-TV service industry. However, we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. Backlog We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments Our investments and debt are exposed to market risks, discussed below. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Investment Securities As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of $2.940 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.729 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) VRDNs convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less; (c) debt instruments of the United 66 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK - Continued States Government and its agencies; (d) commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and/or (e) instruments with similar risk, duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper and corporate obligations described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. The value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses; however, this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer.ont> Interest Rate Risk A change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio. Based on our December 31, 2010 current non-strategic investment portfolio of $2.729 billion, a hypothetical 10% increase in average interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $14 million in fair value of this portfolio. We normally hold these investments to maturity; however, the hypothetical loss in fair value would be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. Our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended December 31, 2010 of 0.7%. A change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re-invested at different rates as the instruments mature. A hypothetical 10% decrease in average interest rates during 2010 would result in a decrease of approximately $2 million in annual interest income. Strategic Marketable Investment Securities As of December 31, 2010, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $211 million. These investments, which are held for strategic and financial purposes, are concentrated in several companies, are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. In general, the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment ecurities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the underlying business. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately $21 million in the fair value of these investments. Restricted Cash and Marketable Investment Securities and Noncurrent Marketable and Other Investment Securities Restricted Cash and Marketable Investment Securities As of December 31, 2010, we had $144 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in: (a) cash; (b) VRDNs convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less; (c) debt instruments of the United States Government and its agencies; (d) commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and/or (e) instruments with similar risk, duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above. Based on our December 31, 2010 investment portfolio, a hypothetical 10% increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities. Noncurrent Auction Rate and Mortgage Backed Securities As of December 31, 2010, we held investments in auction rate securities ( ARS ) and mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) of $119 million, which are reported at fair value. Events in the credit markets have reduced or eliminated current liquidity for certain of our ARS and MBS investments. As a result, we classify these investments as noncurrent 67 Table of Contents
