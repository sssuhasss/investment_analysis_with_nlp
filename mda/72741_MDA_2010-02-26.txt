Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related combined notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References in this Annual Report to "NU," the Company, "we," "us" and "our" refer to Northeast Utilities and its consolidated subsidiaries. All per share amounts are reported on a fully diluted basis. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of NU. The earnings and earnings per share (EPS) of each business discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a financial measure not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to controlling interest of each business by the weighted average fully diluted NU common shares outstanding for the period. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate earnings results and to provide details of earnings results and guidance by business. We believe that this measurement is useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of ou r businesses. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to our consolidated fully diluted EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. The discussion below also includes non-GAAP financial measures referencing our 2008 earnings and EPS excluding a significant charge resulting from the settlement of litigation. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to more fully compare and explain the 2009, 2008 and 2007 results without including the impact of this settlement. Due to the nature and significance of the litigation settlement charge to Net income, management believes that this non-GAAP presentation is more representative of our performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to reported Net income attributable to controlling interest or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of operating performance. Reconciliations of the above non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated fully diluted EPS and Net income attributable to controlling interest are included under "Financial Condition and Business Analysis-Overview-Consolidated" and "Financial Condition and Business Analysis-Future Outlook" in Management's Discussion and Analysis , herein. Financial Condition and Business Analysis Executive Summary The following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this Annual Report: Results, Strategy and Outlook: We earned $330 million, or $1.91 per share, in 2009, compared with $260.8 million, or $1.67 per share, in 2008. Excluding the after-tax charge of $29.8 million, or $0.19 per share, for the settlement of litigation, we earned $290.6 million, or $1.86 per share, in 2008. The increase in 2009 results was due primarily to a $34.4 million increase in earnings from our regulated distribution and transmission segments. The EPS for 2009 reflected the issuance of approximately 19 million common shares on March 20, 2009. Our regulated companies, which consist of The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO), and Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), earned $323.5 million, or $1.87 per share, in 2009, compared with $289.1 million, or $1.85 per share, in 2008. Earnings at the distribution segments of our regulated companies (which also include Yankee Gas and the generation business of PSNH) totaled $159.2 million in 2009, compared with $150.8 million in 2008. Earnings at the transmission segments of our regulated companies totaled $164.3 million in 2009, compared with $138.3 million in 2008. The increase in distribution segment results was due primarily to lower operating costs as a result of cost management efforts, lower storm costs, distribution rate increases at CL&P and PSNH, higher generation-related earnings and the absence of a $3.5 million after-tax charge recorded in 2008 that related to the refund of the 2004 procurement incentive fee. The higher transmission segment results were due to an increased investment in transmission infrastructure after the completion of major projects in 2008. Our competitive businesses, which are held by NU Enterprises, Inc. (NU Enterprises), earned $15.8 million, or $0.09 per share, in 2009, compared with $13.1 million, or $0.08 per share, in 2008. The after-tax mark-to-market gain on wholesale marketing contracts increased by $2.7 million from $1.1 million in 2008 to $3.8 million in 2009. The 2008 mark-to-market included a net after-tax charge of $3.2 million due to the implementation of fair value measurement accounting guidance. NU parent and other companies recorded net expenses of $9.3 million, or $0.05 per share, in 2009, compared with net expenses of $41.4 million, or $0.26 per share, in 2008. Results for 2008 included the after-tax charge of $29.8 million, or $0.19 per share, associated with the settlement of litigation. We project consolidated 2010 earnings of between $1.80 per share and $2.00 per share, including distribution segment earnings of between $0.95 per share and $1.05 per share, transmission segment earnings of between $0.90 per share and $0.95 per share, competitive business earnings of between zero and $0.05 per share, and net expenses at NU parent and other companies of approximately $0.05 per share. PSNH filed a distribution rate case in June 2009 and CL&P filed a distribution rate case in 27 January 2010. There are uncertainties over the outcomes of these distribution rate cases, both of which are expected to conclude in mid-2010. WMECO intends to file a distribution rate case in mid-2010 with an expected decision by the end of 2010 and a distribution rate case filing for Yankee Gas is also under consideration, neither of which are included in the 2010 projections. We paid common dividends of $162.4 million in 2009, compared with $129.1 million in 2008. The increase is the result of 6.3 percent and 11.8 percent increases that took effect in the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, respectively, and a higher number of shares outstanding in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009. We project that we will achieve a compound average annual EPS growth rate for the five-year period from 2010 to 2014 of between 6 percent and 9 percent, using 2009 EPS of $1.91 as the base level. Regulated company capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $6.4 billion from 2010 through 2014, which would enable our total rate base to grow at a compound average annual growth rate of 9.5 percent from approximately $7 billion at the end of 2009 to $11.1 billion at the end of 2014. This projection assumes the projects we have included in our five-year plan are built according to our schedule and on budget. Significant projects included in the plan are the CL&P and WMECO New England East-West Solutions (NEEWS) project, the PSNH Clean Air Project, the Hydro-Qu bec (HQ) tie line project, and the Yankee Gas Waterbury to Wallingford Pipeline Project. Legal, Regulatory and Other Items: On May 22, 2009, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) granted approval of the structure of a proposed project between NU, NSTAR, a Massachusetts utility company that serves the greater Boston area, and HQ, a large Canadian utility, involving a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line from New Hampshire to Canada (HQ tie line project) to deliver and sell 1,200 megawatts (MW) of low-carbon energy in New England. On June 30, 2009, PSNH filed an application with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) requesting a permanent increase in distribution rates of approximately $51 million on an annualized basis to be effective August 1, 2009, and another $17 million to be effective July 1, 2010. On July 31, 2009, the NHPUC approved a temporary increase in distribution rates of $25.6 million on an annualized basis, effective August 1, 2009. PSNH expects a decision on the permanent distribution rate request in mid-2010. Any differences between allowed temporary rates and permanent rates will be reconciled back to August 1, 2009. On August 12, 2009, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) approved the installation of 6 MW of solar energy generation in WMECO's service territory at an estimated cost of $41 million. The return on equity (ROE) on these assets will be a fully tracking 9 percent. On January 8, 2010, CL&P filed an application with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) to raise distribution rates by $133.4 million to be effective July 1, 2010, and by an additional $44.2 million to be effective July 1, 2011. CL&P proposed that the first year increase would be deferred until January 1, 2011 and that approximately $67 million of cash revenue requirement for the second half of 2010 would be deferred and recovered from CL&P customers between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012. A DPUC decision on this rate application is expected in mid-2010. Liquidity: NU completed a public offering of approximately 19 million common shares on March 20, 2009, resulting in $370.8 million of net proceeds to the Company after offering expenses of $12.5 million. The proceeds were used to fund capital investment programs for our regulated companies and to repay short-term borrowings. We anticipate a single public offering of approximately $300 million in NU common shares in the next five years, which is expected no earlier than 2012. We issued $462 million of debt in 2009 ($312 million at CL&P and $150 million at PSNH), comprised of $400 million in first mortgage bonds at rates of 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent, and $62 million in remarketed pollution control revenue bonds (PCRBs) at a one-year fixed rate of 5.25 percent. We expect to issue an aggregate amount of approximately $145 million of long-term debt in the first half of 2010 ($95 million at WMECO and $50 million at Yankee Gas). We had total outstanding long-term and short-term debt of approximately $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2009, compared with approximately $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2008. The decline reflects a reduction of approximately $520 million in notes payable to banks, partially offset by approximately $400 million in increases to long-term debt. The decline in total debt was due primarily to increased cash flows from operations and the sale by NU of approximately 19 million common shares. Our cash capital expenditures totaled $908.1 million in 2009, compared with $1.3 billion in 2008. The decrease in our cash capital expenditures was primarily the result of lower transmission segment capital expenditures, particularly at CL&P, due to the completion in 2008 of three major transmission projects in southwest Connecticut. We project total capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion in 2010 (including non-cash factors) due to higher expenditures for NEEWS and other regulated company projects. After rate reduction bond (RRB) payments included in financing activities, we had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2009 of $745 million, which represented an increase of approximately $321 million from 2008. The improved cash flows were due 28 primarily to higher transmission revenues at CL&P; approximately $225 million more in cash collected in 2009 compared to 2008 for costs that are tracked and passed on to customers; approximately $100 million less in cash expenditures on fuel, materials and supplies in 2009 (largely due to lower amounts spent for Yankee Gas storage due to lower natural gas prices); and the absence in 2009 of the litigation settlement payment of $49.5 million made in March 2008. We project consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities, net of RRB payments, of approximately $4 billion from 2010 through 2014, ranging from approximately $700 million in 2010 to approximately $1.1 billion in 2014. This projection reflects a cash contribution of approximately $45 million into the Company pension plan in the third quarter of 2010, as well as a potential contribution in 2011 of approximately $200 million. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $27 million as of December 31, 2009, compared with $89.8 million as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, we also had $702.8 million of aggregate borrowing availability on our revolving credit lines, as compared to $157.8 million of availability as of December 31, 2008. This increase in availability was primarily a result of the 2009 equity and debt issuances, higher cash flows provided by operating activities and lower capital expenditures. Our credit facilities in a total nominal amount of $900 million will expire on November 6, 2010. While we expect to renew these facilities before the expiration date, costs associated with the new facilities will likely be higher than those associated with the existing credit facilities due to changes in credit market conditions. Overview Consolidated: We earned $330 million, or $1.91 per share, in 2009, compared with $260.8 million, or $1.67 per share, in 2008 and $246.5 million, or $1.59 per share, in 2007. Excluding the after-tax charge of $29.8 million, or $0.19 per share, for the settlement of litigation, we earned $290.6 million, or $1.86 per share, in 2008. The increase in 2009 results was due primarily to a $34.4 million increase in earnings from our regulated distribution and transmission segments, which includes their shares of the resolution of several routine income tax audits that increased NU earnings in 2009 and 2008 by $13.8 million and $8.9 million, respectively. The EPS for 2009 reflected the issuance of approximately 19 million common shares on March 20, 2009. A summary of our earnings by business, which also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of consolidated non-GAAP earnings and EPS, as well as EPS by business, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated net income attributable to controlling interest and fully diluted EPS, for 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts) Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Net income attributable to controlling interest (GAAP) $ 330.0 $ 1.91 $ 260.8 $ 1.67 $ 246.5 $ 1.59 Regulated companies $ 323.5 $ 1.87 $ 289.1 $ 1.85 $ 228.7 $ 1.47 Competitive businesses 15.8 0.09 13.1 0.08 11.7 0.08 NU parent and other companies (9.3) (0.05) (11.6) (0.07) 6.1 0.04 Non-GAAP earnings 330.0 1.91 290.6 1.86 246.5 1.59 Litigation charge (after-tax) - - (29.8) (0.19) - - Net income attributable to controlling interest (GAAP) $ 330.0 $ 1.91 $ 260.8 $ 1.67 $ 246.5 $ 1.59 Regulated Companies: Our regulated companies operate in two segments: electric transmission and electric and gas distribution, with PSNH generation included in its distribution segment. A summary of regulated company earnings by segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 2007 CL&P Transmission $ 136.8 $ 115.6 $ 66.7 PSNH Transmission 18.0 16.7 10.7 WMECO Transmission 9.5 6.0 5.1 Total Transmission $ 164.3 $ 138.3 $ 82.5 CL&P Distribution $ 74.0 $ 70.0 $ 61.4 PSNH Distribution 47.5 41.4 43.7 WMECO Distribution 16.7 12.3 18.5 Yankee Gas 21.0 27.1 22.6 Total Distribution $ 159.2 $ 150.8 $ 146.2 Net Income - Regulated Companies $ 323.5 $ 289.1 $ 228.7 The higher 2009 and 2008 transmission segment earnings reflect an increased investment in this segment as we continued to build out our transmission infrastructure to meet our customers' and the region's reliability needs. The results primarily reflect the effect of CL&P's investment of approximately $1.6 billion since the beginning of 2005 in the southwest Connecticut transmission projects that were completed in late 2008. Our transmission segment rate base has increased from approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2007 to approximately $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2009. 29 CL&P 2009 distribution segment earnings were $4 million higher than 2008 due primarily to lower operating costs as a result of cost management efforts, lower storm costs, higher distribution revenues resulting from distribution rate increases effective February 1 st in both 2008 and 2009, gains from the NU supplemental benefit trust, and the absence of a $5.8 million pre-tax charge recorded in 2008 that related to the refund of the 2004 procurement incentive fee. Partially offsetting these favorable variances were higher expenses related to uncollectible receivable balances, higher pension costs, increased depreciation as a result of greater plant balances in service and greater income taxes as a result of a higher effective income tax rate. CL&P retail electric sales in 2009 were 3.8 percent lower than 2008. CL&P distribution segment regulatory ROE was 7.3 perce nt in 2009, well below its current authorized level of 9.4 percent, and 7.5 percent in 2008. We expect CL&P regulatory ROE to continue to deteriorate before it improves starting in the second half of 2010 when we anticipate the DPUC will issue a decision on CL&P request to raise its distribution rates effective July 1, 2010. CL&P request includes an authorized regulatory ROE of 10.5 percent. PSNH 2009 distribution segment earnings were $6.1 million higher than 2008. The increase in 2009 is due primarily to higher generation-related earnings, higher revenues attributable to the temporary distribution rate increase effective August 1, 2009, lower carrying costs as a result of significant decreases in energy service regulatory obligations owed to customers, and gains from the NU supplemental benefit trust, all of which were partially offset by higher pension costs, increased depreciation as a result of greater plant balances in service, increased amortization costs, higher property taxes as a result of both a larger taxable base and increased local municipal tax rates, and greater income taxes as a result of a higher effective income tax rate. PSNH retail electric sales in 2009 were 2.2 percent lower than 2008. PSNH distribution segment regulatory ROE was 7.2 percent in 2009 (including generation), which reflects a regulatory ROE for the distribution business of 3.6 percent compared with its current authorized level of 9.67 percent. In 2008, PSNH's distribution segment regulatory ROE was 8.3 percent and the regulatory ROE for the distribution business was 6.3 percent. We expect PSNH regulatory ROE to continue to deteriorate before it improves starting in the second half of 2010 when we anticipate the NHPUC will issue a decision on PSNH permanent distribution rate request. PSNH request includes an authorized regulatory ROE of 10.5 percent for its distribution business. WMECO 2009 distribution segment earnings were $4.4 million higher than 2008 due primarily to lower operating costs as a result of cost management efforts, lower storm costs, gains from the NU supplemental benefit trust, and the absence of a $1.6 million pre-tax charge recorded in 2008 related to a DPU ruling. These positive factors were partially offset by higher property taxes as a result of both a greater asset base and increased local municipal tax rates, increased depreciation as a result of greater plant in service balances, increased amortization, and a 4.8 percent decline in retail electric sales. WMECO distribution segment regulatory ROE was 8.4 percent in 2009 and 7.2 percent in 2008. We expect WMECO distribution segment regulatory ROE will be approximately 6 percent in 2010. Yankee Gas 2009 earnings were $6.1 million lower than 2008 due primarily to higher operating costs including expenses related to uncollectible receivable balances, employee benefits, and depreciation, partially offset by higher revenues attributable to a 6.9 percent increase in firm natural gas sales and the absence of a $5.8 million pre-tax charge recorded in 2008 for refunds of previous gas cost recoveries. Yankee Gas regulatory ROE was 6.6 percent in 2009, due primarily to higher uncollectible expenses, and 8.3 percent in 2008. Yankee Gas' authorized regulatory ROE is 10.1 percent. We expect Yankee Gas regulatory ROE will be approximately 9 percent in 2010 due primarily to results from improved collection efforts of customer receivables and higher distribution revenues. For the distribution segment of our regulated companies, a summary of changes in CL&P, PSNH and WMECO retail electric gigawatt-hour (GWh) sales and Yankee Gas firm natural gas sales for 2009 as compared to 2008 on an actual and weather normalized basis (using a 30-year average) is as follows: Electric Firm Natural Gas CL&P PSNH WMECO Total Yankee Gas Percentage Decrease Weather Normalized Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Decrease Weather Normalized Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Weather Normalized Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Decrease Weather Normalized Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Increase Weather Normalized Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Residential (0.7)% 1.5 % (0.2)% 0.6 % (1.6)% 0.2 % (0.7)% 1.2 % 0.7% (1.8)% Commercial (2.9)% (1.4)% (1.5)% (0.7)% (4.8)% (3.4)% (2.8)% (1.5)% 8.7% 6.3 % Industrial (17.6)% (16.6)% (8.2)% (7.1)% (11.7)% (10.9)% (14.1)% (13.1)% 11.3% 10.7 % Other (2.5)% (2.5)% (3.2)% (3.2)% 12.7 % 12.7 % (1.6)% (1.6)% - - Total (3.8)% (2.1)% (2.2)% (1.4)% (4.8)% (3.4)% (3.5)% (2.1)% 6.9% 5.0 % A summary of our retail electric sales in GWh for CL&P, PSNH and WMECO and firm natural gas sales in million cubic feet for Yankee Gas for 2009 and 2008 is as follows: Electric Firm Natural Gas 2009 2008 Percentage Decrease 2009 2008 Percentage Increase Residential 14,412 14,509 (0.7)% 13,562 13,467 0.7% Commercial 14,474 14,885 (2.8)% 14,063 12,939 8.7% Industrial 4,423 5,149 (14.1)% 14,825 13,311 11.3% Other 336 340 (1.6)% - - - Total 33,645 34,883 (3.5)% 42,450 39,717 6.9% 30 Actual retail electric sales in 2009 were lower than 2008 and were significantly impacted by the weather and economic conditions. The spring and summer months in 2009 were significantly cooler than normal and when compared to 2008, the amount of cooling degree days was approximately 23 percent lower in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts and approximately 22 percent lower in New Hampshire. The negative trend in our sales continues to be most prevalent in the industrial class where many customers have been negatively impacted by the weak economic conditions of our region and nation. We believe the reduction in industrial sales is primarily driven by a reduced number of shifts and days of operations. Commercial sales and residential sales in 2009 were also lower than 2008, although residential sales increased by 1.2 percent over 2008 on a weather-normalized basis. In 2010, we expect the econom ic conditions to continue to affect our customers and on a weather normalized basis, we estimate our retail electric sales, across all three states, will be approximately 1 percent lower than 2009. Recovery of our distribution revenues, however, is not wholly dependent on sales and it varies between customer classes. About two-thirds of CL&P and WMECO distribution revenues and about one-half of PSNH distribution revenues are recovered through charges, such as the customer charge and demand charge, that are not dependent on overall sales volumes. As compared to other customer classes, a greater portion of residential revenues is recovered through volumetric charges. In contrast to residential rates, a much smaller portion of commercial and industrial revenues is recovered through volumetric charges. Distribution rates for certain large businesses are structured so that we recover 100 percent of the distribution revenues through non-volumetric charges. In this regard, rate design has significantly mitigated the impact of the declining commercial and industrial sales on distribution revenues and earnings. Actual and weather normalized firm natural gas sales in 2009 were higher than 2008. The 2009 results have improved due to an increase in customers and, for the commercial and industrial sectors, have benefited substantially from the addition of new gas-fired distributed generation in Yankee Gas' service region during the last fifteen to eighteen months ended December 31, 2009. Yankee Gas recovers almost half of its total distribution revenues through non-usage charges, and thus, similar to our electric distribution companies, changes in sales have less of an impact on revenues. In 2010, we estimate our total weather normalized firm natural gas sales will be essentially the same as 2009, but the change will vary for each customer class. Our expense related to uncollectible receivable balances (our uncollectibles expense) is influenced by the economic conditions of our region and the weak conditions in the Northeast continue to have a negative effect on our customers. Fluctuations in our uncollectibles expense are mitigated, however, from an earnings perspective because a portion of the total uncollectibles expense for each of the electric distribution companies is allocated to the respective company energy supply rate and recovered through its tariffs. Additionally, for CL&P and Yankee Gas, write-offs of uncollectible receivable balances attributable to qualified customers under financial or medical duress (or hardship customers) are fully recovered through their respective tariffs. In 2009, our total uncollectibles expense was approximately $21 million higher than 2008 and approximately $19 million of the increase impacted our 2009 earnings. The majo rity of the $19 million increase was incurred by Yankee Gas and CL&P. In 2010, we expect the uncollectibles expense that impacts earnings to be approximately $12 million lower than it was in 2009 and approximately $10 million of the $12 million improvement is expected to be recognized by Yankee Gas. The anticipated decrease in 2010 uncollectibles expense is based on continued account receivable collection efforts, a small decline in overall Yankee Gas revenues as a result of lower natural gas prices, and an expectation that the economic conditions will begin to improve. Competitive Businesses: NU Enterprises, which continues to manage to completion Select Energy, Inc.'s (Select Energy) remaining wholesale marketing contracts and to manage its electrical contracting business, earned $15.8 million, or $0.09 per share, in 2009, compared with $13.1 million, or $0.08 per share, in 2008 and $11.7 million, or $0.08 per share, in 2007. Competitive business earnings in 2009 included an after-tax mark-to-market gain of $3.8 million associated with Select Energy wholesale marketing contracts, as compared to a $1.1 million after-tax mark-to-market gain in 2008 and a $3.8 million after-tax mark-to-market loss in 2007. The mark-to-market gain in 2008 included a net after-tax charge to Net income of $3.2 million associated with the implementation of accounting guidance for fair value measurements. Results for NU Enterprises are not expected to continue at the earnings levels of the past three years, as the margins Select Energy earns on its remaining contracts are expected to decline in future years. We project that NU Enterprises will earn between zero and $0.05 per share in 2010. NU Parent and Other Companies: NU parent and other companies recorded net expenses of $9.3 million, or $0.05 per share, in 2009, compared with net expenses of $41.4 million, or $0.26 per share, in 2008 and net income of $6.1 million, or $0.04 per share, in 2007. The net expenses in 2008 included a $29.8 million, or $0.19 per share, after-tax charge resulting from the payment of $49.5 million made in March 2008 associated with the settlement of litigation. Excluding the charge, the 2009 net expenses decreased by $2.3 million as compared to 2008 due primarily to a favorable return on equity investments and lower interest expense. Net income in 2007 included interest income for NU parent on a higher level of cash received from the sale of our competitive generation business in late 2006. 31 Future Outlook EPS Guidance : A summary of our projected 2010 EPS by business, which also reconciles consolidated fully diluted EPS to the non-GAAP financial measures of EPS by business, is as follows: 2010 EPS Range (Approximate amounts) Low High Fully Diluted EPS (GAAP) $ 1.80 $ 2.00 Regulated companies: Distribution segment $ 0.95 $ 1.05 Transmission segment 0.90 0.95 Total regulated companies 1.85 2.00 Competitive businesses - 0.05 NU parent and other companies (0.05) (0.05) Fully Diluted EPS (GAAP) $ 1.80 $ 2.00 We have included estimated impacts from current economic conditions in the assumptions that were used to develop our earnings guidance. The 2010 distribution segment guidance reflects an assumed one percent annual decrease in total weather-normalized retail electric sales, a decrease in Yankee Gas' uncollectibles expense, and uncertainty around the outcomes of the PSNH distribution rate case that was filed in June 2009 and the CL&P distribution rate case filed in January 2010. Both the PSNH and CL&P rate case decisions are expected in mid-2010. A WMECO distribution rate case is expected to be filed in mid-2010 with a decision expected by the end of 2010. A Yankee Gas rate case filing is also being considered. Additional earnings from the WMECO and Yankee Gas filings are not included in the above projections. In 2009, the NU effective tax rate was 34.9 percent. For 2010, we estimate that the effective tax rate for NU will be approximately 34 percent. Long-Term Growth Rate: We project that we will achieve a compound average annual EPS growth rate for the five-year period from 2010 to 2014 of between 6 percent and 9 percent, using 2009 EPS of $1.91 as the base level. This EPS growth rate assumes regulatory ROEs averaging approximately 12.25 percent for the transmission segment and an average of approximately 10 percent for the distribution segment (including PSNH and WMECO generation). We believe this growth will be achieved if our capital program is completed in accordance with our plans, distribution rate case orders enable us to earn the assumed level of regulatory ROEs, and FERC's current transmission policies remain consistent and enable us to achieve projected transmission ROEs. In addition to the assumptions above, there are certain items that will likely impact this earnings growth rate. These items include, but are not limited to, sales levels; oper ating expense levels, including maintenance, pension and uncollectibles expense; and lower margins that NU Enterprises expects to earn on Select Energy remaining contracts. Liquidity Consolidated: We had $27 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2009, compared with $89.8 million as of December 31, 2008. The combined borrowings and letters of credit (LOCs) outstanding on our revolving credit facilities totaled $141.3 million as of December 31, 2009, compared with approximately $706 million as of December 31, 2008. The decrease in short-term borrowings was primarily a result of higher cash flows provided by operating activities, lower capital expenditures, the issuance of approximately 19 million common shares by NU on March 20, 2009, which yielded net proceeds of $370.8 million after offering expenses of $12.5 million, and total 2009 debt issuances of $462 million. On February 13, 2009, CL&P issued $250 million of first mortgage bonds due February 1, 2019 and carrying a coupon of 5.5 percent. On December 14, 2009, PSNH issued $150 million of first mortgage bonds due December 1, 2019 and carrying a coupon of 4.5 percent. Proceeds from these issuances were used to repay short-term debt and fund capital expenditures. On April 1, 2009, using funds borrowed from the NU Money Pool, Yankee Gas retired $50 million of first mortgage bonds carrying a coupon of 6.2 percent that were issued in January 1999. On April 2, 2009, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt PCRBs it had elected to acquire in October 2008. The PCRBs, which mature on May 1, 2031, carry a coupon of 5.25 percent during the current fixed-rate period that ends on the mandatory tender purchase date of April 1, 2010, at which time CL&P expects to remarket the bonds with a new coupon rate set through an auction process. Our planned financings for 2010 total approximately $145 million of new long-term debt to be issued in the first half of the year comprised of $95 million at WMECO and $50 million at Yankee Gas. We have only annual sinking fund requirements of $4.3 million continuing in 2010 through 2012, the mandatory tender of $62 million of PCRBs by CL&P in April 2010, and no debt maturities until April 1, 2012. The proceeds from our 2010 financings will be used primarily to repay short-term borrowings and fund our capital programs. 32 On January 22, 2010, the DPU approved WMECO's application to issue and sell up to $150 million of senior secured or unsecured long-term debt, and WMECO continues to assess whether to issue secured or unsecured debt. If WMECO decides to issue first mortgage bonds, then WMECO will be obligated to secure its $195 million of currently outstanding senior unsecured notes equally and ratably with such first mortgage bonds. We had total outstanding long-term and short-term debt of approximately $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2009, compared with approximately $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2008. The decline reflects a reduction of approximately $520 million in notes payable to banks, partially offset by approximately $400 million in increases to long-term debt. The decline in total debt was due primarily to increased cash flows from operations and the sale of approximately 19 million common shares. We had positive cash flows provided by operating activities in 2009 of $745 million, compared with positive operating cash flows of $424.1 million in 2008 and negative operating cash flows of $5.7 million in 2007 (all amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The improved cash flows in 2009 were due primarily to higher transmission revenues at CL&P after significant projects were placed in service in late 2008, as well as cost management efforts; a decrease of approximately $225 million related primarily to amounts spent on CL&P's Federally Mandated Congestion Charge (FMCC) and Generation Service Charge (GSC), the costs of which are passed on to customers; approximately $100 million less in cash expenditures on fuel, materials and supplies in 2009 due primarily to the lower cost of gas being stored by Yankee Gas for the winter heating season; and the absence in 2009 of the litigation settlement payment o f $49.5 million made in 2008. A cash flow increase due to improved collections of accounts receivable in 2009 was more than offset by increased payments in 2009 from storm costs from December 2008. The increase in operating cash flows from 2007 to 2008 was due primarily to the absence in 2008 of approximately $400 million in tax payments made in 2007 related to the 2006 sale of the Company former competitive generation business. We project consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities of approximately $4 billion from 2010 through 2014, net of RRB payments, ranging from approximately $700 million in 2010 to approximately $1.1 billion in 2014, assuming our capital projects are completed as expected and we receive fair regulatory treatment on related expenditures. We expect the vast majority of our capital programs to be funded through cash flows provided by operating activities and new debt issuances and currently anticipate a single NU common share issuance in the next five years of approximately $300 million, which is expected no earlier than 2012. The projection for 2010 operating cash flows reflects a cash contribution of approximately $45 million, the majority of which will be funded by PSNH, into the Company pension plan in the third quarter of 2010 as described under "Liquidity-Impact of Financial Market Conditions" in this Manage ment's Discussion and Analysis . This contribution will be the first contribution into the Company pension plan in approximately 20 years. In addition, we will potentially contribute approximately $200 million into our pension plan in 2011. A summary of the current credit ratings and outlooks by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) for senior unsecured debt of NU parent and WMECO and senior secured debt of CL&P and PSNH is as follows: Moody's S&P Fitch Current Outlook Current Outlook Current Outlook NU parent Baa2 Stable BBB- Stable BBB Stable CL&P A2 Stable BBB+ Stable A- Stable PSNH A3 Stable BBB+ Stable BBB+ Stable WMECO Baa2 Stable BBB Stable BBB+ Stable In August 2009, Moody completed an industry-wide review of the number of levels between utility first mortgage bonds and utility unsecured debt. Moody stated that its review of utility credit defaults showed a much higher rate of recovery for first mortgage bonds than for unsecured debt. The review resulted in one-level upgrades of CL&P and PSNH first mortgage bonds by Moody s. In the second half of 2009, subsequent to those upgrades, all three rating agencies reaffirmed all of their existing credit ratings and stable outlooks on NU parent, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. On January 22, 2010, Fitch downgraded CL&P preferred stock rating from BBB to BBB- as a result of revised guidelines for rating preferred stock and hybrid securities in general. If NU parent's senior unsecured debt ratings were to be reduced to below investment grade level by either Moody's or S&P, a number of Select Energy's supply contracts would require Select Energy to post additional collateral in the form of cash or LOCs. If such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2009, Select Energy, under its remaining contracts, would have been required to provide additional cash or LOCs in an aggregate amount of $29.8 million to various unaffiliated counterparties and additional cash or LOCs in the aggregate amount of $8.6 million to independent system operators. NU parent would have been and remains able to provide that collateral on behalf of Select Energy. We paid common dividends of $162.4 million in 2009, compared with $129.1 million in 2008 and $121 million in 2007. The increase from 2007 to 2009 is the result of a 6.7 percent increase in our common dividend rate that took effect in the third quarter of 2007, additional 6.3 percent and 11.8 percent increases that took effect in the third quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, respectively, and a higher number of shares outstanding in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009. On February 9, 2010, our Board of Trustees declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.25625 per share, payable on March 31, 2010 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2010, which represents a 7.9 percent increase from the quarterly 2009 common dividend rate. The new annualized rate of $1.025 per share represents an increase of $0.075 per share above the previous annualized rate of $0.95 per share. We target paying out approximately 50 percent of consolidated earnings in the form of common dividends. Our ability to pay common dividends is subject to approval by our Board of Trustees and our future earnings and cash flow requirements and may be limited by certain state statutes, the leverage restrictions in our revolving credit agreement and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay common dividends to NU parent. The Federal Power Act limits the payment of dividends by CL&P, PSNH and WMECO to their respective 33 retained earnings balances unless a higher amount is approved by FERC; PSNH is required to reserve an additional amount of retained earnings under its FERC hydroelectric license conditions. In addition, relevant state statutes may impose additional limitations on the payment of dividends by the regulated companies. CL&P, PSNH, WMECO and Yankee Gas also are parties to a revolving credit agreement that imposes leverage restrictions. In general, the regulated companies pay approximately 60 percent of their earnings to NU parent in the form of common dividends. In 2009, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas paid $113.8 million, $40.8 million, $18.2 million, and $19.1 million, respectively, in common dividends to NU parent. In 2009, NU parent made equity contributions of $147.6 million, $68.9 million, $0.9 million and $2.7 million to CL&P, PSNH, WMECO and Yankee Gas, respectively. Cash capital expenditures included on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and described in this "Liquidity" section do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, the allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and postretirement benefits other than pension (PBOP) expense or income. A summary of our cash capital expenditures by company for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 2007 CL&P $ 435.7 $ 849.5 $ 826.2 PSNH 266.4 238.9 167.7 WMECO 105.4 78.3 47.3 Yankee Gas 54.8 58.3 57.6 Other 45.8 30.4 16.0 Totals $ 908.1 $ 1,255.4 $ 1,114.8 The decrease in our total cash capital expenditures was primarily the result of lower transmission segment capital expenditures, particularly at CL&P, due to the completion in 2008 of three major transmission projects in southwest Connecticut, offset by increases at PSNH and WMECO resulting from higher generation capital expenditures related to the PSNH Clean Air Project and higher transmission capital expenditures related to WMECO's expenditures for the NEEWS project (refer to "Business Development and Capital Expenditures" of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion). As a result of Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank's (LBCB) refusal in 2008 to continue to fund its commitment of approximately $56 million under our credit facilities, our aggregate borrowing capacity under our credit facilities was reduced from $900 million to $844 million. This borrowing capacity, when combined with our access to other funding sources, provides us with adequate liquidity. NU parent credit facility, in a nominal aggregate amount of $500 million, $482.3 million excluding the commitment of LBCB, expires on November 6, 2010. As of December 31, 2009, NU parent had $41 million of LOCs issued for the benefit of certain subsidiaries (primarily PSNH) and $100.3 million of borrowings outstanding under this facility. The weighted-average interest rate on these short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2009 was 0.63 percent, which is based on a variable rate plus an applicable margin based on NU parent's credit ratings. NU parent had approximately $341 million of borrowing availability on this facility as of December 31, 2009, excluding LBCB's commitment, as compared to $101.3 million of availability as of December 31, 2008. The regulated companies maintain a joint credit facility in a nominal aggregate amount of $400 million, $361.8 million excluding the commitment of LBCB, which also expires on November 6, 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2009, and the $361.8 million facility was available. The regulated companies had approximately $56.5 million of aggregate borrowing availability on this facility as of December 31, 2008, excluding LBCB's commitment and subject to each individual company's borrowing limits. Our credit facilities and bond indentures require that NU parent and certain of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including maintaining a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization of no more than 65 percent. All such companies currently are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Refer to Note 2, "Short-Term Debt," and Note 11, "Long-Term Debt," to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of material terms and conditions of these agreements. Impact of Financial Market Conditions: While the impact of continued market volatility and the extent and impacts of the declining economic environment cannot be predicted, we are confident that we currently have operating flexibility and access to funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity. The credit outlooks for NU parent and its regulated companies are all stable. Our companies have low risk of calls for collateral due to our business model, and we have no long-term debt maturing until April 2012. An estimated cash contribution to our pension plan of approximately $45 million is expected to be made in the third quarter of 2010, and we project capital expenditures for 2010 of approximately $1.1 billion. However, we project cash flows provided by operating activities for 2010 of approximately $700 million, net of RRB payments, and, based on our successful financings in 2009, we expect to be able to acces the capital markets in 2010 for our total planned debt issuances of approximately $145 million. While we expect to renew our credit facilities before their November 6, 2010 expiration dates, costs associated with the new facilities will likely be higher than those associated with the existing credit facilities due to changes in credit market conditions. 34 On October 7, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on the Pension Protection Act (PPA) funding rules, which allows us to maximize our funding flexibility by using the October 2008 yield curve rate for the January 1, 2009 valuation of pension plan liabilities. Using the October 2008 yield curve rate, our pension plan funded ratio (the value of plan assets divided by the funding target in accordance with the requirement of the PPA) was 100 percent as of January 1, 2009. As of January 1, 2010, the fair value of our pension plan assets increased by $232.8 million to $1.79 billion, and our estimated pension plan funded ratio was 90 percent. We currently estimate that a contribution of approximately $45 million will be made in the third quarter of 2010 for the purpose of satisfying benefit obligations accrued during 2009. We will potentially make contributions totaling approximately $200 million in 2011. The actual amounts of contributions in 2011 and in future plan years will depend on many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets, valuation of the plan's liabilities, and long-term discount rates. Business Development and Capital Expenditures Consolidated: Our consolidated capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income (all of which are non-cash factors), totaled $969.2 million in 2009, compared with $1.3 billion in both 2008 and 2007. These amounts included $52.7 million in 2009, $33.2 million in 2008, and $16 million in 2007 that related to our corporate service companies that support the regulated companies. Regulated Companies: Capital expenditures for the regulated companies totaled $916.5 million ($446 million for CL&P) in 2009. Transmission Segment : Transmission segment capital expenditures decreased by $422.5 million in 2009, as compared with 2008, due primarily to a $423.3 million reduction in expenditures at CL&P, which completed three major transmission projects in southwest Connecticut in the second half of 2008. A summary of transmission segment capital expenditures by company in 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 2007 CL&P $ 163.0 $ 586.3 $ 660.6 PSNH 61.1 81.9 80.7 WMECO 67.7 46.1 * 20.5 * Totals $ 291.8 $ 714.3 $ 761.8 * Includes $1.9 million in 2008 and $1.2 million in 2007 of capital additions of HWP Company (HWP), formerly known as Holyoke Water Power Company, which were transferred to WMECO in December 2008. In October 2008, CL&P and WMECO made state siting filings in Connecticut and Massachusetts, respectively, for the first and largest component of our New England East-West Solutions (NEEWS) project, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project (GSRP). In October 2009, the New England Independent System Operator (ISO-NE) affirmed the need and need date for GSRP. In Connecticut, hearings have been completed and final briefs were filed in mid-January 2010 with the Connecticut Siting Council (CSC). We believe a final decision may be received from the CSC as early as March 2010. In Massachusetts, hearings were completed in mid-February 2010 with final briefs expected to be filed in the spring. We expect to receive a final decision from the Energy Facilities Siting Board in the third quarter of 2010. GSRP, which involves the construction of a 115 kilovolt (KV)/345 KV line from Ludlow, Massachusetts to Bloomfield, Connecti cut, is the largest and most complicated project within NEEWS and is expected to cost approximately $714 million if built according to our preferred route configuration. Following decisions from the state siting boards, we expect to commence construction in late 2010 and to place the project in service in 2013. Our second major NEEWS project is the Interstate Reliability Project, which is being designed and built in coordination with National Grid USA. CL&P's share of this project includes an approximately 40-mile, 345 KV line from Lebanon, Connecticut to the Connecticut-Rhode Island border where it would connect with enhancements National Grid USA is designing. We estimate CL&P's share of the costs of this project will be approximately $250 million. Municipal consultations concluded in November 2008, and CL&P plans to file its siting application with Connecticut regulators later in 2010, following the completion of ISO-NE reassessment of the need date and issuance of its regional system plan. We currently expect the project to be placed in service in 2014. The third major part of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project, which involves construction of a new line from Bloomfield, Connecticut to Watertown, Connecticut. This line would provide another 345 KV connection to move power across the state of Connecticut. The timing of this project would be six to twelve months behind the Interstate Reliability Project. This project is currently expected to cost approximately $315 million. ISO-NE is currently performing an evaluation of all projects in its regional system plan, including the other components of NEEWS, and assessing the presently estimated need dates for these projects. We expect ISO-NE view on need dates for the second and third major NEEWS projects to be updated in the next version of the regional system plan, which we expect to see as a draft during the third quarter of 2010. Included as part of NEEWS are approximately $211 million of associated reliability related expenditures for projects, over $50 million of which are moving forward through the siting and construction phases and are expected to be completed in advance of the three major projects. We estimate that CL&P's and WMECO's total capital expenditures for NEEWS will be $1.49 billion. Our current capital expenditure and rate base forecasts assume that all NEEWS projects are completed by the end of 2014. However, the timing and amount of our projected annual capital spending could be affected if receipt of siting approvals is delayed or if the need dates for these projects change through ISO-NE's regional system planning process. During the siting approval process, state regulators may require 35 changes in configuration (including placing some lines underground) to address local concerns that could increase construction costs. Our current design for NEEWS does not contemplate any underground lines. Building any lines underground, particularly 345 KV lines, would increase total costs of the project beyond those reflected above. Since inception of NEEWS through December 31, 2009, CL&P and WMECO have capitalized approximately $67.5 million and $74.3 million, respectively, in costs associated with NEEWS, of which $34.2 million and $40 million, respectively, were capitalized in 2009. NU and NSTAR are jointly planning a new, participant-funded, HVDC transmission line from New Hampshire to Canada (HQ tie line project) where it will interconnect with a transmission line being planned by Hydro-Qu bec (HQ), a large Canadian utility. Under the proposed arrangement, NU and NSTAR would sell to HQ 1,200 MW of firm electric transmission service over the HQ tie line project in order for HQ to sell and deliver this same amount of firm electric power from Canadian low-carbon energy resources to New England. The FERC granted approval of the HQ tie line project structure on May 22, 2009. We have made significant progress in the design of the HQ tie line project and reached conceptual agreement in the development of a Transmission Service Agreement (TSA) with HQ. There are several routing options still under technical review and we expect to resolve them by the end of the first half of 2010. We anticipate that we will be filing the TSA with the FERC, which will regulate the tariff charges under the TSA, and the project design with ISO-NE for technical review by mid-2010. In addition, there are a number of state and federal permits that will be required to site the HQ tie line project and we anticipate filing those applications in 2010 as well. Though contingent on timely siting approvals, we currently expect to begin construction of the line in 2012 and have power flowing in 2015 (which coincides with HQ planned completion of several new hydro-electric facilities). We estimate NU's share of this proje ct to be $675 million. In addition, we have started to negotiate a long term power purchase agreement with HQ for power flows over the HQ tie line project. Our intention is to create a power purchase agreement structure that could be offered to other load serving entities in addition to NU and NSTAR. Power purchase agreement terms will be subject to state regulatory approvals and critical to winning state policy maker support for the HQ tie line project. We anticipate these agreements to be filed in 2010 as well. Distribution Segment : Distribution segment capital expenditures increased by $73.6 million in 2009, as compared with 2008, due primarily to increased generation business capital expenditures at PSNH related to its Clean Air Project and the absence in 2009 of a $17.5 million capital cost recovery by Yankee Gas related to a legal settlement in February 2008. A summary of distribution segment capital expenditures by company for 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 2007 CL&P $ 283.0 $ 296.6 $ 283.3 PSNH 98.8 98.2 88.3 WMECO 37.7 37.8 34.0 Totals - electric distribution (excluding generation) 419.5 432.6 405.6 Yankee Gas 59.6 44.0 63.7 Other 0.6 0.5 0.4 Total distribution 479.7 477.1 469.7 PSNH generation 145.0 74.0 35.3 Total distribution segment $ 624.7 $ 551.1 $ 505.0 PSNH's Clean Air Project is a $457 million wet scrubber project at its Merrimack coal station, the cost of which will be recovered through PSNH's default energy service (ES) rates under New Hampshire law. Construction is expected to be under budget and completed in mid-2012. Since inception of the project, PSNH has capitalized approximately $146.8 million associated with this project, of which $119.3 million was capitalized in 2009. Construction of the project was approximately 34 percent complete as of December 31, 2009. On January 6, 2010, the DPUC issued a decision approving Yankee Gas' request to sell its four remaining propane plants that were used to supply gas during peak periods. As a result, in order to meet future supply needs during peak periods, Yankee Gas has initiated a project to construct 16 miles of main gas pipeline between Waterbury, Connecticut and Wallingford, Connecticut and an expansion of the Yankee Gas liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant's vaporization output (collectively, the WWL project), which are estimated to cost $67 million. The WWL Project will connect the LNG storage facility, which is located in Waterbury, Connecticut and is capable of storing the equivalent of 1.2 bcf of natural gas, to areas with growing demand. This project is scheduled to begin construction in the second quarter of 2010 and completed by late 2011. In 2009, Yankee Gas capitalized $0.8 million associated with this project. Strategic Initiatives: We continue to evaluate certain development projects, some of which would benefit our customers, such as investments in AMI systems and other projects that are detailed below: Over the past two years, we have participated in discussions with other utilities, policymakers, and prospective developers of renewable energy projects in the New England region regarding a framework whereby renewable power projects built in rural areas of northern New England could be connected to the electric load centers of New England. We believe there are significant opportunities for developers to build wind and biomass projects in northern New England that could help the region meet its renewable portfolio standards. We believe that a collaborative approach among project developers and transmission owners is necessary to be able to construct needed projects and bring their electrical output into the market. To date, most discussions have been conceptual in nature and therefore we have not yet included any capital expenditures associated with potential projects in our five-year capital program. 36 On December 1, 2009, CL&P filed with the DPUC the results of a three-month dynamic pricing smart meter pilot program that involved nearly 3,000 customers (1,500 residential and 1,500 commercial and industrial (C&I) customers). CL&P plans to file a smart metering and dynamic pricing plan with the DPUC by March 31, 2010. The total cost of the pilot program was approximately $13 million and is being recovered through CL&P FMCC rates. On October 16, 2009, WMECO filed its proposal for a dynamic pricing smart meter pilot program with the DPU. The program proposes to involve 1,750 customers in WMECO's service region for a term of six months beginning in April 2011. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $7 million, which would be recovered through rates WMECO would charge to customers. A decision is expected from the DPU in the first half of 2010. On August 12, 2009, the DPU approved a stipulation agreement between WMECO and the AG concerning WMECO's proposal, under the Massachusetts Green Communities Act (GCA), to install 6 MW of solar energy generation in its service territory at an estimated cost of $41 million. Under the agreement, no more than 3 MW will be commissioned in any one year between 2010 and 2012, the ROE on these assets will be a fully tracking 9 percent, and the benefits of renewable energy and tax credits will be used to reduce the impact on customer bills. WMECO will need to file an additional application with the DPU if it seeks to develop more than the initial 6 MW under the GCA, which allows for electric utility ownership of up to 50 MW of solar energy generating facilities. The estimated capital expenditures discussed below include expenditures for the WMECO solar program. Projected Capital Expenditures and Rate Base Estimates: A summary of the projected capital expenditures for the regulated companies' transmission and the distribution and generation businesses, by company, for 2010 through 2014, including our corporate service companies' capital expenditures on behalf of the regulated companies, is as follows: Year (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2010-2014 Totals CL&P transmission $ 136 $ 203 $ 281 $ 286 $ 155 $ 1,061 PSNH transmission 55 118 107 74 22 376 WMECO transmission 66 256 328 156 6 812 HQ tie line project 16 49 90 236 282 673 Subtotal transmission $ 273 $ 626 $ 806 $ 752 $ 465 $ 2,922 CL&P distribution 305 313 306 305 317 1,546 PSNH distribution 113 111 115 121 134 594 WMECO distribution 33 39 36 35 36 179 Subtotal electric distribution $ 451 $ 463 $ 457 $ 461 $ 487 $ 2,319 PSNH generation 187 117 82 68 26 480 WMECO generation 20 14 7 - - 41 Subtotal generation $ 207 $ 131 $ 89 $ 68 $ 26 $ 521 Yankee Gas distribution 112 104 80 82 83 461 Corporate service companies 48 25 22 25 14 134 Totals $ 1,091 $ 1,349 $ 1,454 $ 1,388 $ 1,075 $ 6,357 Actual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and periods above. The continuation of weak economic conditions in the Northeast could impact the timing of our major transmission projects. Most of these capital investment projections, including those for the HQ tie line project, assume timely regulatory approval, which in some cases requires extensive review. Delays in or denials of those approvals could reduce the levels of expenditures, associated rate base, and anticipated EPS growth. 37 Based on the 2009 actual and 2010 through 2014 projected capital expenditures, the 2009 actual and 2010 through 2014 projected transmission, distribution, and generation rate base as of December 31 of each year are as follows: As of December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 CL&P transmission $ 2,099 $ 2,105 $ 2,134 $ 2,318 $ 2,545 $ 2,563 PSNH transmission 315 335 433 530 608 584 WMECO transmission 183 240 429 665 889 851 HQ tie line project - - - - - 675 Subtotal transmission $ 2,597 $ 2,680 $ 2,996 $ 3,513 $ 4,042 $ 4,673 CL&P distribution 2,119 2,333 2,497 2,629 2,778 2,911 PSNH distribution 772 849 941 1,030 1,090 1,156 WMECO distribution 412 413 434 447 456 461 Subtotal electric distribution $ 3,303 $ 3,595 $ 3,872 $ 4,106 $ 4,324 $ 4,528 PSNH generation 407 404 414 848 874 857 WMECO generation - - 29 31 28 25 Subtotal generation $ 407 $ 404 $ 443 $ 879 $ 902 $ 882 Yankee Gas distribution 691 764 843 892 932 974 Totals $ 6,998 $ 7,443 $ 8,154 $ 9,390 $ 10,200 $ 11,057 Transmission Rate Matters and FERC Regulatory Issues CL&P, PSNH and WMECO and most other New England utilities, generation owners and marketers are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's generation and transmission facilities and the rules by which these parties participate in the wholesale markets and acquire transmission services. Under these arrangements, ISO-NE, a non-profit corporation whose board of directors and staff are independent from all market participants, has served as the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) for New England since February 1, 2005. ISO-NE works to ensure the reliability of the New England transmission system, administers the independent system operator tariff, subject to FERC approval, oversees the efficient and competitive functioning of the regional wholesale power market and determines the portion of the costs of our major transmission facilities that are regionalized throughout New Englan d. Transmission - Wholesale Rates: NU's transmission rates recover total transmission revenue requirements, ensuring that we recover all regional and local revenue requirements. These rates provide for annual true-ups to actual costs. The financial impacts of differences between actual and projected costs are deferred for future recovery from or refund to customers. As of December 31, 2009, NU was in a total underrecovery position of $38.8 million ($28.2 million for CL&P) that will be collected from customers in June 2010. FERC ROE Decision: On March 24, 2008, the FERC issued a rehearing order confirming its initial decision setting the base ROE for transmission projects for the New England transmission owners. Including a final adjustment, the order provides a base ROE of 11.14 percent for the period beginning November 1, 2006. The order also affirmed the FERC's earlier decision granting a 100 basis point adder for transmission projects that are part of the ISO-NE Regional System Plan and are "completed and on line" by December 31, 2008. In addition, while not an issue in this rehearing, the initial order increasing the ROE by 50 additional basis points for transmission owners joining a RTO and giving the RTO operational control of the transmission facilities still stands. This order was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals by numerous state regulators and consumer advocates. On January 29, 2010, the Court unanimously rejected the claims on appeal, confirming FERC award of the 100 basis point adder. It is not known at this time if appellants will seek further review from the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 16, 2008, CL&P filed an application with the FERC to receive ROE incentives for its Middletown-Norwalk project and to seek a waiver of the "completed and on line" date of December 31, 2008 to earn incentives, pursuant to the FERC March 24, 2008 order on rehearing. Alternatively, we requested the FERC to find that this project met the nexus test requirements for incentives under the FERC guidelines for new projects, and requested an additional 50 basis point adder for advanced technology used in the project. In July 2008, the FERC granted the waiver request and approved the 100 basis point ROE incentive for the entire Middletown-Norwalk project. The FERC also found that the project met the nexus test and granted an additional 50 basis point adder for the advanced technology aspects of the 24-mile underground portion of the project. The 50 basis point adder results in a total ROE for the underground portion of the Middletown-Norwalk project of 13.1 percent, which represents the overall ROE limit established by the FERC. Connecticut state regulators have taken an appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. A schedule for the appeal has not yet been set. NEEWS Incentives: On November 17, 2008, the FERC issued an order granting incentives and rate amendments to us and National Grid USA for the NEEWS projects. The approved incentives included: An ROE of 12.89 percent, representing an incentive of 125 basis points; 100 percent inclusion of prudently incurred construction work in progress (CWIP) in rate base; and Full recovery of prudently incurred costs if NEEWS, or any portion thereof, is cancelled as a result of factors beyond NU's or National Grid USA's control. 38 Our share of NEEWS is estimated to cost $1.49 billion, and we received incentives on a portion of the transmission upgrades with a current estimated cost to NU of $1.41 billion. Several parties have sought rehearing of the FERC order granting incentives for NEEWS, which has not yet been acted on by the FERC. Legislative Matters 2009 Federal Legislation: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides resources through grants and loans for several energy-related areas that are relevant to NU, including funding for energy efficiency, smart grid, renewable energy and transmission projects. This legislation also extended tax rules allowing the accelerated deduction of depreciation, which had a positive impact to our 2009 operating cash flows of approximately $100 million. Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Issues : Global climate change and greenhouse gas emission issues have received an increased focus from state governments and the federal government, particularly in the last year. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has initiated a rulemaking addressing greenhouse gas emissions and, on December 7, 2009, issued a finding that concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are "air pollution" and endanger public health and welfare and should be regulated. The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. is the electricity generating sector. Climate change concerns and greenhouse gas issues could lead to additional rules and regulations that impact how we operate our business, both in terms of the generating facilities we own and operate as well as general utility operations. These could include federal cap and trade laws, or regulations requiring additional capital expenditures at our generating facilities. Any such regulations or laws will likely impact PSNH's generating plants and possibly the prices that CL&P and WMECO pay for generation service. In addition, such legislation could potentially impact the prices we pay for goods and services provided by companies directly affected by such legislation. We would expect that any costs of these rules and regulations would be recovered from customers, but such costs could impact energy use by our customers. To date, the regulatory consequences of global climate change have not materially affected us, and it is uncertain what effects, if any, this issue will have on us in the future. For further information see Other Regulatory and Environmental Matters - Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Issues in Item 1, Business . 2009 Massachusetts Legislation: In November 2009, in response to a severe winter storm in December 2008, Massachusetts passed legislation that authorizes the DPU to levy financial penalties if utilities do not follow approved storm plans and puts into law existing requirements for utility storm restoration plans. The new law provides that under a declared state of emergency, the Governor may authorize the DPU Chairman to issue extraordinary temporary orders on utilities to expend funds and redeploy resources to restore service with failure to carry out such an order subject to investigation and a penalty of up to $1 million per violation. The law also codifies existing requirements for utilities to file storm restoration plans and creates significant new financial penalties for late filing and for any failure to implement such plans and requires each utility to submit annual emergency response plans for DPU review and approval. There is no current impact on WMECO financial condition from this legislation. Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Connecticut - CL&P: Distribution Rates: CL&P implemented new distribution rates in 2009 to reflect the DPUC's 2008 decision allowing a $20.1 million annualized increase in distribution rates, effective February 1, 2009. On January 8, 2010, CL&P filed an application with the DPUC to raise distribution rates by $133.4 million, or 3.4 percent over current revenues, to be effective July 1, 2010, and by an additional $44.2 million, or 1.1 percent over current revenues, to be effective July 1, 2011. Among other items, CL&P is seeking an increase in its authorized ROE from the current 9.4 percent to 10.5 percent. CL&P proposed that the first year increase be deferred until January 1, 2011 and that approximately $67 million of cash revenue requirement for the second half of 2010 would be deferred and recovered from CL&P customers between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012. If approved by the DPUC, the application would require an annualized $210 million increase in distribution rates to take effect on January 1, 2011. CL&P expects that as a result of a decline in stranded cost recoveries due to the final amortization of CL&P rate reduction bonds in December 2010, CL&P Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) will decline by approximately $230 million on an annualized basis on January 1, 2011, more than offsetting the impact of the distribution rate increase. Hearings before the DPUC are scheduled to begin in March 2010 and a decision is expected in mid-2010. Standard Service and Last Resort Service Rates: CL&P's residential and small commercial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under Standard Service (SS) rates, and large commercial and industrial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under Last Resort Service (LRS) rates. Effective January 1, 2009, the DPUC approved an increase to CL&P total average SS rate of approximately 2.4 percent and a decrease to CL&P total average LRS rate of approximately 5.9 percent. Effective April 1, 2009, the DPUC approved a decrease to CL&P total average LRS rate of approximately 22 percent. Effective July 1, 2009, the DPUC approved total average SS rates that did not change from the previous rates, though the energy supply portion of the rates increased from 12.316 cents per kilowatt-hour (KWh) to 12.516 cents per KWh. The DPUC also approved a decrease to CL&P's total average LRS rates of approximately 2.3 percent, which was primarily the result of the energy supply portion decreasing to 7.944 cents per KWh. Effective October 1, 2009, the DPUC approved an increase to CL&P's total average LRS rates of approximately 5.8 percent, which was primarily the result of the energy supply portion increasing to 8.657 cents per KWh. Effective January 1, 2010, the DPUC approved a decrease to CL&P total average SS rates of approximately 4.6 percent and an increase in the total average LRS rate of approximately 10.2 percent. The energy supply portion of the total average SS rate decreased from 12.516 cents per KWh to 11.289 cents per KWh. The energy supply portion of the total average LRS rate increased from 8.657 cents per KWh to 9.662 cents per KWh. CL&P is fully recovering from customers the costs of its SS and LRS services. 39 CTA and SBC Reconciliation : On March 31, 2009, CL&P filed with the DPUC its 2008 CTA and Systems Benefits Charge (SBC) reconciliation, which compared CTA and SBC revenues charged to customers to revenue requirements, which allow for full recovery of these amounts. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2008, total CTA revenues exceeded CTA revenue requirements by $84.9 million, which was recorded as a decrease to Regulatory assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2008, the SBC revenues exceeded SBC revenue requirements by $2.5 million, which was recorded as a decrease to Regulatory assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. On September 30, 2009, the DPUC issued a final decision in this docket that approved the 2008 CTA and SBC reconciliations as filed and provided for a subsequent review that resulted in the DPUC incre asing the CTA rate by approximately 0.1 cent per KWh, effective January 1, 2010. FMCC Filing: On February 6, 2009, CL&P filed with the DPUC its semi-annual FMCC filing, which reconciled actual FMCC revenues and charges and GSC revenues and expenses, for the period July 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008, and also included the previously filed revenues and expenses for the January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2008 period. The filing identified an underrecovery for the full year totaling approximately $31.9 million. On November 25, 2009, the DPUC issued a final decision accepting CL&P's calculations as filed. On August 3, 2009, CL&P filed with the DPUC its semi-annual FMCC filing for the period January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2009, which identified a net underrecovery of $7.1 million for that period. On December 16, 2009, the DPUC issued a final decision on this filing accepting CL&P calculations as filed. On February 5, 2010, C L&P filed with the DPUC its semi-annual filing, which reconciled actual FMCC revenues and charges and GSC revenues and expenses, for the period July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009, and also included the previously filed revenues and expenses for the January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2009 period. The filing identified a total net underrecovery of $6.5 million, which includes the remaining uncollected portions of previous filings' underrecoveries and has been recorded as a Regulatory asset on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We do not expect the outcome of the DPUC's review of this filing to have a material adverse impact on CL&P's earnings, financial position or cash flows. Renewable Energy Contracts: In May 2009, pursuant to Connecticut "Act Concerning Energy Independence," the DPUC approved five renewable energy plant projects with total capacity of 27.3 MW. Contracts for the purchase of energy, capacity and renewable energy certificates from these projects have been signed by CL&P and were approved by the DPUC on August 4, 2009. Purchases under the contracts are scheduled to begin from September 2010 through July 2011 and to extend for 15 to 20 years. As directed by the DPUC, CL&P and The United Illuminating Company (UI) have signed a sharing agreement under which they will share the costs and benefits of these contracts with 80 percent to CL&P and 20 percent to UI. CL&P portion of the costs and benefits of these contracts will be paid by or refunded to CL&P customers. Procurement Fee Rate Proceedings: In prior years, CL&P submitted to the DPUC its proposed methodology to calculate the variable incentive portion of its transition service procurement fee, which was effective for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, and requested approval of the pre-tax $5.8 million 2004 incentive fee. CL&P has not recorded amounts related to the 2005 or 2006 procurement fee in earnings. CL&P recovered the $5.8 million pre-tax amount, which was recorded in 2005 earnings, through the CTA reconciliation process. On January 15, 2009, the DPUC issued a final decision in this docket reversing its December 2005 draft decision and stated that CL&P was not eligible for the procurement incentive compensation for 2004. A $5.8 million pre-tax charge (approximately $3.5 million net of tax) was recorded in the 2008 earnings of CL&P, and an obligation to refund the $5.8 million to custom ers was established as of December 31, 2008. CL&P filed an appeal of this decision on February 26, 2009. On February, 4, 2010, the Connecticut Superior Court reversed the DPUC decision. The Court remanded the case back to the DPUC for the correction of several specific errors. We do not yet know if the DPUC will appeal the Court's finding or what the schedule of the remanded case will be. New Hampshire: Merrimack Clean Air Project: On July 7, 2009, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee voted that PSNH Clean Air Project to install wet scrubber technology at its Merrimack Station was not subject to the Committee review as a "sizeable" addition to a power plant under state law. That Committee upheld its decision in an order dated January 15, 2010, denying requests for rehearing. This order was appealed on February 23, 2010; however, we do not believe that the appeal will have a material impact on the timing or costs of the project. On August 5, 2009, the New Hampshire Supreme Court dismissed an appeal of a prior NHPUC ruling on the project, holding the appellants were not harmed and thus lacked standing to bring their challenge. PSNH continues to develop this project, which has a total estimated cost of $457 million and for which construction is approximately 34 percent complete as of December 31, 2009. Distribution Rates : The NHPUC issued an order on July 31, 2009 approving a temporary increase of $25.6 million in PSNH distribution rates on an annualized basis, effective August 1, 2009. Included in the $25.6 million temporary increase is $6 million to begin the recovery of PSNH's approximately $49 million deferral of storm costs incurred in December 2008. On June 30, 2009, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC requesting a permanent increase in distribution rates of approximately $51 million on an annualized basis to be effective August 1, 2009, and another $17 million to be effective July 1, 2010. Hearings before the NHPUC are scheduled for April 2010 and PSNH expects a decision in mid-2010. Any differences between allowed temporary rates and permanent rates will be reconciled back to August 1, 2009. ES and SCRC Rates: On July 23, 2009 and July 24, 2009, the NHPUC approved stranded cost recovery charge (SCRC) and ES rates of 1.14 cents and 9.03 cents per KWh, respectively, which were effective August 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009. On December 22, 2009 and December 31, 2009, the NHPUC approved SCRC and ES rates of 1.18 cents and 8.96 cents per KWh, respectively, which are effective January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. 40 TCAM Rates: On July 24, 2009, the NHPUC approved a transmission cost adjustment mechanism (TCAM) rate of 1.195 cents per KWh, which is effective August 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. ES and SCRC Reconciliation: On an annual basis, PSNH files with the NHPUC an ES/SCRC reconciliation filing for the preceding year. On May 1, 2009, PSNH filed its 2008 ES/SCRC reconciliation with the NHPUC, whose evaluation includes a prudence review of PSNH's generation activities. During 2008, ES revenues exceeded ES costs by $20.7 million, and SCRC costs exceeded SCRC revenues by $6.4 million, resulting in an ES regulatory liability for refunds to customers and a SCRC regulatory asset for costs that will be recovered from customers. PSNH includes these deferrals in the subsequent ES/SCRC rate calculation as a means of refunding/recovering these amounts to/from customers in the next ES/SCRC rate period. On December 30, 2009, the NHPUC approved a settlement on the reconciliation filing that did not have a material adverse impact on PSNH earnings, financial position or cash flows. Massachusetts: Customer Rates: On December 30, 2009, the DPU approved rate changes for WMECO's various tracking mechanisms effective January 1, 2010. On an aggregate basis, these changes resulted in an increase in customer rates of 0.509 cents per KWh, or 3.7 percent. WMECO intends to file a distribution rate case in mid-2010 to be effective January 1, 2011. The distribution rate case will include a proposal, as required by the DPU, to fully decouple distribution revenues from KWh sales. Basic Service Rates : In 2009, basic service rates ranged from 8.554 cents per KWh to 11.805 cents per KWh for residential customers, 9.179 cents per KWh to 12.074 cents per KWh for small commercial and industrial customers, and 7.256 cents per KWh to 10.212 cents per KWh for medium and large commercial and industrial customers. Effective January 1, 2010, the rates for all basic service customers changed to reflect the basic service solicitations conducted by WMECO in November 2009. Basic service rates for residential customers decreased to 8.257 cents per KWh, rates for small commercial and industrial customers decreased to 8.992 cents per KWh and rates for medium and large commercial and industrial customers increased to 8.913 cents per KWh. Transition Cost Reconciliations : On June 2, 2009, the DPU issued a decision on WMECO 2007 transition cost reconciliation, which did not have a material adverse impact on WMECO earnings, financial position or cash flows. On July 2, 2009, WMECO filed its 2008 cost reconciliation for transition, transmission, basic/default service, basic/default service adder, and capital projects scheduling list. The briefing period ended on December 28, 2009. The DPU is expected to issue a decision in 2010. We do not expect the outcome of the DPU's review of this filing to have a material adverse impact on WMECO's earnings, financial position or cash flows. Pension Factor Reconciliation Filing : On July 2, 2009, WMECO filed the 2008 reconciliation for its pension factor revenues and expenses. There is currently no timeline for the DPU's review of this filing. We do not expect the outcome of the DPU's review of this filing to have a material adverse impact on WMECO's earnings, financial position or cash flows. Service Quality Performance Assessment: WMECO is subject to service quality (SQ) metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service. Any charges incurred for failure to meet these standards are paid by WMECO to customers through a method approved by the DPU. WMECO will likely be required to pay assessment charges for its 2008 and 2009 reliability performance against the metrics established for those years, primarily as a result of significant storm activity in 2008 and a power outage impacting WMECO Springfield underground service territory in 2009. WMECO has performed at target for certain other non-storm related reliability metrics. WMECO filed its 2008 SQ results and assessment calculation with the DPU in March 2009 and will file its 2009 information with the DPU in March 2010. In 2009 and 2008, WMECO recorded estimated pre-tax charges of $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, to Net income for these assessments. Deferred Contractual Obligations We have decommissioning and plant closure cost obligations to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPC), Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC) and Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (MYAPC) (Yankee Companies), which have each completed the physical decommissioning of their respective nuclear facilities and are now engaged in the long-term storage of their spent fuel. The Yankee Companies collect decommissioning and closure costs through wholesale, FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with several New England utilities, including our electric utility subsidiaries. These companies recover these costs through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates. Our percentage share of the obligation to support the Yankee companies under FERC-approved rate tariffs is the same as our ownership percentage. For further information, see Note 1K, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Equity Meth od Investments," to the consolidated financial statements. The Yankee Companies are currently collecting amounts that we believe are adequate to recover the remaining decommissioning and closure cost estimates for their respective plants. We believe CL&P and WMECO will recover their shares of these decommissioning and closure obligations from their customers. PSNH has already recovered its share of these costs from its customers. Spent Nuclear Fuel Litigation: In 1998, CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC filed separate complaints against the United States Department of Energy (DOE) in the Court of Federal Claims seeking monetary damages resulting from the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal by January 31, 1998 pursuant to the terms of the 1983 spent fuel and high level waste disposal contracts between the Yankee Companies and the DOE. In a ruling released on October 4, 2006, the Court of Federal Claims held that the DOE was liable for damages to CYAPC for $34.2 million through 2001, YAEC for $32.9 million through 2001 and MYAPC for $75.8 million through 2002. In December 2007, the Yankee Companies each filed subsequent lawsuits against the DOE seeking recovery of actual damages incurred in the years following 2001/2002. 41 In December 2006, the DOE appealed the ruling, and the Yankee Companies filed a cross-appeal. The Court of Appeals issued its decision on August 7, 2008, effectively agreeing with the trial court findings as to the liability of the DOE but disagreeing with the method that the trial court used to calculate damages. The Court of Appeals vacated the decision and remanded the case for new findings consistent with its decision. The refund to CL&P, PSNH and WMECO of any damages that may be recovered from the DOE will be realized through the Yankee Companies' FERC-approved rate settlement agreements, subject to final determination of the FERC. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO cannot at this time determine the timing or amount of any ultimate recovery from the DOE, through the Yankee Companies, on this matter. However, we believe that any net settlement proceeds we receive would be incorporated into FERC-approved recoveries, which would be passed on to our customers through reduced charges. NU Enterprises Divestitures We have exited most of our competitive businesses. NU Enterprises continues to manage to completion its remaining wholesale marketing contracts and to manage its electrical contracting business. Wholesale Marketing: During 2009, Select Energy continued to manage its long-term wholesale energy sales contract with the New York Municipal Power Agency (NYMPA), an agency comprised of municipalities, that expires in 2013, and related energy supply contracts. In addition to the NYMPA portfolio, Select Energy has a contract to operate and purchase the output of a generating facility in New England through mid-2012. Energy Services: Most of NU Enterprises' energy services businesses were sold in 2005 and 2006. Certain other businesses were wound down in 2007, and we continue to wind down minimal activity at the other energy services businesses other than E.S. Boulos Company (Boulos), an electrical contractor based in Maine that we continue to own and manage. NU Enterprises Contracts Wholesale Energy Contracts: NU Enterprises' wholesale energy contracts (managed through its subsidiary Select Energy), which are accounted for as derivatives, are subject to mark-to-market accounting. Numerous factors could either positively or negatively affect the realization of the net fair value amounts of these energy contracts to cash. These factors include: 1) volatility of commodity prices until the derivative contracts result in deliveries, are exited or expire; 2) differences between expected and actual volumes; 3) the performance of counterparties; and 4) other factors. Select Energy has policies and procedures requiring all of its wholesale energy positions to be valued daily and segregating responsibilities between the individuals actually transacting (front office) and those confirming the trades (middle office). The middle office is responsible for determining the portfolio's fair value independent from the front office. The methods Select Energy used to determine the fair value of its wholesale energy contracts are identified and segregated in the table of fair value of wholesale derivative contracts as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. A description of each method is as follows: 1) prices actively quoted primarily represent NYMEX futures and swaps that are marked to closing exchange prices; and 2) prices provided by external sources primarily include over-the-counter forwards and options, including bilateral contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, and are marked to the mid-point of bid and ask market prices. The mid-points of market prices are adjusted to include all applicable market information, such as historical experience with intra-month price volatility and exit pricing assumptions. Currently, a portion of the NYMPA contract's fair value related to intra-month volatility and an exit price premium are determined based upon a model. &nbs p; Generally, valuations of short-term derivative contracts derived from quotes or other external sources are more reliable should there be a need to liquidate the contracts, while valuations for longer-term derivative contracts are less certain. Accordingly, there is a risk that derivative contracts will not be realized at the amounts recorded. The tables below disaggregate the estimated fair value of the wholesale energy derivative contracts. Valuations of individual contracts are broken into their component parts based upon prices actively quoted, prices provided by external sources and model-based amounts. Under accounting guidance for fair value measurements, contracts are classified in their entirety according to the lowest level for which there is at least one input that is significant to the valuation. Therefore, all of these contracts are classified as Level 3 under this guidance. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the sources of the fair value of wholesale energy derivative contracts are included in the following tables: (Millions of Dollars) Fair Value of Wholesale Contracts as of December 31, 2009 Sources of Fair Value Maturity Less than One Year Maturity of One to Four Years Maturity in Excess of Four Years Total Fair Value Prices actively quoted $ (5.5) $ (18.8) $ - $ (24.3) Prices provided by external sources (3.3) (8.1) - (11.4) Model-based (2.0) (7.5) - (9.5) Totals (1) $ (10.8) $ (34.4) $ - $ (45.2) 42 (Millions of Dollars) Fair Value of Wholesale Contracts as of December 31, 2008 Sources of Fair Value Maturity Less than One Year Maturity of One to Four Years Maturity in Excess of Four Years Total Fair Value Prices actively quoted $ (10.1) $ (7.3) $ (1.2) $ (18.6) Prices provided by external sources (2.7) (21.2) (10.0) (33.9) Model-based (1.7) (6.7) (3.0) (11.4) Totals $ (14.5) $ (35.2) $ (14.2) $ (63.9) (1) Excludes $2.1 million of cash collateral posted under master netting agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the changes in fair value of these contracts are included in the following table: Total Portfolio Fair Value 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Fair value of wholesale contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year $ (63.9) $ (94.0) Pre-tax effects of implementing fair value measurement accounting guidance ($3.2 million after-tax) (1) - - (6.1) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year (2) 12.4 29.2 Change in unrealized gains included in pre-tax earnings 6.3 7.0 Fair value of wholesale contracts outstanding at the end of the year $ (45.2) $ (63.9) (1) Pre-tax effect recorded in Fuel, purchased and net interchange power on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

For further information regarding Select Energy's derivative contracts, see Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," to the consolidated financial statements. Counterparty Credit: Counterparty credit risk relates to the risk of loss that Select Energy would incur because of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. Select Energy has established credit policies with regard to its counterparties to minimize overall credit risk. These policies require an evaluation of potential counterparties' financial condition (including credit ratings), collateral requirements under certain circumstances (including cash advances, LOCs, and parent guarantees), and the use of standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. This evaluation results in Select Energy establishing credit limits prior to entering into contracts. The appropriateness of these limits is subject to continuing review. Concentrations among these counterparties may affect Select Energy's ove rall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 98 percent of Select Energy's counterparty credit exposure to wholesale counterparties was non-rated, and approximately 2 percent was collateralized. All of the non-rated credit exposure is comprised of one counterparty, which is a non-rated public entity that we have assessed as creditworthy. To date, this counterparty has met all of its contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Letters of Credit: NU parent provides standby LOCs for the benefit of its subsidiaries under its revolving credit agreement. PSNH posts such LOCs as collateral with counterparties and ISO-NE. As of December 31, 2009, PSNH had posted $39 million in such NU parent LOCs, which includes $10 million with ISO-NE. In addition, Select Energy had posted a $2 million NU parent LOC with ISO-NE as of December 31, 2009. Competitive Businesses: We have various guarantees and indemnification obligations outstanding on behalf of former subsidiaries in connection with the exit from our competitive businesses. See Note 7E, "Commitments and Contingencies - Guarantees and Indemnifications," to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the maximum exposure and amounts recorded under these guarantees and indemnification obligations. Enterprise Risk Management We have implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) methodology for identifying the principal risks to the Company. ERM involves the application of a well-defined, enterprise-wide methodology that will enable our Risk and Capital Committee, comprised of our senior officers, to oversee the identification, management and reporting of the principal risks of the business. However, there can be no assurances that the ERM process will identify and manage every risk or event that could impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The findings of this process are periodically discussed with our Board of Trustees. 43 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our management communicates to and discusses with our Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees critical accounting policies and estimates. The following are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical in nature. See Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to our consolidated financial statements for discussions of these policies and estimates as well as other accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Regulatory Accounting: The accounting policies of the regulated companies conform to GAAP applicable to rate-regulated enterprises and historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process. The application of accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base our conclusion on certain factors, including but not limited to changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and the status of any potential new legislation. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers. We use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe it is probable that the regulated companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded. If we determined that we could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to our operations, or if we could not conclude that it is probable that costs would be recovered or reflected in future rates, the costs would be charged to earnings in the period in which they were incurred. If we determine that a regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery in rates, then we would record the charge in earnings at that time. For further information, see Note 1H, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Accounting," to the consolidated financial statements. Unbilled Revenues: The determination of retail energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers is based on the reading of meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. Billed revenues are based on these meter readings and the majority of recorded revenues is based on actual billings. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and an estimated amount of unbilled revenues is recorded. Unbilled revenues represent an estimate of electricity or gas delivered to customers but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues are included in Operating revenues on the statement of income and are assets on the balance sheet that are reclassified to accounts receivable in the following month as customers are billed. Such estimates are subject to adjustment when actual meter readings become available, when changes in estimating methodology occur and under other circumstances. There were no changes in estimating methodology in 2009. The regulated companies estimate unbilled revenues monthly using the daily load cycle (DLC) method. The DLC method allocates billed sales to the current calendar month based on the daily load for each billing cycle. The billed sales are subtracted from total calendar month sales to estimate unbilled sales. Unbilled revenues are estimated by first allocating sales to the respective rate classes and then applying an average rate to the estimate of unbilled sales. The estimate of unbilled revenues is sensitive to numerous factors, such as energy demands, weather and changes in the composition of customer classes that can significantly impact the amount of revenues recorded. Estimating the impact of these factors is complex and requires our judgment. The estimate of unbilled revenues is important to our consolidated financial statements, as adjustments to that estimate could significantly impact operating revenues and earnings. Wholesale transmission revenues are based on formula rates that are approved by the FERC. These rates are based on forecasted transmission formulas, primarily derived from historical financial results and estimates of forecasted plant in service, which are subject to annual true-ups in the subsequent year. There can be differences in estimated versus actual transmission rates and revenues depending upon a variety of factors, including transmission plant placed in service earlier or later than expected and FERC orders that change the authorized ROEs. For further information, see Note 1E, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues," to the consolidated financial statements. Pension and PBOP: Our subsidiaries participate in a uniform noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (Pension Plan) covering substantially all of our regular employees. In addition to the Pension Plan, we also participate in the PBOP Plan to provide certain health care benefits, primarily medical and dental, and life insurance benefits to retired employees. For each of these plans, the development of the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, funded status and net periodic benefit credit or cost is based on several significant assumptions. If these assumptions were changed, the resulting changes in benefit obligations, fair values of plan assets, funded status and net periodic expense could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 44 Pre-tax periodic pension expense for the Pension Plan was $39.7 million, $2.4 million and $17.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, excluding a one-time termination benefit of $0.3 million in 2007. The pre-tax net PBOP Plan expense was $37.2 million, $36.2 million and $38.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Long-Term Rate of Return Assumptions and Plan Assets : In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumptions for the Pension Plan and the PBOP Plan, we evaluated input from actuaries and consultants, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and historical returns. Our expected long-term rates of return on assets are based on certain target asset allocation assumptions and corresponding assumed rates of returns. We used 8.75 percent for 2009 for the aggregate long-term rate of return on Pension Plan and PBOP Plan life and non-taxable health assets and 6.85 percent for PBOP taxable health assets. We will continue to evaluate these actuarial assumptions at least annually and will adjust them as necessary. We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate. For information regarding actual asset values, see Note 5 A, "Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," to the consolidated financial statements. Investment securities are exposed to various risks, including interest rate, credit and market price volatility. As a result of these risks, the market values of investment securities could increase or decrease in the near term, resulting in a material impact on the value of our plan assets. Increases or decreases in market values could materially affect the future level of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. Actuarial Determination of Expense : Pension and PBOP expense consists of the service cost and prior service cost determined by our actuaries, the interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations and the amortization of the net transition obligation, offset by the expected return on plan assets. Pension and PBOP expense also includes amortization of actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between assumptions and actual or updated information. We calculate the expected return on plan assets by applying our assumed rate of return to a four-year rolling average of plan asset fair values, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This calculation recognizes in plan assets investment gains or losses over a four-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the calculated expected return and the actual return based on the change in the fair value of assets during the year. As of December 31, 2009, total investment losses to be reflected in the four-year rolling average of plan assets over the next four years were $350.4 million and $30.9 million for the Pension Plan and the PBOP Plan, respectively. As these asset losses are reflected in the average plan asset fair values, they will be subject to amortization with other unrecognized gains or losses. The Plans currently amortize unrecogni zed gains or losses as a component of pension and PBOP expense over the average future employee service period of approximately 12 years. As of December 31, 2009, the net actuarial losses on the Pension and PBOP Plan liabilities, also subject to amortization over the next 12 years, were $570 million and $154 million, respectively. Discount Rate : Cash flows related to the Pension Plan or PBOP Plan liability stream are discounted at interest rates applicable to the timing of the cash flow. The discount rate that is utilized in determining future pension and PBOP obligations is based on a yield-curve approach. The yield curve is developed from the top quartile of "AA-rated" Moody and S&P bonds without callable features outstanding as of December 31, 2009. This process calculates the present values of these cash flows and calculates the equivalent single discount rate that produces the same present value for future cash flows. The discount rates determined on this basis are 5.98 percent for the Pension Plan and 5.73 percent for the PBOP Plan as of December 31, 2009. Discount rates used as of December 31, 2008 were 6.89 percent for the Pension Plan and 6.90 percent for the PBOP Plan. Forecasted Expenses and Expected Contributions : Due to the effect of the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and based on the long-term rate of return assumptions, discount rates and other assumptions, we estimate that forecasted expense for the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan will be $79.5 million and $41.2 million, respectively, in 2010, which is included in our earnings guidance. Future actual Pension and PBOP expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans and amounts capitalized. We expect to continue our policy to contribute to the PBOP Plan at the amount of PBOP expense, excluding curtailments and special benefit amounts and adding contributions for the amounts received from the federal Medicare subsidy. We have not been required to make a contribution to the Pension Plan since 1991. As of January 1, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of our Pension Plan assets decreased from prior years due primarily to negative financial market conditions. On October 7, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on the PPA funding rules, which allows us to maximize our funding flexibility by using the October 2008 yield curve rate for the January 1, 2009 valuation of Pension Plan liabilities. Using the October 2008 yield curve rate, our Pension Plan funded ratio (the value of plan assets divided by the funding target in accordance with the requirement of the PPA) was 100 percent as of January 1, 2009. We currently estimate that a contribution of approximately $45 million will be made in the third quarter of 2010 for the purpose of satisfying benefit obligations accrued during 2009, and that contributions totaling approximately $200 million could potentially be made in 2011 (using 24 month segment rates to determine the funding target beginning in 2010). The actual amounts of contributions in 2011 and in future plan years will depend on many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets, valuation of plan liabilities, and long-term discount rates. 45 Sensitivity Analysis : The following represents the increase to the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan reported cost as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points (in millions): As of December 31, Pension Plan Cost Postretirement Plan Cost Assumption Change 2009 2008 2009 2008 Lower long-term rate of return $ 11.1 $ 11.8 $ 1.7 $ 1.3 Lower discount rate $ 12.0 $ 11.6 $ 1.5 $ 1.4 Higher compensation increase $ 6.0 $ 6.2 N/A N/A Health Care Cost : The health care cost trend assumption used to project increases in medical costs was 8 percent for 2009, decreasing one half percentage point per year to an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2015. The effect of increasing the health care cost trend by one percentage point would have increased service and interest cost components of PBOP Plan expense by $0.9 million in 2009. The effect of increasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would have been a $12.9 million impact on the postretirement benefit obligation in 2009. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based test. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to use estimates and judgment. We have selected October 1 st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment testing date. Management has determined that no triggering events occurred in 2009 that would have required interim testing before or after October 1 st . Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, it is written off in the current period to the extent it is impaired. We completed our impairment analysis as of October 1, 2009 for the Yankee Gas goodwill balance of $287.6 million. We determined that the fair value of Yankee Gas substantially exceeds its carrying value and no impairment exists. In performing the required impairment evaluation, we estimated the fair value of the Yankee Gas reporting unit and compared it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimated the fair value of Yankee Gas using discounted cash flow methodologies and an analysis of comparable companies or transactions. This analysis requires the input of several critical assumptions, including future growth rates, cash flow projections, operating cost escalation rates, rates of return, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and long-term earnings and merger multiples of comparable companies. We determined the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model methodology. This methodology uses a weighted average cost of capital in which the ROE is calculated using risk-free rates, stock premiums and a beta representing Yankee Gas' volatility relative to the overall market. The resulting discount rate is intended to be comparable to a rate that would be applied by a market participant. The discount rate fluctuates from year to year as it is based on external market conditions. In 2009, the discount rate increased because the beta was higher in 2009 than 2008. Income Taxes: Income tax expense is estimated annually for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items. Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences resulting from tax credits, non-tax deductible expenses, in addition to various other items, including items that directly impact our tax return as a result of a regulatory activity (flow-through items). The temporary differences and flow-through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the consolidated balance sheets. The income tax estimation process impacts all of our segments. We record income tax expense quarterly using an estimated annualized effective tax rate. Adjustments to the se estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. A reconciliation of expected tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate to actual tax expense recorded is included in Note 1I, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements. We also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets. We follow generally accepted accounting principles to address the methodology to be used in recognizing, measuring and classifying the amounts associated with tax positions that are deemed to be uncertain, including related interest and penalties. The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under this guidance is based on facts, circumstances and information available to us. Once a tax position meets the recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured using a cumulative probability assessment. Assigning probabilities in measuring a recognized tax position and evaluating new information or events in subsequent periods requires significant judgment and could ch ange previous conclusions used to measure the tax position estimate. New information or events may include tax examinations or appeals, developments in case law, settlements of tax positions, changes in tax law and regulations, rulings by taxing authorities and statute of limitation expirations. Such information or events may have a significant impact on our net income, financial position and cash flows. Accounting for Environmental Reserves: Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Adjustments made to environmental reserves could have a significant impact on earnings. Our approach estimates these liabilities based on the most likely action plan from a variety of available options, ranging from no action to establishing institutional controls, full site remediation and long-term monitoring. The estimates associated with each possible action plan are based on findings through various phases of site assessments. 46 These estimates are based on currently available information from presently enacted state and federal environmental laws and regulations and several cost estimates from third-party engineering and remediation contractors. These estimates also take into consideration prior experience in remediating contaminated sites and data released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations. These estimates are subjective in nature partly because there are usually several different remediation options from which to choose when working on a specific site. These estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information concerning either the level of contamination at the site or newly enacted laws and regulations. The amounts recorded as environmental liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets represent our best estimate of the liability for env ironmental costs based on current site information from site assessments and remediation estimates. These liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis. HWP, a subsidiary of NU, continues to evaluate additional potential remediation requirements at a river site in Massachusetts containing tar deposits associated with a manufactured gas plant site, which it sold to Holyoke Gas and Electric (HG&E), a municipal electric utility, in 1902. HWP is at least partially responsible for this site, and has already conducted substantial investigative and remediation activities. HWP first established a reserve for this site in 1994 and has spent approximately $16 million on this site. At this time, we believe that the $1.1 million remaining in the reserve is at the low end of a range of probable and estimable costs of approximately $1.1 million to $1.8 million and will be sufficient for HWP to evaluate the results of additional tar delineation and site characterization studies, evaluate its approach to this matter and conduct certain soft tar remediation. Fair Value Measurements: As of January 1, 2008, we adopted fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). As a result of implementing this guidance, we recorded a net after-tax reduction of 2008 earnings of $3.2 million related to Select Energy remaining wholesale marketing contracts. We also recorded changes in fair value of certain derivative contracts of CL&P. Because CL&P is a cost-of-service, rate regulated entity, the cost or benefit of the contracts is expected to be fully recovered from or refunded to CL&P's customers, and an offsetting regulatory asset or liability was recorded to reflect these changes. If we do not exit but rather serve out our derivative liability contracts, we will not make pa yments for some portion of the negative fair value recorded for the contracts. Likewise, we could receive more cash for derivative assets than the fair value recorded. As of December 31, 2009, we have applied the fair value measurement guidance to the Company's derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value, marketable securities held in NU supplemental benefit trust and WMECO spent nuclear fuel trust, our valuations of investments in our pension and PBOP plans, and nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and AROs. See Note 1G, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Fair Value Measurements," and Note 4, "Fair Value Measurements," to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. We use quoted market prices when available to determine fair values of financial instruments. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not active and model-derived valuations. Derivative contracts are valued using models when quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available. These models incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs. Fair value is modeled using techniques such as discounted cash flow approaches adjusted for assumptions relating to exit price and the Black-Scholes option pricing model, incorporating the terms of the contracts. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy-related product prices for future years for long-dated derivative contracts, future contract quantities under full requirements and supplemental sales contracts, and market volatilities. The observable inputs into the valuation include contract purchase prices and future energy prices for the near term. Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information. Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect nonperformance risk, including credit risk. Changes in fair value of the remaining wholesale marketing contracts of our unregulated businesses are recorded in Fuel, purchased and net interchange power on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, there were net unrealized gains of $3.8 million ($6.3 million pre-tax) related to the valuation of these contracts. Key drivers of variability in fair values include changes in energy prices and expected volumes under the contracts. We utilize judgment in estimating expected volumes that are dependent on a number of factors including options exercised, customer utilization, weather and availability of other power sources to our counterparty. The valuations of our derivative contracts are highly sensitive to changes in market prices of commodities. See Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," included in this Annual Report on Form 10 - -K for a sensitivity analysis of how changes in the prices of commodities would impact earnings. Changes in fair value of the regulated company derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory assets or liabilities, as we expect to recover the costs of these contracts in rates. These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed. Assumptions made in determining fair value have a significant effect on derivative values. Derivative assets are a large portion of our total assets measured at fair value (excluding assets held in our external pension and PBOP trusts), and derivative liabilities comprise almost all of our total liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2009. A significant portion of our derivative liabilities relate to the regulated companies. Changes in fair value do not affect our earnings and are not material to our liquidity or capital resources because the costs and benefits of the contracts are recoverable from or refundable to customers on a timely basis. We review and update our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2009, we held $64.3 million of investment securities in our supplemental benefit trust and $56.8 million of investment securities in our WMECO spent nuclear fuel trust. The fair values of these investments were determined using quoted market prices or other observable inputs. 47 For further information on derivative contracts and marketable securities, see Note 1F, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Derivative Accounting," Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," and Note 9, "Marketable Securities," to the consolidated financial statements.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments: Information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009 is summarized annually through 2014 and thereafter as follows: NU (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Totals Long-term debt maturities (a) (b) $ 66.3 $ 4.3 $ 267.3 $ 305.0 $ 275.0 $ 3,332.8 $ 4,250.7 Estimated interest payments on existing debt (c) 223.5 223.2 222.8 215.6 204.0 2,065.0 3,154.1 Capital leases (d) 2.5 2.5 2.6 2.4 2.0 13.4 25.4 Operating leases (e) 16.5 8.0 7.3 7.0 5.1 22.7 66.6 Funding of pension obligations (e) 45.0 200.0 N/A N/A N/A N/A 245.0 Funding of other postretirement benefit obligations (e) 41.2 41.4 41.4 26.0 24.3 N/A 174.3 Estimated future annual regulated companies costs (f) 758.6 726.6 814.3 696.1 596.4 3,955.5 7,547.5 Estimated future annual NU Enterprises costs (f) 42.8 42.9 40.6 46.6 - - 172.9 Other purchase commitments (e) (h) 1,576.9 - - - - - 1,576.9 Totals (g) (i) $ 2,773.3 $ 1,248.9 $ 1,396.3 $ 1,298.7 $ 1,106.8 $ 9,389.4 $ 17,213.4 CL&P (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Totals Long-term debt maturities (a) (b) $ 62.0 $ - $ - $ - $ 150.0 $ 2,131.7 $ 2,343.7 Estimated interest payments on existing debt (c) 136.2 136.2 136.2 136.2 136.2 1,545.1 2,226.1 Capital leases (d) 1.9 1.9 2.0 2.0 1.8 13.2 22.8 Operating leases (e) 11.8 4.9 4.6 4.5 4.3 25.0 55.1 Funding of other postretirement benefit obligations (e) 16.9 16.9 16.8 9.3 8.7 N/A 68.6 Estimated future annual long-term contractual costs (f) 295.4 418.0 562.6 599.9 502.9 3,629.9 6,008.7 Other purchase commitments (e) (h) 729.2 - - - - - 729.2 Totals (g) (i) $ 1,253.4 $ 577.9 $ 722.2 $ 751.9 $ 803.9 $ 7,344.9 $ 11,454.2 (a) Included in our debt agreements are usual and customary positive, negative and financial covenants. Non-compliance with certain covenants, for example timely payment of principal and interest, may constitute an event of default, which could cause an acceleration of principal payments in the absence of receipt by us of a waiver or amendment. Such acceleration would change the obligations outlined in the table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments. (b) Long-term debt maturities exclude $300.6 million and $243.5 million for NU and CL&P, respectively, of fees and interest due for spent nuclear fuel disposal costs, a positive $13.2 million for NU of net changes in fair value of hedged debt and a negative $5.4 million and $4.8 million for NU and CL&P, respectively, of net unamortized premium and discount as of December 31, 2009. (c) Estimated interest payments on fixed-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the coupon rate on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. Estimated interest payments on floating-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the average of the 2009 floating-rate resets on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. This same rate is then assumed for the remaining life of the debt. Interest payments on debt that have an interest rate swap in place are estimated using the effective cost of debt resulting from the swap rather than the underlying interest cost on the debt, subject to the fixed and floating methodologies. (d) The capital lease obligations include imputed interest of $12.5 million and $11.8 million for NU and CL&P, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. (e) Amounts are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. Funding of pension obligations includes a $200 million potential contribution for 2011 that is subject to change. This amount and contributions in future plan years will depend on many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets, valuation of the plan's liabilities, and long-term discount rates. (f) Other than the net mark-to-market changes on respective derivative contracts held by both the regulated companies and NU Enterprises, these obligations are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. On February 7, 2010, an explosion occurred at the construction site of Kleen Energy Systems, LLC 620 MW generation project with which CL&P has a Contract for Differences (CfD) contract. This event could delay or change CL&P estimated payments under the CfD contract. Currently, management cannot estimate the effects of this recent event on the amounts of CL&P obligations under the CfD contract. Changes in the value of the CfD contract do not impact CL&P's net income. For further information, see Note 19, Subsequent 48 Event, and Note 7C, Commitments and Contingencies - Long-Term Contractual Arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements. (g) Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $124.3 million for NU and $89 million for CL&P as of December 31, 2009, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the potential amounts of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. (h) Amount represents open purchase orders, excluding those obligations that are included in the capital leases, operating leases, estimated future annual regulated company costs and the estimated future annual NU Enterprises costs. These payments are subject to change as certain purchase orders include estimates based on projected quantities of material and/or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. Because payment timing cannot be determined, we include all open purchase order amounts in 2010. (i) For NU, excludes other long-term liabilities, including a significant portion of the unrecognized tax benefits described above, deferred contractual obligations ($166.2 million), environmental reserves ($26 million), various injuries and damages reserves ($36.9 million), employee medical insurance reserves ($6.5 million), long-term disability insurance reserves ($11.8 million) and the asset retirement obligation (ARO) liability reserves ($50.6 million) as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the timing of payments. For CL&P, excludes unrecognized tax benefits described above, deferred contractual obligations ($114.5 million) environmental reserves ($2.7 million), various injuries and damages reserves ($24.3 million), employee medical insurance reserves ($2.1 million), long-term disability insurance reserves ($3.6 million) and the ARO liability reserves ($28.6 million). RRB amounts are non-recourse to us, have no required payments over the next five years and are not included in this table. The regulated companies' standard offer service contracts and default service contracts are also not included in this table. For further information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see the consolidated statements of capitalization and Note 2, "Short-Term Debt," Note 5A, "Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," Note 7C, "Commitments and Contingencies - Long-Term Contractual Arrangements," Note 10, "Leases," and Note 11, "Long-Term Debt," to the consolidated financial statements.

Net income was $69 million higher for 2009 as compared to 2008 due primarily to the absence of a $29.8 million after-tax litigation settlement charge in 2008 and higher transmission and distribution earnings. Net income was $14 million higher in 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the growth in the Company's transmission segment, partially offset by the $29.8 million after-tax litigation settlement charge. Comparison of 2009 to 2008 Operating Revenues For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Variance Electric distribution $ 4,359 $ 4,716 $ (357) Gas distribution 449 577 (128) Total distribution 4,808 5,293 (485) Transmission 578 425 153 Regulated companies 5,386 5,718 (332) Competitive businesses 81 114 (33) Other & Eliminations (28) (32) 4 NU $ 5,439 $ 5,800 $ (361) Operating revenues decreased $361 million in 2009 due primarily to lower distribution revenues from the regulated companies ($485 million) as a result of the recovery of a lower level of electric and gas distribution fuel and other expenses passed through to customers through regulatory tracking mechanisms. Electric distribution revenues decreased $357 million due primarily to a decrease in the portion of electric distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($395 million), partially offset by an increase in the component of revenues that impacts earnings ($37 million). The portion of electric distribution segment revenues that impacts earnings increased $37 million due primarily to higher CL&P and PSNH retail rates, partially offset by lower retail electric sales. Retail electric sales for the regulated companies decreased 3.5 percent. Gas distribution revenues decreased $128 million due primarily to decreased recovery of fuel costs primarily as a result of lower prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Firm natural gas sales increased 6.9 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. The $395 million decrease in electric distribution revenues that does not impact earnings consists of the portions of distribution revenues that are included in regulatory commission approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs ($356 million) and revenues that are eliminated in consolidation of the regulated companies ($39 million). The distribution revenue tracking components decreased $356 million due primarily to lower recovery of generation service and related congestion charges ($331 50 million) and lower CL&P wholesale revenues as a result of decreased market revenue related to sales of Independent Power Producers (IPP) purchased generation output ($163 million), partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($104 million) mainly as a result of the higher 2009 retail rates. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. Transmission segment revenues increased $153 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base as a result of the completion of our southwest Connecticut projects in 2008 and higher overall expenses. Competitive businesses' revenues decreased $33 million due primarily to lower Boulos revenues as a result of less work on transmission projects and a lower level of work in other areas. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expenses decreased $367 million in 2009 due primarily to lower costs at the regulated companies. Fuel and purchased power expense from the regulated companies decreased at CL&P ($155 million) due to lower GSC supply costs and other purchased power costs, partially offset by an increase in deferred fuel costs, at Yankee Gas ($133 million) due to a decrease in gas prices in 2009 as compared to 2008, at WMECO ($45 million) due primarily to lower Basic/Default supply costs, and at PSNH ($38 million) due to an increased level of migration of ES customers to competitive supply and lower retail sales, partially offset by higher forward energy market prices. Other Operation Other operation expenses decreased $20 million in 2009 due primarily to lower NU parent and other companies' expenses ($49 million) and lower competitive businesses' expenses ($39 million), partially offset by higher regulated companies' distribution and transmission segment expenses ($68 million). NU parent and other companies' expenses were lower by $49 million in 2009 due primarily to the absence of the $49.5 million payment resulting from the settlement of litigation made in 2008 ($29.8 million after-tax). Competitive businesses' expenses were lower by $39 million due primarily to lower Boulos expenses as a result of a lower level of work. Higher regulated companies' distribution and transmission segment expenses of $68 million were due primarily to higher electric distribution segment expenses ($49 million), higher expenses at Yankee ($18 million), and higher transmission segment expenses ($15 million), partially offset by lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($8 million), and all other operating costs ($6 million). The higher operations expenses impacting earnings include higher uncollectible and pension expenses. Maintenance Maintenance expenses decreased $20 million in 2009 due primarily to lower regulated companies' distribution expenses ($21 million), partially offset by higher transmission line expenses ($1 million). Distribution expenses were lower due primarily to lower repair and maintenance of distribution lines ($15 million), including lower storm-related expenses, lower equipment maintenance expenses ($4 million), and lower PSNH generation expenses ($3 million), partially offset by higher vegetation management expenses ($5 million). Depreciation Depreciation expenses increased $31 million in 2009 due primarily to higher transmission ($23 million) and distribution ($11 million) plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of regulatory assets, net expenses decreased $173 million in 2009 for the distribution segment due primarily to lower amortization at CL&P resulting from a lower recovery of stranded costs ($131 million) as a result of lower retail CTA revenues and higher transition costs, partially offset by higher amortization of the SBC balance ($15 million). The decreases for PSNH and WMECO are $39 million and $15 million, respectively. Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs expenses increased $13 million in 2009, which corresponded to the reduction in principal of the RRBs. Taxes Other than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes expenses increased $15 million in 2009 due primarily to higher property taxes ($18 million) as a result of higher plant balances and increased municipal tax rates and higher payroll related taxes, partially offset by the resolution of various routine tax issues primarily surrounding sales and use tax amounts ($8 million). Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $4 million in 2009 due primarily to higher long-term debt interest ($31 million) resulting from the issuance of new long-term debt in 2008 and 2009, partially offset by lower RRB interest resulting from lower principal balances outstanding ($14 million), and lower other interest ($13 million) mostly related to the resolution of various routine tax issues. Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased $13 million in 2009 due primarily to lower AFUDC equity income ($20 million) as a result of lower eligible CWIP balances, the absence of interest income related to the federal tax settlement in 2008 ($10 million), and lower CL&P Energy Independence Act incentives ($6 million), partially offset by higher investment income due primarily to improved results from NU's supplemental benefit trust and the absence of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in 2008 ($24 million). 51 Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $74 million in 2009 due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($50 million), lower tax benefits associated with less capital expenditures ($10 million), lower federal and state tax credits ($4 million), and increases in allowance for uncollectible accounts reserves ($3 million). Comparison of 2008 to 2007 Operating Revenues For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2008 2007 Variance Electric distribution $ 4,714 $ 4,927 $ (213) Gas distribution 577 514 63 Total distribution 5,291 5,441 (150) Transmission 396 283 113 Regulated companies 5,687 5,724 (37) Competitive businesses 113 98 15 NU $ 5,800 $ 5,822 $ (22) Operating revenues decreased $22 million in 2008 due primarily to lower revenues from the regulated companies ($37 million), partially offset by higher revenues from competitive businesses ($15 million). The lower regulated companies revenues were due primarily to the recovery of a lower level of CL&P distribution related expenses passed through to customers through regulatory tracking mechanisms. Competitive businesses revenues increased $15 million despite our continued exit from components of the competitive businesses due to higher Boulos revenues resulting from increased contractor billings ($10 million) and higher market prices for the remaining Select Energy wholesale contracts. Certain Select Energy contracts expired during 2008. Revenues from the regulated companies decreased $37 million due to lower distribution segment revenues ($150 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment revenues ($113 million). Distribution segment revenues decreased $150 million due primarily to lower electric distribution revenues ($213 million), partially offset by higher gas distribution revenues ($63 million). Transmission segment revenues increased $113 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base, the impact of the March 24, 2008 FERC ROE decision and higher operating expenses that are passed through to customers under FERC-approved transmission tariffs. Electric distribution revenues decreased $213 million due primarily to the portion of revenues that does not impact earnings ($281 million) as a result of distribution revenue being included in regulatory tracking mechanisms and consolidation eliminations of transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment, partially offset by the component of revenues that impacts earnings ($68 million). The portion of the electric distribution segment revenues that impacts earnings increased $68 million due primarily to increases in retail rates at each of the regulated companies ($89 million), partially offset by lower retail electric sales ($16 million). Retail electric sales decreased 3.5 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. Gas distribution revenues increased $63 million due primarily to increased recovery of fuel costs, the rate increase effective July 1, 2007 and higher firm gas sales. Firm gas sales increased 2. 1 percent in 2008 compared with 2007. The $281 million electric distribution revenue decrease that does not impact earnings was due to the portions of distribution revenues that are included in regulatory commission approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs ($179 million) and revenues that are eliminated in consolidation ($102 million). The distribution revenue tracking components decreased $179 million due primarily to lower recovery of generation service and related congestion charges ($233 million) and CL&P delivery-related FMCC ($75 million) and lower PSNH SCRC ($55 million), partially offset by higher CL&P wholesale revenues due primarily to an increase in the market revenue related to sales of IPP generation to ISO-NE ($59 million) and higher CL&P and PSNH retail transmission revenues ($82 million) mainly as a result of the higher 2008 retail rates and higher CL&P SBC revenue ($36 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expenses decreased $354 million in 2008 due to lower costs at the regulated companies ($364 million), partially offset by higher competitive businesses expenses ($9 million). Fuel and purchased power expense from the regulated companies decreased primarily at CL&P due to lower GSC supply costs, a decrease in deferred fuel costs and lower other purchased power costs. The decrease in GSC supply costs was due primarily to a reduction in load caused primarily by customer migration to third party suppliers and lower retail sales ($432 million), partially offset by higher Yankee Gas expenses ($41 million) due primarily to higher fuel prices in 2008 and higher PSNH fuel expense ($28 million) due primarily to higher forward energy market prices, partially offset by a decrease in payments to higher priced IPPs in 2008 as contracts expired. Competitive businesses' expenses increased due to higher Sel ect Energy purchased power expenses related to the remaining wholesale contracts. Other Operation Other operation expenses increased $60 million in 2008 due primarily to higher NU parent and other companies expenses ($54 million), higher competitive businesses' expenses ($6 million) and higher regulated companies distribution and transmission segment expenses ($1 million). 52 NU parent and other companies' expenses were higher by $54 million in 2008 due primarily to the absence of the $49.5 million payment resulting from the settlement of litigation. Competitive businesses' expenses were higher by $6 million due primarily to higher operating costs at the remaining services businesses. Higher regulated companies' distribution and transmission segment expenses of $1 million were due primarily to higher transmission segment expenses ($8 million), expenses at Yankee ($6 million) and higher electric distribution segment expenses ($4 million), partially offset by all other operating costs ($18 million). Maintenance Maintenance expenses increased $43 million in 2008 due primarily to higher regulated companies' distribution expenses ($38 million) and higher transmission line expenses ($4 million). Distribution expenses were $38 million higher due primarily to higher PSNH generation expenses ($15 million) mainly related to the Merrimack Station maintenance outages, higher vegetation management ($9 million), higher overhead line maintenance expenses ($5 million), substation equipment ($3 million) and line transformers ($2 million). Depreciation Depreciation expenses increased $13 million in 2008 due primarily to higher regulated transmission and distribution plant balances resulting from completed construction programs placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of regulatory assets, net expenses increased $146 million in 2008 for the distribution segment due primarily to higher amortization at CL&P ($144 million) resulting from a higher recovery of transition costs ($62 million), higher amortization of the SBC balance ($50 million) and a credit in 2007 pertaining to the refund of the GSC overrecovery ($29 million). Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs expenses increased $4 million in 2008, which corresponds to the reduction in principal of the RRBs. This increase was partially offset by a decrease at PSNH resulting from the retirement of $50 million of RRBs in the first quarter of 2008. Taxes Other than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes expenses increased $15 million in 2008 due primarily to higher Connecticut gross earnings tax ($16 million) mainly as a result of higher CL&P and Yankee Gas revenues that are subject to gross earnings tax and higher property taxes at CL&P and PSNH ($5 million) as a result of higher plant balances and higher local municipal tax rates, partially offset by lower payroll taxes charged to expense ($5 million). Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $29 million in 2008 due primarily to higher long-term debt interest ($31 million) resulting from the issuance of new long-term debt in 2007 and 2008 and higher other interest ($9 million) mostly related to short-term debt, partially offset by lower RRB interest resulting from lower principal balances outstanding ($11 million). Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased $11 million in 2008 due primarily to lower investment income ($16 million) due primarily to the absence of the higher NU investment income interest earned in 2007 on cash the parent received from the November 2006 sale of NU's competitive generation, higher investment losses ($14 million) due primarily to NU supplemental benefit trust and lower equity in earnings of regional nuclear generating and transmission companies ($2 million), partially offset by higher AFUDC equity income ($12 million) and interest income related to the federal tax settlement in 2008 ($10 million). Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased $4 million in 2008 due primarily to the settlement of litigation ($20 million), flow-through items related to depreciation ($6 million), partially offset by impacts associated with higher pre-tax earnings ($22 million). 53 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES The components of significant income statement variances, higher/(lower) in comparison to the previous year, are provided in the table below. Income Statement Variances 2009 versus 2008 2008 versus 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Amount Percent Amount Percent Operating Revenues $ (134) (4) % $ (123) (3) % Operating Expenses: Operation - Fuel, purchased and net interchange power (155) (8) (432) (19) Other operation 13 2 22 4 Maintenance (12) (10) 22 21 Depreciation 24 15 11 7 Amortization of regulatory assets, net (118) (72) 144 (a) Amortization of rate reduction bonds 10 7 10 7 Taxes other than income taxes 12 7 11 7 Total operating expenses (226) (7) (212) (6) Operating Income 92 25 89 31 Interest expense, net 10 7 8 6 Other income, net (16) (38) 2 5 Income before income tax expense 66 25 83 45 Income tax expense 41 53 25 49 Net income $ 25 13 % $ 58 43 % (a) Percent greater than 100 not shown since not meaningful. Comparison of the Year 2009 to the Year 2008 Operating Revenues Operating revenues decreased $134 million in 2009 due to lower distribution segment revenues ($264 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment revenues ($130 million). The distribution segment revenues decreased $264 million due primarily to a decrease in the portion of distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($289 million). These revenues do not impact earnings, primarily as a result of the inclusion of these distribution revenues in regulatory tracking mechanisms and intracompany revenues that are eliminated in consolidation. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $25 million. The $289 million decrease in distribution segment revenues that does not impact earnings was due primarily to a decrease in the portions of retail revenues that are included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through CL&P's tariffs ($265 million) and transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($24 million). The distribution revenues included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms decreased $265 million due primarily to a decrease in revenues associated with the recovery of GSC and supply-related FMCC ($184 million) and lower wholesale revenues as a result of decreased market revenue related to sales of CL&P's IPP purchased generation output to ISO-NE due to a decrease in the market price of energy ($163 million), partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($75 million). The lower GSC and supply-related FMCC revenue was due primarily to lower retail sales, lower customer rates resulting from lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third-party suppliers in 2009 as compared to 2008. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $25 million primarily as a result of rate changes, partially offset by lower retail sales. The 2009 retail sales as compared to the same period in 2008 decreased 17.6 percent for the industrial, 2.9 percent for the commercial, and 0.7 percent for the residential classes. Total retail sales decreased overall by 3.8 percent. Transmission segment revenues increased $130 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base as a result of the completion of our southwest Connecticut projects in 2008 and higher overall expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expenses decreased $155 million in 2009 due primarily to lower GSC supply costs ($280 million) and other purchased power costs ($41 million), partially offset by an increase in deferred fuel costs ($165 million), all of which are included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms. The $280 million decrease in GSC supply costs was due primarily to lower retail sales, lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third-party suppliers. These GSC supply costs are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to various suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply SS and LRS load through a competitive solicitation process. The $165 million increase in deferred fuel costs was due primarily to the combined effect of the twelve months of 2008 net underrecovery of GSC and FMCC expenses as compared to the twelve months of 2009 net overrecovery of these expenses. 54 Other Operation Other operation expenses increased $13 million in 2009 as a result of higher distribution segment expenses ($36 million) due primarily to pension and expenses related to uncollectible receivable balances, and higher transmission segment expenses, which are tracked and recorded through FERC rate tariffs ($14 million), partially offset by lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($30 million), and lower transmission segment intracompany billing to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($6 million). Maintenance Maintenance expenses decreased $12 million in 2009 due primarily to lower repair and maintenance of distribution lines ($6 million), including lower storm expenses, lower distribution substation equipment expenses ($2 million), lower transmission segment expenses ($1 million), and lower transformer maintenance expenses ($1 million). Depreciation Depreciation expenses increased $24 million in 2009 due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service in the transmission segment ($19 million) and the distribution segment ($5 million). Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of regulatory assets, net expenses decreased $118 million in 2009 due primarily to lower amortization related to the recovery of stranded charges ($131 million) as a result of lower retail CTA revenue and higher transition costs, partially offset by higher amortization of the SBC balance ($15 million). Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs expenses increased $10 million in 2009, which corresponded to the reduction in principal of the RRBs. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes expenses increased $12 million in 2009 due primarily to higher property taxes as a result of higher plant balances and increased municipal tax rates ($10 million), higher gross earnings taxes ($4 million) recoverable in rates mainly as a result of higher transmission revenues that are subject to gross earnings tax, and higher payroll taxes ($2 million), partially offset by the resolution of various routine tax issues primarily surrounding sales and use tax amounts ($4 million). Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $10 million in 2009 due primarily to higher long-term debt interest ($28 million) resulting from the $300 million debt issuance in May 2008 and the $250 million debt issuance in February 2009, partially offset by lower other interest ($9 million) mostly related to the resolution of various routine tax issues, and lower RRB interest resulting from lower principal balances outstanding ($10 million). Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased $16 million in 2009 due primarily to lower AFUDC equity income ($18 million) as a result of lower eligible CWIP due to large transmission projects being completed and placed in-service in 2008 and lower capital expenditures in 2009, the absence in 2009 of interest income related to a federal tax settlement in 2008 ($6 million), and lower Energy Independence Act incentives ($6 million), partially offset by higher investment income due primarily to improved results from NU's supplemental benefit trust and the absence of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in 2008 ($16 million). Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $41 million due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($23 million), less tax benefits as a result of lower capital expenditures ($9 million), lower state tax credits ($3 million), and increases in allowance for doubtful accounts reserves ($4 million). Comparison of the Year 2008 to the Year 2007 Operating Revenues Operating revenues decreased $123 million in 2008 due to lower distribution segment revenues ($233 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment revenues ($110 million). The distribution segment revenues decreased $233 million due primarily to a decrease in the portion of distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($296 million). These revenues do not impact earnings, primarily as a result of the inclusion of these distribution revenues in regulatory tracking mechanisms and intercompany revenues that are eliminated in consolidation. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $62 million. The $296 million decrease in distribution segment revenue that does not impact earnings was due primarily to the portions of retail revenues that are included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through CL&P tariffs ($217 million) and transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($78 million). The distribution revenue included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms decreased $217 million due primarily to a decrease in revenues associated with the recovery of GSC and supply-related FMCC ($314 million) and delivery-related FMCC ($75 million), partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($65 million) mainly as a result of higher 2008 rates, higher wholesale revenues ($59 million), and higher SBC revenues ($36 million). The lower GSC and supply-related FMCC revenue was due primarily 55 to a reduction in load, caused primarily by customer migration to third-party suppliers, lower congestion costs and lower sales in 2008. The lower delivery-related FMCC revenue was due primarily to a decrease in this rate component in 2008 as a result of lower reliability must run (RMR), VAR support and southwest Connecticut energy resource costs in 2008, as well as a larger prior year overrecovery being refunded to customers in 2008 as compared to 2007. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of the revenues that impacts earnings increased $62 million due primarily to the rate increase effective February 1, 2008 ($75 million), partially offset by lower retail sales ($10 million). Retail sales decreased 3.7 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Transmission segment revenues increased $110 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base, the impact of the March 24, 2008 FERC ROE decision and higher operating expenses that are passed through to customers under FERC-approved transmission tariffs. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expenses decreased $432 million in 2008 due primarily to lower GSC supply costs ($231 million), a decrease in deferred fuel costs ($174 million) and lower other purchased power costs ($27 million), all of which are included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms. The $231 million decrease in GSC supply costs was due primarily to a reduction in load caused primarily by customer migration to third party suppliers and lower retail sales. These GSC supply costs are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to various suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply standard service (SS) and last resort service (LRS) load through a competitive solicitation process. The $174 million decrease in deferred fuel costs was due primarily to the combined effect of CL&P having a supply and delivery-related net FMCC overrecovery in 2007 and a supply and delivery-related net FMCC underrecovery in 2008. Other Operation Other operation expenses increased $22 million in 2008 as a result of higher costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($104 million) such as retail transmission ($59 million), RMR ($17 million), higher uncollectibles ($12 million), higher tracked administrative and general expenses ($9 million), and higher Energy Independence Act (EIA) expenses ($6 million). In addition, there were higher transmission segment expenses ($5 million), partially offset by lower transmission segment intracompany billing to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($80 million), and lower distribution segment expenses ($8 million) due primarily to lower pension, regulatory assessments and workers compensation expenses, partially offset by a charge to refund the 2004 procurement incentive fee that was recognized in 2005 earnings. Maintenance Maintenance expenses increased $22 million in 2008 due primarily to higher distribution overhead lines ($10 million), due primarily to more storms in 2008 compared to 2007, higher vegetation management expenses ($6 million), higher transmission segment expenses ($4 million), and higher distribution substation equipment expenses ($2 million). Depreciation Depreciation expenses increased $11 million in 2008 due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction programs placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of regulatory assets, net expenses increased $144 million in 2008 due primarily to higher amortization related to the recovery of transition charges ($62 million), a higher recovery and lower expenses for SBC ($50 million), and a credit in 2007 pertaining to the refund of the GSC overrecovery ($29 million). Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs expenses increased $10 million in 2008, which corresponded to the reduction in principle of the RRBs. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes expenses increased $11 million in 2008 due primarily to higher gross earnings taxes recoverable in rates as a result of higher distribution revenues that are subject to gross earnings tax ($13 million) and higher property taxes as a result of increased plant balances and increased municipal tax rates ($2 million), partially offset by lower payroll taxes charged to expense ($3 million). Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $8 million in 2008 due primarily to higher long-term debt interest ($21 million) resulting from the $200 million debt issuance in September 2007, the $300 million debt issuance in March 2007 and the $300 million debt issuance in May 2008, partially offset by lower RRB interest resulting from lower principal balances outstanding ($9 million), and lower other interest ($3 million) mostly related to short-term debt. Other Income, Net Other income, net increased $2 million in 2008 due primarily to higher AFUDC equity income ($9 million) as a result of higher eligible CWIP due to the transmission construction program, higher interest income related to the federal tax settlement in 2008 ($6 million) and higher EIA incentives ($2 million), partially offset by higher investment losses ($10 million) due primarily to the NU supplemental benefit trust, a decrease in conservation and load management (C&LM) incentive income ($3 million), and a decrease in investment income ($2 million). 56 Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $25 million in 2008 due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings being subject to tax at marginal rates, partially offset by flow-through items associated with property plant and equipment differences and uncollectible account reserves, thereby reducing the effective tax rate. LIQUIDITY CL&P had cash flows from operating activities in 2009 of $482.2 million, compared with operating cash flows of $267.3 million in 2008 and $4.5 million in 2007 (all amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). The improved cash flows in 2009 were due primarily to higher transmission revenues after significant projects were placed in service in late 2008 as well as cost management efforts; a decrease of approximately $200 million related primarily to amounts spent on the FMCC, GSC and C&LM, the costs of which are passed on to customers; a cash flow increase due to improved collections of accounts receivable in 2009 offset by increases in the negative cash flow effect of our accounts payable balances related to operating activities and change in the amount of income tax refunds or payments. We project cash flows provided by operating activities at CL&P of approximately $440 million in 2010, net of RR B payments. In 2009, CL&P reduced its borrowings under the $400 million credit facility it shares with the other regulated companies by $188 million. CL&P can borrow up to $200 million under this facility. Other financing activities in 2009 included the $250 million bond issuance in February 2009, the remarketing of $62 million of tax-exempt PCRBs and cash capital contributions from NU parent of $147.6 million, offset by $102.7 million in repayment of NU Money Pool borrowings and $113.8 million in common dividends paid to NU parent. Cash capital expenditures included on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, the AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income. CL&P's cash capital expenditures totaled $435.7 million in 2009, compared with $849.5 million in 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of lower transmission segment capital expenditures in 2009 due to the completion in 2008 of three major transmission projects in southwest Connecticut. Other investing activities in 2009 included lendings to the NU Money Pool of $97.8 million. We project capital expenditures at CL&P of $441 million in 2010 (including non-cash factors). While the impact of continued market volatility and the extent and impacts of the declining economic environment cannot be predicted, we are confident that CL&P currently has operating flexibility and access to funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity. In the second half of 2009, all three rating agencies reaffirmed all of their existing credit ratings and stable outlooks on CL&P. On January 22, 2010, Fitch downgraded CL&P preferred stock rating from BBB to BBB- as a result of revised guidelines for rating preferred stock and hybrid securities in general. Capital contributions from NU parent and other internal sources of funding are provided to CL&P as necessary. CL&P has the mandatory tender of $62 million in 2010, which it plans to remarket, but does not have any long-term debt maturities until 2014, and there are no CL&P debt issuances planned for 2010. 57 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES The components of significant income statement variances, higher/(lower) in comparison to the previous year, are provided in the table below.

Comparison of the Year 2009 to the Year 2008 Operating Revenues Operating revenues decreased $31 million in 2009 due to lower distribution segment revenues ($46 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment revenues ($15 million). The distribution segment revenues decreased $46 million due primarily to a decrease in the portion of distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($57 million). These revenues do not impact earnings, primarily as a result of the inclusion of these distribution revenues in regulatory tracking mechanisms and intracompany revenues that are eliminated in consolidation. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $11 million primarily as a result of higher retail rates, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes. The 2009 retail sales as compared to the same period in 2008 decreased 8.2 percent for the industrial, 1.5 percent for the commercial, and 0.2 percent for the residential classes. Total retail sales decreased overall by 2.2 percent. The $57 million decrease in the portion of distribution segment revenues that does not impact earnings was due primarily to a decrease in the portions of retail revenues that are included in NHPUC approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through PSNH's tariffs ($47 million) and transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($9 million). The distribution revenues included in NHPUC approved tracking mechanisms decreased $47 million due primarily to lower purchased fuel and power costs ($99 million), partially offset by an increase in the SCRC ($27 million), higher retail transmission revenues ($14 million), higher wholesale revenue ($8 million), and higher Northern Wood Power Plant renewable energy certificate revenues ($4 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or u ndercollections recovered from customers in future periods. Transmission segment revenues increased $15 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base and higher expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, purchased and net interchange power costs decreased $38 million in 2009 due primarily to an increased level of migration of ES customers to competitive supply and lower retail sales, partially offset by higher forward energy market prices. Other Operation Other operation expenses increased $24 million in 2009 as a result of higher distribution segment expenses ($15 million), mainly as a result of higher administrative and general expenses, including higher pension and medical costs, and higher expenses related to uncollectible receivable balances, and higher retail transmission expenses that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($10 million). Maintenance Maintenance expenses decreased $4 million in 2009 due primarily to lower repair and maintenance of distribution lines ($7 million), including lower storm costs, lower generation expenses primarily as a result of lower maintenance outage expenses at Merrimack Station ($2 million) and hydro expenses incurred in 2008 primarily as a result of two major dam resurfacing projects ($1 million), partially offset by higher vegetation management expenses ($5 million). 58 Depreciation Depreciation expense increased $6 million in 2009 due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service in the distribution segment ($3 million) and the transmission segment ($2 million). Amortization of Regulatory (Liabilities)/Assets, Net Amortization of regulatory (liabilities)/assets, net expense decreased $39 million in 2009 due primarily to a decrease in net deferrals associated with the ES and TCAM tracking mechanisms, partially offset by an increase in net deferrals associated with the SCRC tracking mechanism. Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs expense increased $2 million in 2009, which corresponded to the reduction in principal of the RRBs. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes expenses increased $6 million in 2009 due primarily to higher property taxes as a result of higher net plant balances and increased local municipal tax rates ($7 million), partially offset by lower sales taxes as a result of the resolution of various routine tax issues ($1 million). Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $4 million in 2009 due primarily to lower RRB interest resulting from lower principal balances outstanding ($3 million) and lower other interest ($1 million) mostly related to the resolution of various routine tax issues. Other Income, Net Other income, net increased $2 million in 2009 due primarily to higher investment income related to improved results from the NU supplemental benefit trust and the absence of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in 2008, and higher interest income related to the return on the December 2008 ice storm, partially offset by the absence in 2009 of interest income related to a federal tax settlement in 2008 and lower AFUDC equity income due to higher short-term debt, which resulted in a lower rate based on borrowing costs. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $10 million in 2009 due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($6 million) and less favorable depreciation deduction adjustments ($2 million). Comparison of the Year 2008 to the Year 2007 Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased $58 million in 2008 due to higher distribution segment revenues ($46 million) and higher transmission segment revenues ($12 million). The distribution segment revenues increased $46 million due primarily to an increase in the portion of distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($37 million). These revenues do not impact earnings, primarily as a result of the inclusion of these distribution revenues in regulatory tracking mechanisms and consolidation eliminations of transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $8 million primarily as a result of rate changes ($13 million) from increases effective July 1, 2007 and January 1, 2008, partially offset by a rate decrease effective July 1, 2008. The combined increase in rates is partially offset by lower retail sales ($4 million). Retail sales decreased 2.5 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. The $37 million increase in distribution segment revenues that does not impact earnings was due primarily to an increase in the portions of retail revenues that are included in NHPUC approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs ($55 million) through PSNH tariffs, partially offset by transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($18 million). The distribution revenue included in NHPUC approved tracking mechanisms increased $55 million due primarily to the pass-through of higher purchased fuel and power costs ($78 million), higher retail transmission revenues ($17 million), higher wholesale revenues ($8 million), and higher Northern Wood Power Plant renewable energy certificate revenues ($3 million), partially offset by a decrease in the SCRC ($55 million) due primarily to a decrease in the SCRC rate effective July 1, 2008. The tracking mech anisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. Transmission segment revenues increased $12 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base, the impact of the March 24, 2008 FERC ROE decision and higher operating expenses that are passed through to customers under FERC-approved transmission tariffs. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, purchased and net interchange power costs increased $28 million in 2008 due primarily to higher forward energy market prices, partially offset by a decrease in payments to higher priced IPPs in 2008 as contracts expired. 59 Other Operation Other operation expenses increased $7 million in 2008 as a result of higher costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($13 million) due primarily to retail transmission. In addition, there were higher distribution segment expenses ($10 million) due primarily to higher customer account and storm restoration expenses, and higher transmission segment expenses ($2 million), partially offset by lower transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($18 million). Maintenance Maintenance expenses increased $17 million in 2008 due primarily to higher generation segment expenses that are tracked and recovered through an NHPUC approved tracking mechanism ($15 million) primarily as a result of the Merrimack Station maintenance outages with the remainder of the increase due primarily to higher distribution segment expenses related to storms and the Reliability Enhancement Program (REP) that began on July 1, 2007. Depreciation Depreciation expense increased $3 million in 2008 due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction programs placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory (Liabilities)/Assets, Net Amortization of regulatory (liabilities)/assets, net expense increased $2 million in 2008 primarily as a result of increased recoveries of previously deferred storm costs. Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs expense decreased $7 million in 2008 due primarily to the retirement of $50 million of RRBs in the first quarter of 2008. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes expenses increased $2 million in 2008 due primarily to higher property taxes ($3 million) as a result of higher net plant balances and higher local municipal tax rates, partially offset by lower payroll taxes ($1 million). Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $4 million in 2008 due primarily to higher long-term debt interest ($7 million) resulting primarily from the $70 million debt issuance in September 2007 and the $110 million debt issuance in May 2008, partially offset by lower RRB interest resulting from lower principal balances outstanding ($2 million). Other Income, Net Other income, net increased $1 million in 2008 due primarily to higher AFUDC equity income as a result of a higher eligible CWIP and lower short-term debt resulting in an increase in CWIP financed by equity ($2 million) and higher interest income related to the federal tax settlement in 2008 ($2 million), partially offset by higher investment losses ($2 million) due primarily to the NU supplement benefit trust and lower investment income ($1 million). Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased $1 million in 2008 due primarily to lower flow-through items related to property, plant and equipment, partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings. LIQUIDITY PSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2009 of $58.2 million, compared with operating cash flows of $116.4 million in 2008 and $95.5 million in 2007, all amounts are net of RRB payments included in financing activities. The decrease in 2009 operating cash flows is due primarily to an increase of $119.7 million in the negative cash flow effect of accounts payable balances as a result of, among other things, costs related to the major storm in December 2008 that were paid to vendors in 2009 and deferred. These costs are currently recovered from customers at an annual rate of $6 million, beginning August 1, 2009, pursuant to the temporary rate case settlement. This level of recovery could be modified once PSNH's permanent distribution rate case is decided in mid-2010. In addition, the 2009 operating cash flow decrease was due to the $11.7 million change in the amount of income tax refunds or payments. The operating cash flow decrease was offset by improved operating results, insurance settlement proceeds and a decrease in the negative cash flow impact from various other working capital items, such as fuel, materials and supplies of $26.3 million. 60 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY The components of significant income statement variances, higher/(lower) in comparison to the previous year, are provided in the table below.

Comparison of the Year 2009 to the Year 2008 Operating Revenues Operating revenues decreased $39 million in 2009 due to lower distribution segment revenues ($47 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment revenues ($8 million). The distribution segment revenues decreased $47 million due primarily to a decrease in the portion of distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($49 million). These revenues do not impact earnings, primarily as a result of the inclusion of these distribution revenues in regulatory tracking mechanisms and intracompany revenues that are eliminated in consolidation. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $1 million. The $49 million distribution segment revenues decrease that does not impact earnings was due primarily to a decrease in the portions of retail revenues that are included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through WMECO's tariffs ($44 million) and transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($5 million). The distribution revenues included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms decreased $44 million due primarily to lower energy supply costs ($48 million), lower transition cost recoveries ($10 million), and lower wholesale revenues ($5 million), partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($15 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The 2009 retail sales as compared to the same period in 2008 decreased 11.7 percent for the industrial, 4.8 percent for the commercial, and 1.6 percent for the residential classes. Total retail sales decreased overall by 4.8 percent. Transmission segment revenues increased $8 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base and higher expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expenses decreased $45 million in 2009 due primarily to lower Basic/Default Service supply costs ($47 million) and lower other purchased power costs ($2 million), partially offset by higher deferral of excess Basic/Default Service revenue over Basic/Default Service expense ($4 million). The Basic/Default Service supply costs are the contractual amounts we must pay to various suppliers that serve this load after winning a competitive solicitation process. These costs decreased as a result of lower supplier contract rates and reduced load volumes. To the extent that these costs do not match the revenues collected from customers, the DPU allows the difference to be deferred for future collection or refund. Lower other purchased power costs are due primarily to a decrease in costs associated with customer generation and IPPs. Other Operation Other operation expenses increased $9 million in 2009 as a result of higher retail transmission and other costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($11 million), partially offset by lower distribution segment expenses ($2 million) mainly as a result of lower administrative and general expenses. 61 Maintenance Maintenance expenses decreased $3 million in 2009 due primarily to lower repair and maintenance of distribution lines including lower storm expenses and lower vegetation management expense. Depreciation Depreciation expenses increased $1 million in 2009 due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory (Liabilities)/Assets, Net Amortization of regulatory (liabilities)/assets, net expenses decreased $15 million in 2009 due primarily to the deferral of allowed transition costs that are in excess of transition revenues, resulting from a decrease in the transition cost portion of the rate and lower IPP revenue than previous years. Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs expenses increased $1 million in 2009, which corresponded to the reduction in principal of the RRBs. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes expenses increased $1 million in 2009 due primarily to higher property taxes as a result of higher plant balances and increased municipal tax rates. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $4 million due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings. Comparison of the Year 2008 to the Year 2007 Operating Revenues Operating revenues decreased $23 million in 2008 due to lower distribution segment revenues ($26 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment revenues ($3 million). The distribution segment revenues decreased $26 million due primarily to a decrease in the portion of distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($24 million). These revenues do not impact earnings, primarily as a result of the inclusion of these distribution revenues in regulatory tracking mechanisms and intracompany revenues that are eliminated in consolidation. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings decreased $2 million. The $24 million decrease in distribution segment revenues that does not impact earnings was due primarily to a decrease in the portions of retail revenues that are included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through WMECO tariffs ($18 million) and transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($6 million). The distribution revenue included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms decreased $18 million due primarily to lower retail transmission revenues ($12 million) and lower pension tracker and default service true-up revenues ($8 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of the revenues that impacts earnings decreased $2 million due primarily to lower retail sales ($2 million) and a service quality performance assessment charge ($1 million), partially offset by the rate increase effective January 1, 2008 ($2 million). Retail sales decreased 4.2 percent in 2008 compared to 2007. Transmission segment revenues increased $3 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base, the impact of the March 24, 2008 FERC ROE decision and higher operating expenses that are passed through to customers under FERC-approved transmission tariffs. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expenses increased $1 million in 2008 due primarily to higher Basic/Default Service supply costs, partially offset by an increased deferral of Excess Basic Service expense over Basic Service revenue and lower amortization of the CT Yankee regulatory asset. The Basic Service Supply costs are the contractual amounts we must pay to various suppliers that serve basic service load after winning a competitive solicitation process. To the extent these costs do not match the revenues collected from customers, the DPU allows the difference to be deferred for future collection or refund from customers. Other Operation Other operation expenses decreased $22 million in 2008 as a result of lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($20 million) such as retail transmission ($11 million) and lower tracked administrative and general expenses mainly due to pension expense ($9 million). In addition, transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation reduced expenses ($6 million), partially offset by higher distribution segment expenses ($2 million) due primarily to higher uncollectible expenses and higher transmission segment expenses ($1 million). Maintenance Maintenance expenses increased $2 million in 2008 due primarily to vegetation management expenses as a result of storms. 62 Amortization of Regulatory (Liabilities)/Assets, Net Amortization of regulatory (liabilities)/assets, net expenses increased $2 million in 2008 due primarily to the deferral of transition revenues collected in excess of allowed transition costs resulting mainly from higher power contract market values. Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds Amortization of RRBs expenses increased $1 million in 2008, which corresponded to the reduction in principal of the RRBs. Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased $2 million in 2008 due primarily to higher investment losses ($2 million) due primarily to the NU supplemental benefit trust and lower investment income ($2 million), partially offset by higher interest income related to the federal tax settlement in 2008 ($1 million) and higher AFUDC equity income as a result of a higher eligible CWIP and lower short-term debt resulting in an increase in CWIP financed by equity ($1 million). Income Tax Expense/(Benefit) Income tax expense decreased $4 million in 2008 due primarily to lower pre-tax earnings. LIQUIDITY WMECO had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2009 of $47.7 million, compared with operating cash flows of $53.9 million in 2008 and $24.9 million in 2007, all amounts are net of RRB payments included in financing activities. The decrease in 2009 cash flows was due to an increase of $41.6 million in the negative cash flow effect of accounts payable balances partially as a result of costs related to the major storm in December 2008 that were paid to vendors in 2009. These costs were deferred and are expected to be recovered from customers. WMECO anticipates filing a distribution rate case in mid-2010, which would include a request for the timely recovery of the December 2008 storm costs. This impact was offset by a decrease in the negative cash flow from various other working capital items, such as accounts receivable and unbilled revenues of $18 million, and improved operating results.
