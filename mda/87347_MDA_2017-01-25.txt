Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 2016 Executive Overview On April 1, 2016, Schlumberger completed its acquisition of Cameron, combining their complementary portfolios into a pore-to-pipeline products and services offering for the world oil and gas industry. The transaction enables the creation of technology-driven growth by integrating Schlumberger reservoir and well technology with Cameron wellhead and surface equipment, flow control and processing technology. Schlumberger revenue of $27.8 billion in 2016 represented a decrease of 22% from 2015, despite three quarters of activity from the acquired Cameron Group, which contributed $4.2 billion in revenue. Excluding the Cameron Group, revenue declined 34%. This revenue drop was due to continued weakness in exploration and production spending as a result of the deepest and longest industry crisis in more than 30 years. The year began with Brent crude prices experiencing the sharpest fall in 30 years to $26 per barrel in January 2016, thus continuing the downturn that the oil and gas industry endured during the previous year. Given two successive years of investment cuts, oil supply growth slowed significantly despite record OPEC production. Non-OPEC production fell sharply, largely due to a significant drop in US light tight oil production. However, robust global demand enabled the oil markets to tighten and draw down on the vast accumulation of crude and product stocks by mid-year. The year end was marked by OPEC and certain non-OPEC countries, including Russia, agreeing to cut production by a combined 1.7 million barrels per day. These agreements are expected to accelerate the drawdown of stocks in 2017 and have subsequently spurred a recovery in oil prices, which reached $55 per barrel at the end of 2016. In the natural gas markets, US production declined during 2016 as a result of the drop in gas drilling activity, while demand growth was robust throughout the year. Low gas prices during most of 2016 encouraged the power sector to continue to favor gas over coal. The year was also marked by the start-up of the Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Texas, which exported its first shipment in early 2016, thus starting a trend that should make the US the third largest exporter of LNG by the end of 2020. Europe continued to see modest demand growth due in part to coal plant retirements. Gas prices, however, fell to a seven-year low as supplies from Russia, Norway and North Africa reached record highs. The Asian markets continued to be in slow growth mode, albeit with slight improvements in China. Nonetheless, oversupply persisted as Australian LNG exports ramped up, driving LNG prices down even further from the already low-levels of 2015. The global outlook for LNG is largely unchanged, with continued oversupply and low prices. Schlumberger financial performance in 2016 was severely impacted by the significant decrease in land-based activity, particularly in North America where the average land rig count dropped 46% as compared to the previous year. Supply overcapacity in the land market remained high for most of 2016, resulting in pricing pressure across a broad range of oilfield services. As a result, North America revenue, excluding the impact of the Cameron Group, declined 48% due to a decrease in US land revenue of 52%. Including the Cameron Group, North America revenue decreased 32%. Internationally, revenue declined 28%, excluding the impact of Cameron (17% including the Cameron Group) due to customer budget cuts, activity disruptions and a shift in revenue mix that impacted Schlumberger results in most basins and market segments around the world. Revenue in the Europe, CIS & Africa Area decreased due to lower demand for exploration and development-related products and services as E&P budgets were reduced, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Latin America, revenue declined due to customer budget constraints across the Area and, more specifically, in Venezuela where operations were scaled back to align with collections. Middle East & Asia revenue decreased primarily due to reduced activity in Asia-Pacific countries, while robust activity in the Middle East was more than offset by pricing concessions. Since the start of this downturn, and as it deepened during 2016, Schlumberger has navigated the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share and also by proactively removing significant costs through workforce reductions, internal efficiency improvements and strong supply chain management. As a result, Schlumberger has delivered superior financial results by maintaining pretax operating margins well above 10% and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic capital investments, as well as our ongoing dividend commitments. 14 After nine quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized in the third quarter of 2016 and revenue increased slightly in the fourth quarter, suggesting that the bottom of this cycle has been reached. Schlumberger expects the growth in E&P investments in 2017 to be led initially by land operators in North America. E&P spending surveys currently indicate that 2017 E&P investments in North America will increase by approximately 30%, which should lead to both higher activity and a recovery in service industry pricing. Schlumberger expects the 2017 recovery in the international markets to proceed more slowly than in North America. This will likely lead to a third successive year of underinvestment, with a continued low rate of new project approvals and an accelerating production decline in the aging production base. These factors taken together are increasing the likelihood of a significant supply deficit in the medium term, which can only be avoided by a broad-based global increase in E&P spending, which is expected to start unfolding in the later parts of 2017 and leading into 2018. Fourth Quarter 2016 Results (Stated in millions) Fourth Quarter 2016 Third Quarter 2016 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 1,699 $ 316 $ 1,689 $ 322 Drilling 2,013 234 2,021 218 Production 2,179 132 2,083 98 Cameron 1,346 188 1,341 215 Eliminations & other (130 ) (60 ) (115 ) (38 ) Pretax operating income 810 815 Corporate & other (1) (245 ) (267 ) Interest income (2) 23 24 Interest expense (3) (126 ) (135 ) Charges & credits (4) (675 ) (237 ) $ 7,107 $ (213 ) $ 7,019 $ 200 (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. (2) Excludes interest income included in the segments income (fourth quarter 2016: $7 million; third quarter 2016: $7 million). (3) Excludes interest expense included in the segments income (fourth quarter 2016: $13 million; third quarter 2016: $14 million). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Fourth-quarter revenue of $7.1 billion increased 1% sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by the Production Group, which grew 5% due to increased hydraulic fracturing activity in the Middle East and in North America land. Fourth-quarter pretax operating margin was essentially flat sequentially at 11.4% as margin improvements in the Production and Drilling Groups were balanced by contractions in the Cameron and Reservoir Characterization Groups. Reservoir Characterization Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.7 billion increased 1% sequentially due to the ramp-up in Testing & Process activity in Kuwait and increased software license and maintenance sales. These effects were slightly offset by the seasonal decrease in Wireline activity in Norway and Russia. P retax operating margin of 19% decreased 49 basis points (bps) sequentially as the increased contribution from software and maintenance sales was more than offset by the decline in high-margin Wireline activities. 15 Drilling Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $2.0 billion was flat sequentially as the continued strong directional drilling activity in North America land was offset by lower drilling activity in the International Areas. The improvement in North America revenue primarily came from increased uptake of Drilling & Measurements, Bits & Drilling Tools technologies. The lower revenue in the International Areas was primarily due to completed Drilling & Measurement projects, while the winter slowdown in Russia and Norway affected Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO activity. Pretax operating margin of 12% expanded 81 bps sequentially despite revenue being flat. This was largely due to pricing improvements from greater uptake of drilling technologies on increasing activity on land in the US, which mainly affected Drilling & Measurements and Bits & Drilling Tools. Production Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $2.2 billion increased 5% sequentially as a result of strong fracturing activity on unconventional resource developments on land in the Middle East, mainly in Saudi Arabia, and in North America where the land rig count and fracturing stage count increased. Revenue on land in the US increased both on volume and on a modest pricing recovery. Pretax operating margin of 6% increased 134 bps sequentially on increased activity, which drove efficiency and better operational execution in the Middle East. The modest pricing recovery on land in the US also contributed to the margin expansion. Cameron Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion was flat sequentially. Among the Group businesses, OneSubsea reported an 11% sequential increase from strong project activity and execution, while Surface Systems posted strong sales in the Middle East. These increases, however, were offset by a decline in revenue in Drilling Systems driven by a declining backlog and lower bookings. Valves & Measurement was also lower following the prior quarter strong international shipments . Pretax operating margin of 14% declined 207 bps sequentially due to the drop in high-margin Drilling Systems project volume. Full-Year 2016 Results (Stated in millions) 2016 2015 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 6,743 $ 1,228 $ 9,738 $ 2,465 Drilling 8,561 994 13,563 2,538 Production 8,709 528 12,311 1,570 Cameron 4,211 653 - - Eliminations & other (414 ) (130 ) (137 ) (63 ) Pretax operating income 3,273 6,510 Corporate & other (1) (925 ) (768 ) Interest income (2) 84 30 Interest expense (3) (517 ) (316 ) Charges & credits (4) (3,820 ) (2,575 ) $ 27,810 $ (1,905 ) $ 35,475 $ 2,881 (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. Full-year 2016 includes $189 million of amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of Cameron, which was completed on April 1, 2016. (2) Excludes interest income included in the segments income (2016: $26 million; 2015: $22 million). (3) Excludes interest expense included in the segments income (2016: $53 million; 2015: $30 million). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 16 Full-year 2016 revenue of $ 27.8 billion decreased 22 % year-on-year. This included nine months of activity from the acquired Cameron Group, which contributed $ 4.2 billion of revenue. Full-year 2016 revenue from the Reservoir Characterization and Production Groups declined by 31% and 29%, respectively, as a result of lower demand for exploration- and development-related products and services as E&P budgets were further reduced. Drilling Group revenue fell 37% due to the rig count decline in both North America and internationally. Full-year 2016 pretax operating income margin decreased 658 bps to 12% as a result of the overall decline in activity and pervasive pricing concessions. The margin decrease was highest in the Reservoir Characterization Group, which contracted by 710 bps to 18%. Drilling Group pretax operating margin fell 710 bps to 12%, while the Production Group decreased 669 bps to 6%. The Cameron Group posted a pretax margin of 16%. Reservoir Characterization Group Full-year 2016 revenue of $6.7 billion decreased 31% year-on-year primarily due to sustained cuts in exploration and discretionary spending. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 710 bps to 18% due to reduced high-margin Wireline and Testing Services activities. Drilling Group Full-year 2016 revenue of $8.6 billion decreased 37% year-on-year primarily due to the severe drop in rig count in both North America and internationally combined with pricing pressure that mainly affected Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO activity. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 710 bps to 12% primarily due to the significant decline in higher-margin activities of Drilling & Measurements combined with pricing weakness. Production Group Full-year 2016 revenue of $8.7 billion decreased 29% year-on-year with most of the decrease attributable to a decline in North America, particularly on Well Services pressure pumping technologies driven by activity declines and pricing pressure as the land rig count declined dramatically. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 669 bps to 6% as a result of lower activity and increasing pricing pressure, which continued to impact North America land. Cameron Group Cameron Group contributed nine-month revenue of $4.2 billion and pretax operating margin of 16%. Revenue was impacted by a declining project backlog as well as a further slowdown in North America land activity, which also affected the short-cycle businesses of the Valves & Measurement and Surface product lines. Pretax operating margin of 16% was driven by strong project execution and manufacturing efficiency in OneSubsea and overall cost control across the Group. 17 Full-Year 2015 Results (Stated in millions) 2015 2014 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 9,738 $ 2,465 $ 13,339 $ 3,770 Drilling 13,563 2,538 18,128 3,805 Production 12,311 1,570 17,329 3,130 Eliminations & other (137 ) (63 ) (216 ) (129 ) Pretax operating income 6,510 10,576 Corporate & other (1) (768 ) (848 ) Interest income (2) 30 31 Interest expense (3) (316 ) (347 ) Charges and credits (4) (2,575 ) (1,773 ) $ 35,475 $ 2,881 $ 48,580 $ 7,639 (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. (2) Excludes interest income included in the segments income (2015: $22 million; 2014: $20 million). (3) Excludes interest expense included in the segments income (2015: $30 million; 2014: $22 million). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Full-year 2015 revenue of $35.5 billion decreased 27% year-on-year. This decrease was primarily due to customer budget cuts and pricing concessions as customers responded to lower commodity prices. Revenue was also impacted by the fall of certain currencies against the US dollar, which accounted for approximately 20% of the revenue decline. Full-year 2015 revenue from the Reservoir Characterization and Drilling Groups declined by 27% and 25%, respectively, as a result of lower demand as E&P budgets were reduced due to lower commodity prices. Production Group revenue fell by 29% due to activity reductions and pricing pressure as the land rig count dropped drastically in North America. Full-year 2015 pretax operating income margin decreased 342 bps to 18% as a result of the overall decline in activity combined with the pricing pressure which most notably impacted the businesses in North America. Reservoir Characterization Group Full-year 2015 revenue of $9.7 billion was 27% lower than the same period last year primarily due to sustained customer cuts in exploration and discretionary spending that impacted all Technologies. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 295 bps to 25% as a result of an unfavorable overall revenue mix reflecting the decline in high-margin exploration activity as well as lower high-margin multiclient and software sales. Drilling Group Full-year 2015 revenue of $13.6 billion was 25% lower than the previous year primarily due to the severe drop in rig count in North America, reduced activity levels and service pricing concessions internationally . Unfavorable currency effects in Russia and Venezuela also contributed to the decline. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 228 bps to 19%, primarily due to a decrease in higher-margin activities of Drilling & Measurements as well as pricing concessions. Despite the revenue decline, prompt action on cost management and the benefit of a local cost structure that minimized the impact of unfavorable currency effects on pretax operating income helped limit the operating margin decline. 18 Production Group Full-year 2015 revenue of $12.3 billion decreased 29% year-on-year, with approximately two-thirds of the decline attributable to Well Services pressure pumping technologies as a result of activity reductions and pricing pressure as the land rig count declined dramatically in North America. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin declined 531 bps to 13% as lower activity and increasing pricing pressure continued in North America land. Interest and Other Income Interest & other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Interest income $ 110 $ 52 $ 51 Earnings of equity method investments 90 184 240 $ 200 $ 236 $ 291 The increase in interest income in 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014 is primarily attributable to the higher cash and short-term investment balances as a result of the issuance of $6.0 billion of Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in earnings of equity method investments primarily reflects the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas industry, which has negatively impacted the majority of Schlumberger investments in affiliates, particularly those in North America. The decrease in 2016 also reflects the fact that Schlumberger stopped recording equity income from the OneSubsea joint venture in April 2016 as a result of Schlumberger acquisition of Cameron. Interest Expense Interest expense of $570 million in 2016 increased by $224 million compared to 2015 primarily due to the issuance of $6.0 billion of Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the impact of the $3.0 billion of debt assumed in the acquisition of Cameron. Interest expense of $346 million in 2015 decreased by $23 million compared to 2014, as the impact of a higher weighted average debt balance of approximately $0.5 billion was more than offset by a 30 bps decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from 2.8% in 2014 to 2.5% in 2015. Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue , were as follows: 2016 2015 2014 Research & engineering 3.6 % 3.1 % 2.5 % General & administrative 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.0 % Although Research & engineering and General & administrative costs have either increased or remained flat as a percentage of Revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015, they have decreased in absolute dollar terms as a result of cost control measures that have been implemented, offset in part by the impact of the Cameron acquisition. Income Taxes The Schlumberger effective tax rate was 14.6% in 2016, 25.9% in 2015, and 25.2% in 2014. The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase. 19 The effective tax rate for each of 2016 , 201 5 and 201 4 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolida ted Financial Statements because they were only partially tax effective . Excluding the impact of these charges and credits, the effective tax rate was 15.9 % in 201 6 , 20.2 % in 201 5 and 21.9 % in 201 4 . The decrease in the effective tax rate, excluding the impact of charges and credits, was primarily attributable to a change in the geographic mix of earnings and the favorable resolution of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions . It is expected that the effective tax rate will gradually increase over the course of 2017 as a result of the expected improvement in activity in North America. Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2016, 2015 and 2014. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The following is a summary of the 2016 charges and credits, of which $3.172 billion were classified as Impairments & other and $648 million were classified as Merger & integration in the Consolidated Statement of Income : (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Net Workforce reductions $ 880 $ 69 $ 811 Fixed asset impairments 684 52 632 Inventory write-downs 616 49 567 Amortization of inventory fair value adjustment 299 90 209 Facility closure costs 226 53 173 North America pressure pumping asset impairments 209 67 142 Multiclient seismic data impairment 198 62 136 Facility impairments 165 58 107 Other merger and integration-related 160 28 132 Costs associated with exiting certain activities 98 23 75 Merger-related employee benefits 83 13 70 Currency devaluation loss in Egypt 63 - 63 Other restructuring charges 55 - 55 Professional fees 45 10 35 Contract termination costs 39 9 30 $ 3,820 $ 583 $ 3,237 The following is a summary of the 2015 charges and credits, all of which were classified as Impairments & other in the Consolidated Statement of Income : (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Net Workforce reductions $ 920 $ 107 $ 813 Fixed asset impairments 776 141 635 Inventory write-downs 269 27 242 Impairment of SPM project 182 36 146 Facility closures 177 37 140 Geopolitical events 77 - 77 Currency devaluation loss in Venezuela 49 - 49 Contract termination costs 41 2 39 Other 84 7 77 $ 2,575 $ 357 $ 2,218 20 The following is a summary of the 2014 charges and credits , all of which were classified as Impairments & other in the Consolidated Statement of Income : (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Net WesternGeco restructuring $ 806 $ 25 $ 781 Currency devaluation loss in Venezuela 472 - 472 Workforce reduction 296 37 259 Impairment of SPM project 199 72 127 $ 1,773 $ 134 $ 1,639 Liquidity and Capital Resources Schlumberger had total Cash , Short-term investments and Fixed income investments, held to maturity of $9.5 billion, $13.5 billion and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total debt was $19.6 billion, $19.0 billion and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay d ebt. Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, total debt. ( 2 ) Includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, multiclient seismic data costs and SPM investments. ( 3 ) Includes severance payments of approximately $850 million during 2016 and $810 million during 2015. ( 4 ) Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, SPM investments and multiclient seismic data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as substitute for, or superior to, cash flow from operations. ( 5 ) Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. Key liquidity events during 2016, 2015 and 2014 included: Cash flow from operations was $6.3 billion in 2016, $8.8 billion in 2015 and $11.2 billion in 2014. The decrease in operating cash flows in each of the last two years is largely attributable to lower earnings before non-cash charges and credits and depreciation and amortization expense. Schlumberger paid $2.8 billion of cash in connection with the April 1, 2016 acquisition of Cameron. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of Cameron, Schlumberger assumed $3.0 billion of debt (including a $244 million adjustment to increase Cameron long-term fixed rate debt to its estimated fair value) and $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. During the second quarter of 2016, Schlumberger repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of Cameron long-term fixed-rate debt. In connection with Schlumberger acquisition of Cameron, Cameron merged with Schlumberger Holdings Corporation (SHC), an indirect wholly-owned United States subsidiary of Schlumberger. Under the terms of the agreement, Cameron shareholders received 0.716 shares of Schlumberger Limited common stock and a cash payment of $14.44 in exchange for each Cameron share of common stock outstanding. In connection with this transaction, SHC acquired approximately 138 million shares of common stock from Schlumberger Limited and transferred those shares to Cameron shareholders. In order to partially fund the purchase of the 138 million shares of common stock from Schlumberger Limited that were transferred to Cameron stockholders, SHC issued $6 billion of notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 consisting of the following: $500 million of 1.90% Senior Notes due 2017; $1.3 billion of 2.35% Senior Notes due 2018; $1.6 billion of 3.00% Senior Notes due 2020; $850 million of 3.63% Senior Notes due 2022; and $1.75 billion of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025. On July 18, 2013, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018. Schlumberger had repurchased $9.4 billion of shares under this share repurchase program as of December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2016, 2015 and 2014: (Stated in thousands, except per share amounts) Total Cost Total Number Average Price of Shares of Shares Paid per Purchased Purchased Share 2016 $ 778,018 10,988.5 $ 70.80 2015 $ 2,182,180 26,751.0 $ 81.57 2014 $ 4,677,687 47,545.9 $ 98.38 22 On January 21, 2016, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock. This new program will take effect once the remaining $ 0.6 billion authorized to be repurchased under the July 18, 2013 program is exhausted. Dividends paid during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. On January 15, 2015, Schlumberger announced that the Board approved a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend, to $0.50 per share. Capital expenditures were $2.1 billion in 2016, $2.4 billion in 2015 and $4.0 billion in 2014. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2.2 billion in 2017. During 2016, 2015 and 2014 Schlumberger made contributions of $174 million, $346 million and $390 million, respectively, to its postretirement benefit plans. The US pension plans were 85% funded at December 31, 2016 and 86% funded at December 31, 2015 based on the projected benefit obligation. Schlumberger international defined benefit pension plans were a combined 92% funded at December 31, 2016 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 93% funded at December 31, 2015. Schlumberger expects to contribute approximately $200 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2017, subject to market and business conditions. In April 2016, Schlumberger announced that it would reduce its activity in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments received in recent quarters and a lack of progress in establishing new mechanisms that address past and future accounts receivable. Schlumberger continues to experience delays in payment from its national oil company customer in Venezuela. Venezuela represented less than 5% of Schlumberger consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Schlumberger net receivable balance in Venezuela as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $1.2 billion. Although accounts receivable collections improved during the fourth quarter of 2016, Schlumberger continues to experience payment delays from many of its customers. This is attributable to the impact of lower oil and gas prices on the industry. In this regard, Ecuador now represents approximately 12% of Schlumberger accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2016. Schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries. At December 31, 2016, only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger accounts receivable balances, of which only three (the United States, Ecuador and Venezuela) accounted for greater than 10%. Schlumberger maintains a 5.0 billion Guaranteed Euro Medium Term Note program. This program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in Euro, US dollar or other currencies. Schlumberger has issued 0.5 billion 1.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2019 under this program. As of December 31, 2016, Schlumberger had $9.3 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Schlumberger also has separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $6.6 billion with commercial banks, of which $4.0 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2016. The $6.6 billion of committed debt facility agreements included $6.3 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper programs. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months. The total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $2.571 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $2.383 billion as of December 31, 2015.

(3) Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust its requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 18, Pension and Other Benefit Plans, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in the Schlumberger Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 is approximately $1.4 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees that relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data Schlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.07 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value. The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, larger surveys (which are typically prefunded by customers) are analyzed for impairment on a survey-by-survey basis and smaller surveys are analyzed based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors, including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys, and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. 24 Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. The goodwill relating to each of Schlumberger reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, Schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if Schlumberger concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of a two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill, Schlumberger reporting units are its four Groups: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling, Production and Cameron. Schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2016. Based on this assessment, Schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further testing was required. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets, intangible assets and investments in SPM projects, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Income Taxes Schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Percentage-of-Completion Revenue Recognition Schlumberger uses the percentage-of-completion method to account for certain long-term construction-type contracts, primarily in the Cameron Group. These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications. Under the percentage-of-completion method, revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. The estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project. Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims. Profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete. Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses. Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable. 25 Approximately 6 % of Schlumberger revenue in 2 016 was recognized under the percentage-of-completion method. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate that Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan was 4.20% at December 31, 2016 and 4.50% at December 31, 2015. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger international pension plans was 4.13% at December 31, 2016 and 4.36% at December 31, 2015. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan decreased from 4.85% in 2015 to 4.15% in 2016. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger international pension plans increased from 4.07% in 2015 to 4.36% in 2016. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expected rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 7.25% in both 2016 and 2015. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 7.40% in both 2016 and 2015. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2016 postretirement medical expense was 7.50% graded to 5.0% over the next ten years. The overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at December 31, 2016 was 7.25% graded to 5.0% over the next ten years.
