Overview For a description of the Registrants and their businesses, see "Item 1. Business." Business Strategy (All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply) The strategy for the regulated businesses of WPD, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU is to provide efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintain constructive regulatory relationships and achieve timely recovery of costs. These regulated businesses also focus on providing competitively priced energy to customers and achieving stable, long-term growth in earnings and rate base, or RAV, as applicable. Both rate base and RAV are expected to grow for the foreseeable future as a result of significant capital expenditure programs to maintain existing assets and improving system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and KU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to electricity generation facilities. Future RAV for WPD will also be affected by RIIO-ED1, effective April 1, 2015, as the recovery period for assets placed in service after that date will be extended from 20 to 45 years. 38 Recovery of capital project costs is attained through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings, FERC formula rate mechanisms, and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on certain construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of prudently incurred costs. In Pennsylvania, the recently approved DSIC mechanism will help PPL Electric reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of distribution reliability-related capital investment. In addition, Pennsylvania has several other cost recovery mechanisms in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of prudently incurred costs. See "Financial and Operational Developments - Distribution System Improvement Charge" below for additional information on the implementation of the DSIC mechanism in 2013 and "Item 1. Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment - Revenues and Regulation" for changes to the regulatory framework in the U.K. applicable to WPD beginning in 2015. (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) The strategy for PPL Energy Supply is to optimize the value from its competitive generation asset and marketing portfolios while mitigating near-term volatility in both cash flows and earnings. PPL Energy Supply endeavors to do this by matching energy supply with load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying durations with creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing exposure to energy and fuel price volatility, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. PPL Energy Supply is focused on maintaining profitability during the current and projected period of low energy and capacity prices. See "Financial and Operational Developments - Economic and Market Conditions" below for additional information. (PPL) As a result of the acquisition of WPD Midlands in April 2011, PPL increased the proportion of its overall earnings that is subject to foreign currency translation risk. The U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent they have U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts. (All Registrants) To manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain targeted credit profiles and liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to, as applicable, changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of generating units. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. Financial and Operational Developments Earnings (PPL) PPL's earnings by reportable segment were as follows. % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 U.K. Regulated (a) $ 922 $ 803 $ 325 15 147 Kentucky Regulated 307 177 221 73 (20) Pennsylvania Regulated 209 132 173 58 (24) Supply (b) (272) 414 776 (166) (47) Corporate and Other (c) (36) n/a n/a Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners $ 1,130 $ 1,526 $ 1,495 (26) 2 EPS - basic $ 1.85 $ 2.61 $ 2.71 (29) (4) EPS - diluted (d) $ 1.76 $ 2.60 $ 2.70 (32) (4) (a) 2013 and 2012 include a full year of WPD Midlands' results, while 2011, the year WPD Midlands was acquired, includes eight months of its results and was also impacted by certain acquisition related costs. See Notes 7 and 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition and related financing. (b) 2013 includes a charge of $697 million ($413 million after-tax) for the termination of the operating lease of the Colstrip coal-fired electricity generating facility and an impairment charge of $65 million ($39 million after-tax) for the Corette coal-fired plant and related emission allowances. See Notes 8 and 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (c) Primarily represents financing and certain other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which are presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results. For 2012 and 2011, there were no significant amounts in this category. (d) See "Equity Units" below for information on the Equity Units' impact on the calculation of 2013 diluted EPS. 39 The following after-tax gains (losses), in total, which management considers special items, impacted PPL's reportable segments' results. See PPL's "Results of Operations - Segment Earnings" for details of these special items. 2013 2012 2011 U.K. Regulated $ 67 $ 107 $ (157) Kentucky Regulated 3 (16) Supply (531) 18 142 Total PPL $ (461) $ 109 $ (15) The changes in PPL's reportable segments results for 2013 compared with 2012, excluding the impact of special items, were due to the following factors (on an after-tax basis): Increase at the U.K. Regulated segment primarily due to higher electricity delivery revenues and lower U.K. income taxes, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation. Increase at the Kentucky Regulated segment primarily due to higher base rates that became effective January 1, 2013 and returns from additional environmental capital investments. Increase at the Pennsylvania Regulated segment primarily due to higher distribution base rates that became effective January 1, 2013, higher transmission margins from additional capital investments, lower operation and maintenance expense and higher distribution sales volume due to weather, partially offset by higher depreciation. Decrease at the Supply segment primarily due to lower baseload energy prices, higher depreciation and higher income taxes, partially offset by higher capacity prices, higher nuclear generation volume and lower operation and maintenance expense. The changes in PPL's reportable segments' results for 2012 compared with 2011, excluding the impact of special items, were due to the following factors (on an after-tax basis): Increase at the U.K. Regulated segment primarily due to four additional months of earnings from the WPD Midlands businesses, higher delivery revenue and lower U.K. income taxes, partially offset by higher U.S. income taxes, higher depreciation and a less favorable currency exchange rate. Decrease at the Kentucky Regulated segment primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation, higher property taxes and losses from an equity method investment, partially offset by lower income taxes. Decrease at the Pennsylvania Regulated segment primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expense, higher income and non-income taxes, lower distribution margins as a result of mild weather early in the year and higher depreciation, partially offset by higher transmission revenue and lower financing costs due to the redemption of $250 million of preferred securities. Decrease at the Supply segment primarily due to lower Eastern energy margins resulting from lower baseload energy and capacity prices, lower Western energy margins resulting from an early 2012 contract termination related to the bankruptcy of a large customer, higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation, higher income taxes and higher financing costs. See "Results of Operations" below for further discussion of PPL's reportable segments and analysis of results of operations. 2014 Outlook (PPL) Excluding special items, lower earnings are expected in 2014 compared with 2013. The factors underlying these projections by segment and Subsidiary Registrant are discussed below (on an after-tax basis). (PPL's U.K. Regulated Segment) Excluding special items, earnings in 2014 are projected to be comparable with 2013. Higher electricity delivery revenue and lower pension expense are expected to be offset by higher income taxes, higher depreciation and higher financing costs. 40 (PPL's Kentucky Regulated Segment and LKE, LG&E and KU) Excluding special items, lower earnings are projected in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily driven by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and higher financing costs, partially offset by returns on additional environmental capital investments and modest retail load growth. (PPL's Pennsylvania Regulated Segment and PPL Electric) Excluding special items, higher earnings are projected in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily driven by higher transmission margins and returns on distribution improvement capital spending, partially offset by higher financing costs and higher income taxes. (PPL's Supply Segment and PPL Energy Supply) Excluding special items, lower earnings are projected in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily driven by lower energy and capacity prices, partially offset by lower financing costs and lower income taxes. (All Registrants) Earnings in future periods are subject to various risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 1A. Risk Factors," the rest of this Item 7, and Notes 1, 6 and 15 to the Financial Statements (as applicable) for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings. Other Financial and Operational Developments Economic and Market Conditions ( PPL and PPL Energy Supply) Continued depressed wholesale market prices for electricity and natural gas have resulted from general weak economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of expanded domestic shale gas development and additional renewable energy sources, primarily wind in the western U.S. Unregulated Gross Energy Margins associated with PPL Energy Supply's competitive generation and marketing business are impacted by changes in energy and capacity market prices and demand for electricity and natural gas, power plant availability, competition in the markets for retail customers, fuel costs and availability, transmission constraints that impact the locational pricing of electricity at PPL Energy Supply's power plants, fuel transportation costs and the level and price of hedging activities. As a result of these factors, energy margins were lower in 2013 compared to 2012 and future energy margins are expected to be lower compared to 2013 energy margins. See "Changes in Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Unregulated Gross Energy Margins in Statement of Income Analysis" below for additional information on energy margins for 2011 through 2013. As has been PPL Energy Supply's practice in periods of changing business conditions, PPL Energy Supply continues to review its future business and operational plans, including capital and operation and maintenance expenditures, its hedging strategies and potential plant modifications to burn lower cost fuels. ( All Registrants except PPL Electric) The businesses of PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to coal combustion residuals, GHG, effluent limitation guidelines and MATS. See "Financial Condition - Environmental Matters" below for additional information on these requirements. These and other stringent environmental requirements, combined with low energy margins for competitive generation, have led several energy companies, including PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU, to announce plans to either temporarily or permanently close, or place in long-term reserve status, certain of their coal-fired generating plants. ( PPL and PPL Energy Supply) In the third quarter of 2012, PPL Energy Supply announced its intention, beginning in April 2015, to place its Corette plant in long-term reserve status, suspending the plant's operation due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with MATS. During the fourth quarter of 2013, PPL Energy Supply determined its Corette plant was impaired and PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $65 million, or $39 million after-tax. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)" for additional information. 41 In September 2013, PPL Montana executed a definitive agreement to sell to NorthWestern 633 MW of hydroelectric generation facilities located in Montana for $900 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The sale is subject to closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals by the FERC and the Montana Public Service Commission and certain third-party consents. The sale is not expected to close before the second half of 2014. To facilitate the sale, on December 20, 2013, PPL Montana terminated its operating lease arrangement related to partial interests in Units 1, 2 and 3 of the Colstrip coal-fired electricity generating facility and acquired those interests, collectively, for $271 million. As a result, PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $697 million, or $413 million after-tax, for the lease termination. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. PPL Energy Supply believes its remaining competitive coal-fired generation assets in Pennsylvania are well positioned to meet the current environmental requirements described above based on prior and planned investments. The current depressed levels of energy and capacity prices in PJM, as well as management's forward view of these prices using its fundamental pricing models recently updated in conjunction with the annual business planning process, continue to put pressure on the recoverability of PPL Energy Supply's investment in its Pennsylvania coal-fired generation assets. In the fourth quarter of 2013, management tested the Brunner Island and Montour plants for impairment and concluded neither plant was impaired as of December 31, 2013. The recoverability test is very sensitive to forward energy and capacity price assumptions, as well as forecasted operation and maintenance and capital spending. Therefore, a further decline in forecasted long-term energy or capacity prices or changes in environmental laws requiring additional capital or operation and maintenance expenditures, could negatively impact PPL Energy Supply's operations of these facilities and potentially result in future impairment charges for some or all of the carrying value of these plants. The carrying value of the Pennsylvania coal-fired generation assets tested was $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 ($1.4 billion for Brunner Island and $1.3 billion for Montour). ( PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) As a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, LKE projects $2.2 billion ($1.1 billion each at LG&E and KU) in capital investment over the next five years and the anticipated retirement by 2015 of five coal-fired units (three at LG&E and two at KU) with a combined summer capacity rating of 724 MW (563 MW at LG&E and 161 MW at KU). KU retired the 71 MW unit at the Tyrone plant in February 2013 and a 12 MW unit at the Haefling plant in December 2013. The retirement of these coal-fired units is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the anticipated retirement of these units as well as plans to build two combined-cycle natural gas facilities in Kentucky. The KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on certain construction work-in-progress) that provide for timely recovery of prudently incurred costs (including costs associated with environmental requirements). The Kentucky utility businesses are impacted by changes in customer usage levels, which can be driven by a number of factors including weather conditions and economic factors that impact the load utilized by customers. ( All Registrants) The Registrants cannot predict the impact that future economic and market conditions and regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations. ( PPL) Ofgem Review of Line Loss Calculation Ofgem is currently consulting on the methodology to be used by all network operators to calculate the final line loss incentives and penalties for the DPCR4, which ended in March 2010. During 2013, WPD recorded increases of $45 million to the liability with reductions to "Utility" revenue on the Statement of Income. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this matter. Based on information received from Ofgem in 2013, WPD currently estimates the potential loss exposure for this matter to be between $74 million and $213 million. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Distribution Revenue Reduction In December 2013, WPD and other U.K. DNOs, announced agreements with the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change and Ofgem to a reduction of 5 per residential customer of electricity distribution revenues that otherwise would have been collected in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2014. Full recovery of the revenue reduction, together with the associated carrying cost, will occur during the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2015 for three of the WPD DNOs, and will occur over the eight year RIIO-ED1 regulatory period for the fourth DNO. PPL projects that, as a result of this change, 2014 earnings for its U.K. Regulated segment will be adversely affected by $29 million and earnings for 2015 and 2016 will be positively affected by $7 million and $12 million. RIIO-ED1 - Fast Tracking In July 2013, WPD filed with Ofgem its 8-year business plans for its four DNOs for RIIO-ED1. In November 2013, Ofgem determined that the business plans of all four of WPD's DNOs were suitable for accelerated consideration or "fast tracking". Fast tracking affords several benefits to the WPD DNOs including the ability to collect additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of total annual expenditures during the 8-year price control period, or approximately $35 million annually, greater revenue certainty and a higher level of cost savings retention. In February 2014, Ofgem announced its decision on the consultation related to the cost of equity to be used during the RIIO-ED1 period. The resulting real cost of equity for WPD was 6.4%, compared to 6.7% proposed in WPD's business plan submittals. WPD elected to accept this change and remain in the fast-track process. The change in the cost of equity is not expected to have a significant impact on the results of operations for PPL. Ofgem expects to announce its fast track final determination in late February 2014. See "Item 1. Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment" for additional information. Equity Forward Agreements In the second quarter of 2013, PPL settled forward sale agreements for 10.5 million shares of PPL common stock by issuing 8.4 million shares and cash settling the remaining 2.1 million shares. PPL received net cash proceeds of $201 million, which was used to repay short-term debt obligations and for other general corporate purposes. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Prior to settlement, incremental shares were included within the calculation of diluted EPS using the treasury stock method. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for the impact on the calculation of diluted EPS. Equity Units During 2013, several events occurred related to the 2010 Equity Units. During the second quarter of 2013, PPL Capital Funding remarketed the Junior Subordinated Notes and simultaneously exchanged the remarketed notes for three tranches of Senior Notes. The transaction resulted in a $10 million loss on extinguishment of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Additionally, in July 2013, PPL issued 40 million shares of common stock at $28.73 per share to settle the 2010 Purchase Contracts. PPL received net cash proceeds of $1.150 billion, which were used to repay short-term and long-term debt obligations and for other general corporate purposes. In 2013, the If-Converted Method of calculating diluted EPS was applied to the Equity Units prior to settlement. This resulted in $44 million of interest charges (after-tax) being added back to income available to PPL common shareowners, and 53 million weighted-average incremental shares of PPL common stock being treated as outstanding for purposes of the diluted EPS calculation. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements for the impact on the calculation of diluted EPS. During 2014, two events are anticipated related to the 2011 Equity Units. PPL will receive proceeds of $978 million through the issuance of PPL common stock to settle the 2011 Purchase Contracts and PPL Capital Funding expects to remarket the 4.32% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2019. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Tax Litigation In May 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the December 2011 ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, on the creditability for U.S. income tax purposes of the U.K. Windfall Profits Tax paid by a U.K. subsidiary of PPL. As a result of this decision, PPL recorded an income tax benefit of $44 million in 2013. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 43 U.K. Tax Rate Change In July 2013, the U.K. Finance Act 2013 was enacted, which reduces the U.K.'s statutory income tax rate from 23% to 21%, effective April 1, 2014 and from 21% to 20%, effective April 1, 2015. As a result of these changes, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit of $97 million during 2013. Susquehanna Turbine Blade Inspection (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) In the spring of 2013, PPL Susquehanna made modifications to address the causes of turbine blade cracking at the PPL Susquehanna nuclear plant that was first identified in 2011. The modifications were made during the Unit 2 refueling outage and an additional planned outage for Unit 1. In September 2013, data from extensive vibration monitoring equipment installed on the turbine blades identified cracks in a small number of the blades on both units. Unit 2 completed a blade inspection and replacement outage on September 23, 2013. Based upon the evaluation of the conditions on Unit 1 and the latest inspection of previously removed blades, PPL Susquehanna will continue to operate Unit 1 and monitor the blades through the vibration monitoring equipment. The financial impact of the Unit 2 outage was not material. PPL Susquehanna continues to work with the turbine manufacturer to identify and resolve the issues causing the blade cracking. Distribution System Improvement Charge ( PPL and PPL Electric) Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms - the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery. In May 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric's proposed DSIC, with an initial rate effective July 1, 2013, subject to refund after hearings. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Rate Case Proceedings ( PPL and PPL Electric) In December 2012, the PUC approved a total distribution revenue increase of about $71 million for PPL Electric, using a 10.4% return on equity. The approved rates became effective January 1, 2013. (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) In December 2012, the KPSC approved a rate case settlement agreement providing for increases in annual base electricity rates of $34 million for LG&E and $51 million for KU and an increase in annual base gas rates of $15 million for LG&E and authorizes a 10.25% return on equity. The approved rates became effective January 1, 2013. (KU) In November 2013, the VSCC approved a stipulation providing for increases in annual base electricity rates of $4.7 million. The approved rates became effective December 1, 2013. The order does not formally establish a return on equity, but authorizes use of a 10% return on equity for certain annual rate filing purposes. FERC Formula Rates (KU) In September 2013, KU filed an application with the FERC to adjust the formula rate under which KU provides wholesale requirements power sales to 12 municipal customers. Among other changes, the application requests an amended formula whereby KU would charge cost-based rates with a subsequent true-up to actual costs, replacing the current formula which does not include a true-up. KU's application proposed an authorized return on equity of 10.7%. Subject to regulatory approval, the new formula rate may become effective during the second quarter of 2014. Results of Operations (PPL) The discussion for PPL provides a review of results by reportable segment. The "Margins" discussion provides explanations of non-GAAP financial measures (Kentucky Gross Margins, Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins and Unregulated Gross Energy Margins) and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to "Operating Income." The "Statement of Income Analysis" discussion addresses significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes. "Segment Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis" is presented separately for PPL. 44 On April 1, 2011, PPL completed its acquisition of WPD Midlands. WPD Midlands' results are included within "Segment Results - U.K. Regulated Segment." As PPL is consolidating WPD Midlands on a one-month lag, consistent with its accounting policy on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries, a full year of WPD Midlands' results of operations are included in PPL's results for 2013 and 2012, and eight months of WPD Midlands' results of operations are included in PPL's results for 2011. When discussing PPL's results of operations for 2013 compared with 2012, the results of WPD Midlands are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. For 2012 compared with 2011, WPD Midlands results have been isolated for purposes of comparability. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition. Tables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within "Segment Earnings" and "Statement of Income Analysis" are presented on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained. Results computed on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis are calculated by translating current year results at the prior year weighted-average U.K. foreign currency exchange rate. (Subsidiary Registrants) The discussion for each of PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU provides a summary of earnings. The "Margins" discussion includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to "Operating Income" and "Statement of Income Analysis" addresses significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income comparing year-to-year changes. "Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis" are presented separately for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. PPL Segment Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis Segment Earnings U.K. Regulated Segment The U.K. Regulated segment consists of PPL Global which primarily includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs, WPD Midlands acquisition-related costs and allocated financing costs. The U.K. Regulated segment represents 82% of Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners for 2013 and 34% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2013. Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners includes the following results (PPL WW and WPD Midlands on a consolidated basis, except for 2012 and 2011 acquisition-related adjustments, which are shown separately): % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Utility revenues (a) $ 2,359 $ 2,289 $ 1,618 3 41 Energy-related businesses 44 47 35 (6) 34 Total operating revenues 2,403 2,336 1,653 3 41 Other operation and maintenance 470 439 374 7 17 Depreciation 300 279 211 8 32 Taxes, other than income 147 147 113 30 Energy-related businesses 29 34 17 (15) 100 Total operating expenses 946 899 715 5 26 Other Income (Expense) - net (39) (51) 13 (24) (492) Interest Expense 425 421 336 1 25 Income Taxes 71 153 98 (54) 56 WPD Midlands acquisition-related adjustments, net of tax (9) (192) (100) (95) Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners (b) $ 922 $ 803 $ 325 15 147 (a) 2011 includes $790 million for WPD Midlands. (b) 2011 includes $137 million for WPD Midlands, net of acquisition-related adjustments. The changes in the results of the U.K. Regulated segment between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect certain items that management considers special. WPD Midlands' results for 2012 compared with 2011 and effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates are on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. See below for additional detail of these special items. 45 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 U.K. Utility revenues $ 240 $ 49 Other operation and maintenance (40) (26) Depreciation (25) (8) Interest expense (10) 16 Other 1 (4) Income taxes 17 WPD Midlands, after-tax 224 U.S. Interest expense and other (1) (15) Income taxes 1 (25) Foreign currency exchange, after-tax (7) (14) Special items, after-tax (40) 264 Total $ 119 $ 478 U.K. The increase in utility revenues in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the impact of the April 1, 2013 and 2012 price increases. The increase in utility revenues in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the impact of the April 1, 2012 and 2011 price increases which resulted in $78 million of higher utility revenues, partially offset by $13 million of lower volumes due primarily to a downturn in the economy and weather. The increase in other operation and maintenance for 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to higher network maintenance costs. The increase in other operation and maintenance in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to higher pension expense resulting from an increase in amortization of actuarial losses. The increase in depreciation expense for both periods was primarily due to PP&E additions. The increase in interest expense in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to debt issuances in April 2012 and October 2013. The decrease in interest expense in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to lower interest expense on index-linked notes. Income taxes for 2013 compared with 2012 were flat despite higher pre-tax income primarily due to lower U.K. tax rates. The decrease in income taxes in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the tax deductibility of interest on acquisition financing of $12 million and a $9 million benefit relating to customer contributions for capital expenditures. WPD Midlands (2012 vs. 2011) Earnings in 2012 compared with 2011 were affected by an additional four months of results in 2012 totaling $171 million, after-tax. The comparable eight-month period was affected by higher utility revenue of $125 million resulting from the April 1, 2012 price increase and $26 million of lower pension expense, partially offset by $26 million of higher taxes due to higher pre-tax income, $25 million of additional interest expense on debt issuances in 2011 and 2012 and $25 million of higher taxes due to a U.K./U.S. intercompany tax transaction. U.S. The increase in interest expense and other in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the 2011 Equity Units issued to finance the WPD Midlands acquisition. 46 The decrease in income taxes for 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to a $42 million adjustment related to a ruling obtained from the IRS regarding 2010 U.K. earnings and profits calculations, partially offset by a $27 million increase attributable to a revision in the expected taxable amount of cash repatriation in 2013. The increase in income taxes in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to $28 million of tax benefits recorded in 2011 as a result of U.K. pension plan contributions and a $20 million adjustment primarily related to the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits, partially offset by $25 million from a U.K./U.S. intercompany tax transaction. The following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, also impacted the U.K. Regulated segment's results. Income Statement Line Item 2013 2012 2011 Other Income Foreign currency-related economic hedges, net of tax of $15, $18, ($2) (a) (Expense) - net $ (29) $ (33) $ 5 WPD Midlands acquisition-related adjustments: 2011 Bridge Facility costs, net of tax of $0, $0, $14 (b) Interest Expense (30) Other Income Foreign currency loss on 2011 Bridge Facility, net of tax of $0, $0, $19 (c) (Expense) - net (38) Other Income Net hedge gains, net of tax of $0, $0, ($17) (c) (Expense) - net 38 Hedge ineffectiveness, net of tax of $0, $0, $3 (d) Interest Expense (9) Other Income U.K. stamp duty tax, net of tax of $0, $0, $0 (e) (Expense) - net (21) Other operation Separation benefits, net of tax of $1, $4, $26 (f) and maintenance (4) (11) (75) Other acquisition-related adjustments, net of tax of ($2), ($1), $20 (g) 8 2 (57) Other: Change in U.K. tax rate (h) Income Taxes 84 75 69 Windfall tax litigation (i) Income Taxes 43 (39) Change in WPD line loss accrual, net of tax of $10, ($23), $0 (j) Utility (35) 74 Total $ 67 $ 107 $ (157) (a) Represents unrealized gains (losses) on contracts that economically hedge anticipated GBP-denominated earnings. (b) Represents fees incurred to establish the 2011 Bridge Facility. (c) Represents the foreign currency loss on repayment of the 2011 Bridge Facility, including a pre-tax foreign currency loss of $15 million associated with proceeds received on the U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes issued by PPL WEM in April 2011 that were used to repay a portion of PPL WEM's borrowing under the 2011 Bridge Facility. The foreign currency risk was economically hedged with forward contracts to purchase GBP, which resulted in pre-tax gains of $55 million. (d) Represents a combination of ineffectiveness associated with terminated interest rate swaps and a charge recorded as a result of certain interest rate swaps failing hedge effectiveness testing. (e) Tax on the transfer of ownership of property in the U.K., which is not tax deductible for income tax purposes. (f) 2012 represents severance compensation and early retirement deficiency costs. 2011 primarily represents severance compensation, early retirement deficiency costs and outplacement services for employees separating from the WPD Midlands companies as a result of a reorganization to transition the WPD Midlands companies to the same operating structure as WPD (South West) and WPD (South Wales). 2011 also includes severance compensation and early retirement deficiency costs associated with certain employees who separated from the WPD Midlands companies, but were not part of the reorganization. (g) 2011 primarily includes $34 million, pre-tax, of advisory, accounting and legal fees which are recorded in "Other Income (Expense) - net" on the Statement of Income; $37 million, pre-tax, of costs, primarily related to the termination of certain contracts, rebranding and relocation costs that were recorded to "Other operation and maintenance" expense on the Statement of Income; and $6 million, pre-tax, of costs associated with the integration of certain information technology assets, that were recorded in "Depreciation" on the Statement of Income. (h) The U.K. Finance Act of 2013, enacted in July 2013, reduced the U.K.'s statutory income tax rate from 23% to 21%, effective April 1, 2014 and from 21% to 20%, effective April 1, 2015. The U.K. Finance Act of 2012, enacted in July 2012, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 25% to 24% retroactive to April 1, 2012 and from 24% to 23% effective April 1, 2013. The U.K. Finance Act of 2011, enacted in July 2011, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 27% to 26% retroactive to April 1, 2011 and reduced the rate from 26% to 25% effective April 1, 2012. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liability and recognized a deferred tax benefit in 2013, 2012 and 2011. (i) In 2010, the U.S. Tax Court ruled in PPL's favor in a pending dispute with the IRS concluding that the 1997 U.K. Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) imposed on all U.K. privatized utilities, including PPL's U.K. subsidiary, is a creditable tax for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. In January 2011, the IRS appealed the U.S. Tax Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Third Circuit). In December 2011, the Third Circuit issued its opinion reversing the Tax Court's decision and holding that the WPT is not a creditable tax. As a result of the Third Circuit's adverse determination, PPL recorded a $39 million expense in 2011. In May 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit's December 2011 ruling. As a result, PPL recorded a $43 million income tax benefit during 2013. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (j) In November 2012, Ofgem issued additional consultation on the final DPCR4 line loss close-out that published values for each DNO and further indicated the preferred methodology that would replace the methodology under WPD's licenses, and also indicated that the line loss incentive implemented at the last rate review will be withdrawn and no incentive will apply for the DPCR5 period. Based on this, WPD Midlands reduced its line loss liability by $97 million, pre-tax in 2012. In 2013, WPD Midlands increased its line loss accrual by $45 million pre-tax based on additional information provided by Ofgem regarding the calculation. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 47 Kentucky Regulated Segment The Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE's regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. In addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. The Kentucky Regulated segment represents 27% of Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners for 2013 and 26% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2013. Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners includes the following results: % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Utility revenues $ 2,976 $ 2,759 $ 2,793 8 (1) Fuel 896 872 866 3 1 Energy purchases 217 195 238 11 (18) Other operation and maintenance 778 778 751 4 Depreciation 334 346 334 (3) 4 Taxes, other than income 48 46 37 4 24 Total operating expenses 2,273 2,237 2,226 2 Other Income (Expense) - net (7) (15) (1) (53) 1,400 Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 25 (100) n/a Interest Expense 212 219 217 (3) 1 Income Taxes 179 80 127 124 (37) Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) 2 (6) (1) (133) 500 Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners $ 307 $ 177 $ 221 73 (20) The changes in the results of the Kentucky Regulated segment between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Kentucky Gross Margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. See below for additional detail of the special items. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Kentucky Gross Margins $ 220 $ (8) Other operation and maintenance (5) (16) Depreciation (34) (10) Taxes, other than income (1) (9) Other Income (Expense) - net 7 (14) Interest Expense 7 (2) Income Taxes (83) 31 Special items, after-tax 19 (16) Total $ 130 $ (44) See "Margins - Changes in Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for an explanation of Kentucky Gross Margins. Higher other operation and maintenance in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to $11 million of expenses related to an increased scope of scheduled outages and a $6 million credit to establish a regulatory asset recorded when approved in 2011 related to 2009 storm costs. Higher depreciation in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to environmental costs related to the 2005 and 2006 ECR plans now being included in base rates. As a result, $51 million of depreciation associated with those environmental projects is shown as depreciation in 2013. Depreciation for these ECR plans was included in Kentucky Gross Margins in 2012 and 2011. This increase was partially offset by lower depreciation due to revised rates that were effective January 1, 2013. Both events are the result of the 2012 rate case proceedings. Higher depreciation in 2012 compared with 2011 due to additions to PP&E. Lower other income (expense) - net in 2012 compared with 2013 and 2011 primarily due to losses from the EEI investment recorded in 2012. The EEI investment was fully impaired in the fourth quarter of 2012. Higher income taxes in 2013 compared with 2012 and lower income taxes in 2012 compared with 2011 are primarily due to the change in pre-tax income. The following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, also impacted the Kentucky Regulated segment's results. 48 Income Statement Line Item 2013 2012 2011 Adjusted energy-related economic activity, net, net of tax of $0, $0, $(1) (a) Utility Revenues $ 1 Impairments: Other asset impairments, net of tax of $0, $10, $0 (b) Other-Than-Temporary-Impairments $ (15) LKE acquisition-related adjustments: Income Taxes and Other operation Net operating loss carryforward and other tax-related adjustments and maintenance 4 Other: LKE discontinued operations (c) Discontinued Operations $ 2 (5) (1) EEI adjustments, net of tax of $0, $0, $0 (d) Other Income (Expense) - net 1 Total $ 3 $ (16) $ (a) Recorded by LG&E and is reflected in "Operating Revenues" for LKE and in "Retail and wholesale" for LG&E on the Statements of Income. (b) KU recorded an impairment of its equity method investment in EEI. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (c) 2012 includes an adjustment recorded by LKE to an indemnification liability. (d) Recorded by KU. Pennsylvania Regulated Segment The Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric. In addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment represents 18% of Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners for 2013 and 15% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2013. Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners includes the following results: % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Operating revenues External $ 1,866 $ 1,760 $ 1,881 6 (6) Intersegment 4 3 11 33 (73) Total operating revenues 1,870 1,763 1,892 6 (7) Energy purchases External 588 550 738 7 (25) Intersegment 51 78 26 (35) 200 Other operation and maintenance 531 576 530 (8) 9 Depreciation 178 160 146 11 10 Taxes, other than income 103 105 104 (2) 1 Total operating expenses 1,451 1,469 1,544 (1) (5) Other Income (Expense) - net 6 9 7 (33) 29 Interest Expense 108 99 98 9 1 Income Taxes 108 68 68 59 - Net Income 209 136 189 54 (28) Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests (Note 3) 4 16 (100) (75) Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners $ 209 $ 132 $ 173 58 (24) The changes in the components of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins on a separate line and not on their respective Statement of Income line items. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins $ 114 $ 19 Other operation and maintenance 23 (50) Depreciation (18) (14) Taxes, other than income 5 (9) Other Income (Expense) - net (3) 2 Interest Expense (9) (1) Income Taxes (39) Noncontrolling Interests 4 12 Total $ 77 $ (41) 49 See "Margins - Changes in Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for an explanation of Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins. Lower other operation and maintenance for 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to lower storm costs of $17 million and lower support group costs of $19 million, partially offset by $14 million increased vegetation management costs. Higher other operation and maintenance for 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to $17 million in higher payroll-related costs due to less project costs being capitalized in 2012, higher support group costs of $11 million and $10 million for increased vegetation management costs. Higher depreciation for both periods primarily due to PP&E additions related to the ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability of the delivery system and replace aging infrastructure. Income taxes were higher in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher pre-tax income which increased income taxes by $47 million, partially offset by $8 million of income tax return adjustments primarily recorded in 2012, largely related to changes in flow-through regulated tax depreciation. Income taxes were flat in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower pre-tax income which decreased income taxes by $22 million, primarily offset by $9 million of depreciation not normalized and $11 million of income tax return adjustments, largely related to changes in flow-through regulated tax depreciation. Lower noncontrolling interests for both periods due to PPL Electric's redemption of preference securities in June 2012. Supply Segment The Supply segment consists primarily of PPL Energy Supply's wholesale, retail, marketing and trading activities, as well as the competitive generation operations. In addition, certain financing and other costs are allocated to the Supply segment. The Supply segment represents negative 24% of Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners for 2013 and 25% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2013. In 2011, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries completed the sale of several businesses, which have been classified as Discontinued Operations. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners includes the following results. % Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Energy revenues External (a) $ 4,075 $ 4,970 $ 5,938 (18) (16) Intersegment 51 79 26 (35) 204 Energy-related businesses 527 461 472 14 (2) Total operating revenues 4,653 5,510 6,436 (16) (14) Fuel (a) 1,049 965 1,080 9 (11) Energy Purchases External (a) 1,168 1,810 2,277 (35) (21) Intersegment 3 2 4 50 (50) Other operation and maintenance (b) 1,072 1,058 899 1 18 Loss on lease termination (c) 697 n/a n/a Depreciation 318 289 245 10 18 Taxes, other than income 66 68 72 (3) (6) Energy-related businesses 512 450 467 14 (4) Total operating expenses 4,885 4,642 5,044 5 (8) Other Income (Expense) - net 33 18 43 83 (58) Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 1 2 6 (50) (67) Interest Expense 228 222 192 3 16 Income Taxes (157) 247 463 (164) (47) Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations 3 n/a (100) Net Income (271) 415 777 (165) (47) Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 1 1 1 Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners $ (272) $ 414 $ 776 (166) (47) (a) Includes the impact from energy-related economic activity. See "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading) - Economic Activity" in Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (b) 2013 includes an impairment charge of $65 million ($39 million after-tax) for the Corette coal-fired plant and related emission allowances. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (c) See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 50 The changes in the components of the Supply segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Unregulated Gross Energy Margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. See below for additional detail of the special items. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Unregulated Gross Energy Margins $ (194) $ (197) Other operation and maintenance 40 (100) Depreciation (29) (44) Taxes, other than income 5 8 Other Income (Expense) - net 19 (26) Interest Expense (6) (20) Other (5) 5 Income Taxes 33 136 Special items, after-tax (549) (124) Total $ (686) $ (362) See "Margins - Changes in Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for an explanation of Unregulated Gross Energy Margins. Lower other operation and maintenance in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower fossil and hydroelectric costs of $17 million, largely driven by lower outage costs in 2013 and lower pension expense of $11 million. Higher other operation and maintenance in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to higher costs at PPL Susquehanna of $33 million, $20 million due to the Ironwood Acquisition, $7 million of higher fossil and hydroelectric unit costs and $11 million of higher pension expense. Higher depreciation in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to PP&E additions. Higher depreciation in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a $24 million impact from PP&E additions and $17 million due to the Ironwood Acquisition. Higher other income (expense) - net in 2013 compared with 2012, however no individual item was significant in comparison to the prior year. Lower other income (expense) - net in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a $22 million gain on the July 2011 debt redemption. Higher interest expense in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to hedging activity, which increased interest expense by $30 million, and $12 million related to the debt assumed as a result of the Ironwood Acquisition, partially offset by $11 million of lower interest on short-term borrowings. Lower income taxes in 2013 compared with 2012 due to lower pre-tax income, which reduced income taxes by $62 million, and $10 million related to the impact of prior period tax return adjustments, partially offset by $38 million of higher taxes due to state tax rate changes. Lower income taxes in 2012 compared with 2011 due to lower pre-tax income, which reduced income taxes by $151 million, and $23 million related to lower adjustments to valuation allowances on Pennsylvania net operating losses, partially offset by $21 million related to the impact of prior period tax return adjustments. The following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, also impacted the Supply segment's results. 51 Income Statement Line Item 2013 2012 2011 Adjusted energy-related economic activity - net, net of tax of $54, ($26), ($52) (a) $ (77) $ 38 $ 72 Impairments: Other operation and Emission allowances, net of tax of $0, $0, $1 maintenance (1) Other operation and RECs, net of tax of $0, $0, $2 maintenance (3) Other Income Adjustments - nuclear decommissioning trust investments, net of tax of $0, ($2), $0 (Expense) - net 2 Other operation and Other asset impairments, net of tax of $0, $0, $0 maintenance (1) Other operation and Corette asset impairment, net of tax of $26, $0, $0 (b) maintenance (39) LKE acquisition-related adjustments: Sale of certain non-core generation facilities, net of tax of $0, $0, $0 Discontinued Operations (2) Other: Montana hydroelectric litigation, net of tax of $0, $0, ($30) (c) 45 Litigation settlement - spent nuclear fuel storage, net of tax of $0, $0, ($24) (d) Fuel 33 Change in tax accounting method related to repairs Income Taxes (3) Other operation and Counterparty bankruptcy, net of tax of ($1), $5, $5 (e) maintenance 1 (6) (6) Unregulated wholesale Wholesale supply cost reimbursement, net of tax of $0, $0, ($3) (f) energy 1 4 Other operation and Ash basin leak remediation adjustment, net of tax of $0, ($1), $0 maintenance 1 Coal contract modification payments, net of tax of $0, $12, $0 (g) Fuel (17) Loss on Colstrip operating lease termination, net of tax of $284, $0, $0 (h) Loss on lease termination (413) Total $ (531) $ 18 $ 142 (a) See "Reconciliation of Economic Activity" below. (b) In 2012, PPL Energy Supply announced its intention, beginning in April 2015, to place its Corette coal-fired plant in Montana in long-term reserve status, suspending the plant's operation due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with MATS. During the fourth quarter of 2013, PPL Energy Supply determined its Corette plant was impaired and recorded a pre-tax charge of $65 million for the plant and related emission allowances. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (c) In February 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Montana state court decisions requiring PPL Montana to make lease payments for the use of certain Montana streambeds. As a result, in 2011, PPL Montana reversed its total loss accrual. The amount related to periods prior to 2011 was considered a special item, which consisted of a $65 million net credit to "Other operation and maintenance" and a $10 million net credit to "Interest Expense" on the Statement of Income in 2011. (d) In May 2011, PPL Susquehanna entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOE relating to PPL Susquehanna's lawsuit, seeking damages for the Department of Energy's failure to accept spent nuclear fuel from the PPL Susquehanna plant. PPL Susquehanna recorded credits to fuel expense to recognize recovery, under the settlement agreement, of certain costs to store spent nuclear fuel at the Susquehanna plant. This special item represents amounts recorded in 2011 to cover the costs incurred from 1998 through December 2010. (e) In October 2011, a wholesale customer, SMGT, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code. In 2012, PPL EnergyPlus recorded an additional allowance for unpaid amounts under the long-term power contract. In March 2012, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana approved the request to terminate the contract, effective April 1, 2012. In June 2013, PPL EnergyPlus received an approval for an administrative claim in the amount of $2 million. (f) In January 2012, PPL received $7 million pre-tax, related to electricity delivered to a wholesale customer in 2008 and 2009. The additional revenue results from several transmission projects approved at PJM for recovery that were not initially anticipated at the time of the electricity auctions and therefore were not included in the auction pricing. A FERC order was issued in 2011 approving the disbursement of these supply costs by the wholesale customer to the suppliers; therefore, PPL accrued its share of this additional revenue in 2011. (g) As a result of lower electricity and natural gas prices, coal-fired generation output decreased during 2012. Contract modification payments were incurred to reduce 2012 and 2013 coal deliveries. (h) In September 2013, PPL Montana executed a definitive agreement to sell to NorthWestern certain hydroelectric generating facilities located in Montana. To facilitate the sale of the hydroelectric facilities, on December 20, 2013, PPL Montana terminated its operating lease arrangement related to partial interests in Units 1, 2 and 3 of the Colstrip coal-fired electric generating facility and acquired those interests, collectively, for $271 million. At lease termination, the existing lease-related assets on the balance sheet were written-off and the acquired Colstrip assets were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $697 million ($413 million after-tax) for the termination of the lease. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Reconciliation of Economic Activity The following table reconciles unrealized pre-tax gains (losses) from the table within "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading) - Economic Activity" in Note 19 to the Financial Statements to the special item identified as "Adjusted energy-related economic activity, net." 52 2013 2012 2011 Operating Revenues Unregulated wholesale energy $ (721) $ (311) $ 1,407 Unregulated retail energy 12 (17) 31 Operating Expenses Fuel (4) (14) 6 Energy Purchases 586 442 (1,123) Energy-related economic activity (a) (127) 100 321 Option premiums (b) (4) (1) 19 Adjusted energy-related economic activity (131) 99 340 Less: Economic activity realized, associated with the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts in 2010 35 216 Adjusted energy-related economic activity, net, pre-tax $ (131) $ 64 $ 124 Adjusted energy-related economic activity, net, after-tax $ (77) $ 38 $ 72 (a) See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (b) Adjustment for the net deferral and amortization of option premiums over the delivery period of the item that was hedged or upon realization. Option premiums are recorded in "Unregulated wholesale energy" and "Energy purchases" on the Statements of Income. Margins Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management utilizes the following non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses. "Kentucky Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the Kentucky Regulated segment's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations as well as LKE's and LG&E's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded as "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded as "Other operation and maintenance" and "Depreciation" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the electricity and gas operations. "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's and PPL Electric's electricity delivery operations, which includes transmission and distribution activities. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "Energy purchases," "Other operation and maintenance," which is primarily Act 129 costs, and "Taxes, other than income," which is primarily gross receipts tax. This performance measure includes PLR energy purchases by PPL Electric from PPL EnergyPlus, which are reflected in "PLR intersegment utility revenue (expense)" in the reconciliation table below (in "Energy purchases from affiliate" in PPL Electric's reconciliation table). As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's and PPL Electric's electricity delivery operations. "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the Supply segment's and PPL Energy Supply's competitive energy activities, which are managed on a geographic basis. In calculating this measure, energy revenues, including operating revenues associated with certain businesses classified as discontinued operations, are offset by the cost of fuel, energy purchases, certain other operation and maintenance expenses, primarily ancillary charges, gross receipts tax, recorded in "Taxes, other than income," and operating expenses associated with certain businesses classified as discontinued operations. This performance measure is relevant due to the volatility in the individual revenue and expense lines on the Statements of Income that comprise "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins." This volatility stems from a number of factors, including the required netting of certain transactions with ISOs and significant fluctuations in unrealized gains and losses. Such factors could result in gains or losses being recorded in either "Unregulated wholesale energy", "Unregulated retail energy" or "Energy purchases" on the Statements of Income. This performance measure includes PLR revenues from energy sales to PPL Electric by PPL EnergyPlus, which are reflected in "PLR intersegment utility revenue (expense)" in the reconciliation table below (in "Unregulated wholesale energy to affiliate" in PPL Energy Supply's reconciliation table). "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" excludes adjusted energy-related economic activity, which includes the changes in fair value of positions used to economically hedge a portion of the economic value of the competitive generation assets, full-requirement sales contracts and retail activities. This economic value is subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power) prior to the 53 delivery period that was hedged. Adjusted energy-related economic activity includes the ineffective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges, the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts and premium amortization associated with options. This economic activity is deferred, with the exception of the full-requirement sales contracts that were monetized, and included in "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" over the delivery period that was hedged or upon realization. These measures are not intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of their operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage the operations, analyze actual results compared with budget and, in certain cases, to measure certain corporate financial goals used to determine variable compensation. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following tables contain the components from the Statement of Income that are included in the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to PPL's "Operating Income" for the years ended December 31. 2013 2012 Unregulated Unregulated Kentucky PA Gross Gross Operating Kentucky PA Gross Gross Operating Gross Delivery Energy Income Gross Delivery Energy Income Margins Margins Margins Other (a) (b) Margins Margins Margins Other (a) (b) Operating Revenues Utility $ 2,976 $ 1,866 $ 2,359 (c) $ 7,201 $ 2,759 $ 1,760 $ 2,289 (c) $ 6,808 PLR intersegment utility revenue (expense) (d) (51) $ 51 (78) $ 78 Unregulated wholesale energy 3,758 (714) (e) 3,044 4,416 (290) (e) 4,126 Unregulated retail energy (f) 1,019 8 (e) 1,027 865 (21) (e) 844 Energy-related businesses 588 588 508 508 Total Operating Revenues 2,976 1,815 4,828 2,241 11,860 2,759 1,682 5,359 2,486 12,286 Operating Expenses Fuel 896 1,045 3 (g) 1,944 872 931 34 (g) 1,837 Energy purchases 217 588 1,742 (580) (e) 1,967 195 550 2,204 (394) (e) 2,555 Other operation and maintenance 97 82 20 2,626 2,825 101 104 19 2,611 2,835 Loss on lease termination (Note 8) 697 697 Depreciation 5 1,156 1,161 51 1,049 1,100 Taxes, other than income 1 95 37 231 364 91 34 241 366 Energy-related businesses 7 556 563 484 484 Intercompany eliminations (4) 3 1 (3) 3 Total Operating Expenses 1,216 761 2,854 4,690 9,521 1,219 742 3,191 4,025 9,177 Total $ 1,760 $ 1,054 $ 1,974 $ (2,449) $ 2,339 $ 1,540 $ 940 $ 2,168 $ (1,539) $ 3,109 2011 Unregulated Kentucky PA Gross Gross Gross Delivery Energy Operating Margins Margins Margins Other (a) Income (b) Operating Revenues Utility $ 2,791 $ 1,881 $ 1,620 (c) $ 6,292 PLR intersegment utility revenue (expense) (d) (26) $ 26 Unregulated wholesale energy 3,743 1,469 (e) 5,212 Unregulated retail energy (f) 696 30 (e) 726 Energy-related businesses 507 507 Total Operating Revenues 2,791 1,855 4,465 3,626 12,737 54 2011 Unregulated Kentucky PA Gross Gross Gross Delivery Energy Operating Margins Margins Margins Other (a) Income (b) Operating Expenses Fuel 866 1,151 (71) (g) 1,946 Energy purchases 238 738 912 1,365 (e) 3,253 Other operation and maintenance 90 108 16 2,453 2,667 Depreciation 49 911 960 Taxes, other than income 99 30 197 326 Energy-related businesses 484 484 Intercompany eliminations (11) 3 8 Total Operating Expenses 1,243 934 2,112 5,347 9,636 Discontinued operations 12 (12) (h) Total $ 1,548 $ 921 $ 2,365 $ (1,733) $ 3,101 (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins.

(e) Includes energy-related economic activity, which is subject to fluctuations in value due to market price volatility. See "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading) - Economic Activity" within Note 19 to the Financial Statements. For 2012, "Unregulated wholesale energy" and "Energy purchases" include a net pre-tax loss of $35 million related to the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts. 2011 includes a net pre-tax loss of $216 million related to the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts and a net pre-tax gain of $19 million related to the amortization of option premiums. (f) Although retail energy revenues continue to grow, the net margins related to these activities are not currently a significant component of Unregulated Gross Energy Margins. (g) Includes economic activity related to fuel as described in "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading) - Economic Activity" within Note 19 to the Financial Statements. 2012 includes a net pre-tax loss of $29 million related to coal contract modification payments. 2011 includes pre-tax credits of $57 million for the spent nuclear fuel litigation settlement. (h) Represents the net of certain revenues and expenses associated with certain businesses that are classified as discontinued operations. These revenues and expenses are not reflected in "Operating Income" on the Statements of Income. Changes in Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following table shows the non-GAAP financial measures by PPL's reportable segment and by component, as applicable, for the year ended December 31 as well as the change between periods. The factors that gave rise to the changes are described following the table. $ Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Kentucky Regulated Kentucky Gross Margins LKE $ 1,760 $ 1,540 $ 1,548 $ 220 $ (8) LG&E 791 727 724 64 3 KU 969 813 823 156 (10) Pennsylvania Regulated Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins Distribution $ 803 $ 730 $ 741 $ 73 $ (11) Transmission 251 210 180 41 30 Total $ 1,054 $ 940 $ 921 $ 114 $ 19 Supply Unregulated Gross Energy Margins Eastern U.S. $ 1,756 $ 1,867 $ 2,015 $ (111) $ (148) Western U.S. 218 301 350 (83) (49) Total $ 1,974 $ 2,168 $ 2,365 $ (194) $ (197) 55 Kentucky Gross Margins Kentucky Gross Margins increased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to higher base rates of $102 million ($44 million at LG&E and $58 million at KU), environmental cost recoveries added to base rates of $53 million ($3 million at LG&E and $50 million at KU), returns from additional environmental capital investments of $34 million ($16 million at LG&E and $18 million at KU), higher fuel recoveries of $18 million ($7 million at LG&E and $11 million at KU) and higher volumes of $6 million ($9 million higher at KU partially offset by $3 million lower at LG&E). The increase in base rates was the result of new KPSC rates effective January 1, 2013 at LG&E and KU. The environmental cost recoveries added to base rates were due to the transfer of the 2005 and 2006 ECR plans into base rates as a result of the 2012 Kentucky rate cases for LG&E and KU. This transfer results in depreciation and other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the 2005 and 2006 ECR plans being excluded from Kentucky Gross Margins in 2013, while the recovery of such costs remain in Kentucky Gross Margins through base rates. Kentucky Gross Margins decreased in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to $6 million of lower wholesale margins at LG&E, resulting from lower market prices. Retail margins were $10 million lower at KU, as volumes were impacted by unseasonably mild weather during the first four months of 2012. Retail margins were $8 million higher at LG&E due to incremental returns on environmental investments, with retail volumes consistent with the prior year. Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins Distribution Distribution margins increased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to a $53 million favorable effect of price, largely comprised of higher base rates, effective January 1, 2013, a $15 million impact of weather primarily due to the adverse effect of mild weather in 2012 and higher volumes of $5 million. Distribution margins decreased in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to a $14 million impact of weather primarily due to the adverse effect of mild weather early in 2012 and lower revenue applicable to certain energy-related costs of $3 million due to fewer PLR customers in 2012, partially offset by a $7 million charge recorded in 2011 to reduce a portion of the transmission service charge regulatory asset associated with a 2005 undercollection that was not included in any subsequent rate reconciliations filed with the PUC. Transmission Transmission margins increased for both periods, primarily due to increased investment in plant and the recovery of additional costs through the FERC formula-based rates. Unregulated Gross Energy Margins Eastern U.S. Eastern margins decreased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to $435 million of lower baseload energy prices, partially offset by $198 million of higher capacity prices and $100 million of increased nuclear generation volume. Eastern margins decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to $121 million of lower baseload energy prices and $54 million of lower capacity prices. Western U.S. Western margins decreased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to $69 million of lower wholesale energy prices and $15 million of lower net economic availability of coal and hydroelectric units. Western margins decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to $34 million of lower wholesale volumes, including $31 million related to the bankruptcy of SMGT, $9 million of higher average fuel prices and $9 million of lower wholesale energy prices. 56 Statement of Income Analysis -- Utility Revenues The increase (decrease) in utility revenues was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Domestic: PPL Electric (a) $ 106 $ (121) LKE (b) 217 (34) Total Domestic 323 (155) U.K.: Price (c) 264 78 Volume (d) 5 (13) Recovery of allowed revenues (e) (43) (6) WPD Midlands line loss accrual adjustments (f) (142) Foreign currency exchange rates (27) (11) Other 13 (10) WPD Midlands (g) 633 Total U.K. 70 671 Total $ 393 $ 516 (a) See "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" for further information. (b) See "Kentucky Gross Margins" for further information. (c) The increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was due to price increases effective April 1, 2013 and April 1, 2012. The increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was due to price increases effective April 1, 2012 and April 1, 2011. (d) The increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the favorable effect of weather. The decrease in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the downturn in the economy and the unfavorable effect of weather. (e) The decrease in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to over-recovered revenues as a result of price and weather related volume effects that are not expected to reverse within the regulatory year ending March 31, 2014. Therefore, a liability was recorded and utility revenue reduced for the amount of the over-recovery in 2013. These amounts are expected to be refunded within the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2014. (f) The decrease was due to a $97 million increase in revenue in 2012 and a $45 million reduction in revenue in 2013 from adjusting a loss accrual based on information provided by Ofgem regarding the calculation of line loss incentives and penalties for all network operators, primarily related to DPCR4. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (g) Amounts in 2013 compared with 2012 are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 were not comparable with 2011, as 2011 includes eight months of WPD Midlands' results. The increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to four additional months of utility revenue in 2012 of $446 million. The comparable eight month period was higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to a $125 million price increase effective April 1, 2012 and the $97 million line loss accrual adjustment in 2012 discussed above. Certain Operating Revenues and Expenses Included in "Margins" The following Statement of Income line items are included above within "Margins" and are not discussed separately. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Unregulated wholesale energy $ (1,082) $ (1,086) Unregulated retail energy 183 118 Fuel 107 (109) Energy purchases (588) (698) Other Operation and Maintenance The increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Domestic: LKE coal plant operations and maintenance (a) $ (15) $ 21 Act 129 costs incurred (b) (24) (6) Vegetation management (c) 14 10 PPL Electric payroll-related costs (d) 4 17 Montana hydroelectric litigation (e) 65 PPL Susquehanna (f) (3) 33 Fossil and hydroelectric plants (g) 43 1 Ironwood Acquisition (h) 20 PUC-reportable storm costs, net of insurance recoveries (21) 14 PPL EnergyPlus (i) (18) 17 Stock based compensation 2 17 Other (10) 21 57 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 U.K.: Network maintenance (j) 32 11 Third-party engineering (k) 12 (3) Pension (l) 8 21 Separation benefits (m) (11) Employee-related expenses (7) Foreign currency exchange rates (4) (2) Acquisition-related adjustments (8) WPD Midlands (n) (85) Other (4) (4) $ (10) $ 168 (a) The decrease in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to $21 million of lower costs related to the timing and scope of scheduled outages, partially offset by increased generation costs. The increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to $11 million of expenses related to an increase scope of scheduled outages, as well as $5 million of increased maintenance at the Ghent plant on the scrubber system and primary fuel combustion system. (b) Relates to costs associated with PPL Electric's PUC-approved energy efficiency and conservation plan with programs starting in 2010. These costs are recovered in customer rates. The decrease in both periods primarily results from the number of programs and timing of such programs. Phase 1 of Act 129 closed in May 2013. Phase 2 programs began in June 2013. (c) PPL Electric incurred higher vegetation management costs in both periods due to increased activities related to maintaining and increasing system reliability for both the transmission and distribution systems. The amount for 2012 compared to the 2011 period was also higher due to increased costs to comply with federal transmission reliability requirements. (d) PPL Electric Utilities incurred higher payroll costs of $17 million in 2012 compared with 2011 due to less project costs being capitalized. (e) In February 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Montana state court decisions requiring PPL Montana to make lease payments for the use of certain Montana streambeds. As a result, in 2011, PPL Montana reversed its total loss accrual. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (f) 2012 compared with 2011 was higher due to outage and project costs. (g) In 2012, PPL Energy Supply announced its intention, beginning in April 2015, to place its Corette plant in long-term reserve status, suspending the plant's operations due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with MATS. During the fourth quarter of 2013, PPL Energy Supply determined its Corette plant was impaired and recorded a charge of $65 million for the plant and related emission allowances. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (h) Amounts in 2013 compared with 2012 are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 compared with 2011 were not comparable as 2012 includes nine months of expense and, therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for information on the acquisition. (i) 2013 compared with 2012 was lower primarily due to SMGT filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. $11 million of receivables billed to SMGT were fully reserved in 2012. For 2012 compared with 2011, no individual item was significant in comparison to the prior year. (j) The increases in both periods were primarily due to higher vegetation management costs. (k) These costs are offset by revenues reflected in "Utility" on the Statement of Income. (l) The increases in both periods were due to higher pension costs resulting from increased amortization of actuarial losses. (m) The decrease in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to costs incurred in 2012 related to the WPD Midlands reorganization. (n) Amounts in 2012 compared with 2011 were not comparable as 2011 includes eight months of WPD Midlands' results and therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. The increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was partially due to four additional months of expense in 2012 of $86 million. The comparable eight month period was $171 million lower in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to $86 million of lower separation benefits, $34 million of lower acquisition related costs, and $26 million of lower pension expense. Loss on Lease Termination A $697 million charge was recorded in 2013 for the termination of the Colstrip operating lease to facilitate the sale of the Montana hydroelectric generating facilities. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Depreciation The increase (decrease) in depreciation was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Additions to PP&E, net $ 89 $ 65 LKE lower depreciation rates effective January 1, 2013 (a) (22) WPD Midlands (b) 55 Ironwood Acquisition (c) 17 Other (6) 3 Total $ 61 $ 140 (a) A result of the 2012 rate case. (b) Amounts in 2013 compared with 2012 are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 were not comparable with 2011, which includes eight months of WPD Midlands' results and therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. The increase in 2012 compared with 2011 is primarily due to four additional months of expense in 2012 of $49 million. 58 (c) Amounts in 2013 compared with 2012 are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 compared with 2011 were not comparable as 2012 includes nine months of expenses and therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for information on the acquisition. Taxes, Other Than Income The increase (decrease) in taxes, other than income was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Domestic property tax expense (a) $ 3 $ 14 State capital stock tax (b) (5) (11) WPD Midlands (c) 33 Other 4 Total $ (2) $ 40 (a) The increase in 2012 compared with 2011 is primarily due to the fully amortized PURTA refund to the customers in 2011 pursuant to PUC regulations. This tax is included in "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" above. (b) The decrease in 2012 compared with 2011 was due to changes in the statutory rate from the prior year. (c) Amounts in 2013 compared with 2012 are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 compared with 2011 were not comparable as 2011 includes eight months of WPD Midlands' results and therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. The increase in 2012 compared with 2011 is primarily due to four additional months of expense in 2012 of $30 million. Other Income (Expense) - net The increase (decrease) in other income (expense) - net was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Economic foreign currency exchange contracts (Note 19) $ 14 $ (62) Net hedge gains associated with the 2011 Bridge Facility (a) (55) Foreign currency loss on 2011 Bridge Facility 57 Gain on redemption of debt (b) (22) WPD Midlands acquisition-related adjustments in 2011 (Note 10) 55 Losses from equity method investments 8 (9) Charitable contributions (15) (1) Other 9 (6) Total $ 16 $ (43) (a) Represents a gain on foreign currency contracts in 2011 that hedged the repayment of the 2011 Bridge Facility borrowing. (b) In July 2011, as a result of PPL Electric's redemption of 7.125% Senior Secured Bonds due 2013, PPL recorded a gain on the accelerated amortization of the fair value adjustment to the debt recorded in connection with previously settled fair value hedges. Other-Than-Temporary Impairments Other-than-temporary impairments decreased by $26 million in 2013 compared with 2012 and increased by $21 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a $25 million pre-tax impairment of the EEI investment in 2012. See Notes 1 and 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense The increase (decrease) in interest expense was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 2011 Bridge Facility costs related to the acquisition of WPD Midlands (Notes 7 and 10) $ (44) 2011 Equity Units (a) $ (2) 12 Long-term debt interest expense (b) 31 3 Short-term debt interest expense (c) 3 (12) Inflation adjustment on U.K. Index-linked Senior Unsecured Notes 4 (12) WPD Midlands (d) 80 Ironwood Acquisition (e) 12 Hedging activities and ineffectiveness 4 29 Capitalized interest (f) 6 (6) Montana hydroelectric litigation (g) 10 Loss on extinguishment of debt (h) 10 Other (11) (9) Total $ 45 $ 63 (a) Interest related to the issuance in April 2011 to support the WPD Midlands acquisition. 59 (b) 2013 increased due to debt issuances by PPL Capital Funding in March 2013, June 2012 and October 2012, by PPL Electric in July 2013 and August 2012, and WPD (East Midlands) in April 2012. Partially offsetting these increases was PPL Energy Supply's debt maturity in July 2013. (c) 2012 compared with 2011 was lower primarily due to lower interest rates on 2012 short-term borrowings coupled with lower fees on credit facilities. (d) Amounts in 2013 compared with 2012 are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 compared with 2011 were not comparable as 2011 includes eight months of WPD Midlands' results and therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. The increase in 2012 compared with 2011 is primarily due to four additional months of expense in 2012 of $74 million. (e) Amounts in 2013 compared with 2012 are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 compared with 2011 were not comparable as 2012 includes nine months of expense and therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for information on the acquisition. (f) Includes AFUDC. (g) In February 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Montana state court decisions requiring PPL Montana to make lease payments for the use of certain Montana streambeds. As a result, in 2011, PPL Montana reversed its total loss accrual including accrued interest. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (h) In May 2013, PPL Capital Funding remarketed and exchanged junior subordinate notes that were originally issued in June 2010 as a component of PPL's 2010 Equity Units. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for information on 2013 long-term debt activity. Income Taxes The increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Change in pre-tax income $ (335) $ (296) State valuation allowance adjustments (a) 11 (23) State deferred tax rate change (b) 34 7 Federal and state tax reserve adjustments (c) (42) (40) Federal and state tax return adjustments (d) (21) 33 U.S. income tax on foreign earnings net of foreign tax credit (e) (17) 57 U.K. Finance Act adjustments (f) (22) 2 Foreign valuation allowance adjustments (g) (147) Foreign tax reserve adjustments (g) 3 134 Foreign tax return adjustments 2 (6) Depreciation not normalized (a) 3 9 Net operating loss carryforward adjustments (h) 9 (9) WPD Midlands (i) 146 Other 10 (13) Total $ (365) $ (146) (a) The valuation allowances recorded on PPL's state deferred tax assets primarily relate to Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards. Pennsylvania requires that each corporation file a separate income tax return and has significant annual limitations on the deduction for net operating loss carryforwards. Currently, Pennsylvania allows an annual maximum deduction equal to the greater of $3 million or 20% of taxable income. Recent legislation increased the annual maximum deduction to the greater of $5 million or 30% of taxable income for tax years beginning in 2015. During 2013, PPL recorded $24 million state deferred income tax expense related to a deferred tax valuation allowance primarily due to a decrease in projected future taxable income over the remaining carryforward period of Pennsylvania net operating losses. During 2012, PPL recorded $9 million state deferred income tax expense related to a deferred tax valuation allowance primarily due to a decrease in projected future taxable income over the remaining carryforward period of Pennsylvania net operating losses. During 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued interpretive guidance on the treatment of bonus depreciation for Pennsylvania income tax purposes. The guidance allows 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying assets in the same year bonus depreciation is allowed for federal income tax purposes. Due to the decrease in projected taxable income related to bonus depreciation and a decrease in projected future taxable income, PPL recorded a $43 million state deferred income tax expense related to deferred tax valuation allowances during 2011. Additionally, the 100% Pennsylvania bonus depreciation deduction created a current state income tax benefit for the flow-through impact of Pennsylvania regulated state tax depreciation. The federal provision for 100% bonus depreciation generally applies to property placed into service before January 1, 2012. The placed in-service deadline was extended to January 1, 2013 for property that had a cost in excess of $1 million, had a production period longer than one year and had a tax life of at least ten years. PPL's tax deduction for 100% bonus regulated tax depreciation was zero in 2013 and was significantly lower in 2012 than in 2011. (b) Changes in state apportionment resulted in an increase to the future estimated state tax rate at December 31, 2013 and reductions to the future estimated state tax rate at December 31, 2012 and 2011. PPL recorded a $15 million deferred tax expense in 2013, a $19 million deferred tax benefit in 2012 and a $26 million deferred tax benefit in 2011 related to its state deferred tax liabilities. (c) In May 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the December 2011 ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on the creditability of U.K. Windfall Profits Tax for tax purposes. As a result of this decision, PPL recorded a tax benefit of $44 million during 2013. PPL recorded $39 million tax expense related to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit's ruling in 2011. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. PPL recorded a tax benefit of $7 million during 2013 and $6 million during 2012 and 2011 to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization. The reserve balance at December 31, 2013 related to stranded costs securitization is zero. 60 (d) During 2012, PPL recorded $16 million in federal and state income tax expense related to the filing of the 2011 federal and state income tax returns. Of this amount, $5 million relates to the reversal of prior years' state income tax benefits related to regulated depreciation. PPL changed its method of accounting for repair expenditures for tax purposes effective for its 2008 tax year. In August 2011, the IRS issued guidance regarding the use and evaluation of statistical samples and sampling estimates for network assets. The IRS guidance provided a safe harbor method of determining whether the repair expenditures for electric transmission and distribution property can be currently deducted for tax purposes. PPL adopted the safe harbor method with the filing of its 2011 federal income tax return. During 2011, PPL recorded $17 million in federal and state tax benefits related to the filing of the 2010 federal and state income tax returns. Of this amount, $7 million in tax benefits related to an additional domestic manufacturing deduction resulting from revised bonus depreciation amounts and $3 million in tax benefits related to the flow-through impact of Pennsylvania regulated state tax depreciation. (e) During 2013, PPL recorded $25 million income tax expense resulting from increased taxable dividends offset by a $19 million income tax benefit associated with a ruling obtained from the IRS impacting the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits that was reflected on an amended 2010 U.S. tax return. During 2012, PPL recorded a $23 million adjustment to federal income tax expense related to the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits. During 2011, PPL recorded a $28 million federal income tax benefit related to U.K. pension contributions. (f) The U.K.'s Finance Act 2013, enacted in July 2013, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 23% to 21% effective April 1, 2014 and from 21% to 20% effective April 1, 2015. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $97 million deferred tax benefit in 2013 related to both rate decreases. The U.K.'s Finance Act 2012, enacted in July 2012, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 25% to 24% retroactive to April 1, 2012 and from 24% to 23% effective April 1, 2013. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $75 million deferred tax benefit in 2012 related to both rate decreases. WPD Midlands' portion of the deferred tax benefit is $43 million. The U.K.'s Finance Act 2011, enacted in July 2011, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 27% to 26% retroactive to April 1, 2011 and from 26% to 25% effective April 1, 2012. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $69 million deferred tax benefit in 2011 related to both rate decreases. WPD Midlands' portion of the deferred tax benefit is $35 million. (g) During 2011, WPD reached an agreement with the HMRC related to the amount of the capital losses that resulted from prior years' restructuring in the U.K. and recorded a $147 million foreign tax benefit for the reversal of tax reserves related to the capital losses. Additionally, WPD recorded a $147 million valuation allowance for the amount of capital losses that, more likely than not, will not be utilized. (h) During 2012, PPL recorded adjustments to deferred taxes related to net operating loss carryforwards of LKE based on income tax return adjustments. (i) Amounts in 2013 compared with 2012 are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 compared with 2011 were not comparable as 2011 includes eight months of WPD Midlands' results and therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. The increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes. Noncontrolling Interests "Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests" decreased by $4 million in 2013 compared with 2012 and $12 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to PPL Electric's June 2012 redemption of all 2.5 million shares of its preference stock. PPL Energy Supply: Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis Earnings 2013 2012 2011 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to PPL Energy Supply Member $ (230) $ 474 $ 768 Special items, gains (losses), after-tax (531) 18 142 Excluding special items, pre-tax earnings in 2013 compared with 2012 decreased primarily due to lower baseload energy prices and higher depreciation, partially offset by higher capacity prices, higher nuclear generation volume, lower operation and maintenance expense and lower income taxes. Excluding special items, pre-tax earnings in 2012 compared with 2011 decreased primarily due to lower Eastern energy margins resulting from lower baseload energy and capacity prices, lower Western energy margins resulting from an early 2012 contract termination related to the bankruptcy of SMGT, higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation, partially offset by lower financing costs and income taxes. The table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income Attributable to PPL Energy Supply Member between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Unregulated Gross Energy Margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.

See "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading) - Economic Activity" within Note 19 to the Financial Statements. For 2012, "Unregulated wholesale energy" and "Energy purchases" include a net pre-tax loss of $35 million related to the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts. 2011 includes a net pre-tax loss of $216 million related to the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts and a net pre-tax gain of $19 million related to the amortization of option premiums. (d) Although retail energy revenues continue to grow, the net margins related to these activities are not currently a significant component of Unregulated Gross Energy Margins. (e) Includes economic activity related to fuel as described in "Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading) - Economic Activity" within Note 19 to the Financial Statements. 2012 includes a net pre-tax loss of $29 million related to coal contract modification payments. 2011 includes pre-tax credits of $57 million for the spent nuclear fuel litigation settlement. (f) Represents the net of certain revenues and expenses associated with certain businesses that are classified as discontinued operations. These revenues and expenses are not reflected in "Operating Income" on the Statements of Income. Statement of Income Analysis -- Certain Operating Revenues and Expenses Included in "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" The following Statement of Income line items are included above within "Unregulated Gross Energy Margins" and are not discussed separately. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Unregulated wholesale energy $ (1,082) $ (1,086) Unregulated wholesale energy to affiliate (27) 52 Unregulated retail energy 183 121 Fuel 84 (115) Energy purchases (650) (465) Energy-Related Businesses The $10 million net increase in contributions from energy-related businesses in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily relates to the mechanical services businesses, due to improved margins on construction and energy service projects in 2012. Other Operation and Maintenance The increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Fossil and hydroelectric plants (a) $ 43 $ 1 PPL EnergyPlus (b) (18) 17 PPL Susquehanna (c) (3) 33 Montana hydroelectric litigation (d) 65 Ironwood Acquisition (e) 20 Trademark royalties (f) (34) Other 9 10 Total $ 31 $ 112 (a) In 2012, PPL Energy Supply announced its intention, beginning in April 2015, to place its Corette coal-fired plant in Montana in long-term reserve status, suspending the plant's operations due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with MATS. During the fourth quarter of 2013, PPL Energy Supply determined its Corette plant was impaired and recorded a charge of $65 million for the plant and related emission allowances. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (b) 2013 compared with 2012 was lower primarily due to SMGT filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. $11 million of receivables billed to SMGT were fully reserved in 2012. For 2012 compared with 2011, no individual item was significant in comparison to the prior year. (c) 2012 compared with 2011 was higher primarily due to outage and project costs. (d) In February 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Montana state court decisions requiring PPL Montana to make lease payments for the use of certain Montana streambeds. As a result, in 2011, PPL Montana reversed its total loss accrual. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (e) Amounts in 2013 compared with 2012 are comparable and have not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 compared with 2011 were not comparable as 2012 includes nine months of expense and therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. See Note 10 to the Financial Statements for information on the acquisition. (f) In 2011, PPL Energy Supply was charged trademark royalties by an affiliate. The agreement was terminated in December 2011. Loss on Lease Termination A $697 million charge was recorded in 2013 for the termination of the Colstrip operating lease to facilitate the sale of the Montana hydroelectric generating facilities. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 63 Depreciation Depreciation increased by $33 million in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to net PP&E additions. Depreciation increased by $41 million in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to $16 million attributable to net PP&E additions and $17 million attributable to the Ironwood Acquisition in April 2012. Taxes, Other Than Income Taxes, other than income decreased by $2 million in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to a $7 million decrease in state capital stock tax offset by a $4 million increase in state gross receipts tax. Other Income (Expense) - net See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for details. Interest Income from Affiliates Interest income from affiliates decreased by $6 million in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to lower average loan balances with PPL Energy Funding. Interest Expense The increase (decrease) in interest expense was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Long-term debt interest expense (a) $ (5) $ (11) Short-term debt interest expense (b) (2) (10) Ironwood Acquisition (c) 12 Capitalized interest (d) 10 Net amortization of debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs (e) (1) (9) Montana hydroelectric litigation (f) 10 Other 1 2 Total $ 3 $ (6) (a) The decrease in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the July 2013 debt maturity. The decrease in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the debt redemption in July 2011, along with the repayment and subsequent issuance of debt in the fourth quarter of 2011. (b) The decrease in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to lower interest rates on 2012 short-term borrowings coupled with lower fees on credit facilities. (c) The change in 2013 compared with 2012 is comparable and has not been isolated for purposes of comparability. Amounts in 2012 compared with 2011 were not comparable as 2012 includes nine months of expense and therefore, have been isolated for purposes of comparability. (d) The increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the Rainbow hydroelectric redevelopment project. (e) The decrease in 2012 compared with 2011 includes the impact of accelerating the amortization of deferred financing fees of $7 million in 2011, due to the July 2011 redemption. (f) In February 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Montana state court decisions requiring PPL Montana to make lease payments for the use of certain Montana streambeds. As a result, in 2011, PPL Montana reversed its total loss accrual including accrued interest. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes The increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Change in pre-tax income $ (448) $ (191) State valuation allowance adjustments (a) 2 (20) State deferred tax rate change (b) 34 7 Federal income tax credits 4 Federal and state tax reserve adjustments (c) 8 (4) Federal and state tax return adjustments (d) (5) 26 Total $ (405) $ (182) 64 (a) The valuation allowances recorded on PPL Energy Supply's state deferred tax assets primarily relate to Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards. Pennsylvania requires that each corporation file a separate income tax return and has significant annual limitations on the deduction for net operating loss carryforwards. Currently, Pennsylvania allows an annual maximum deduction equal to the greater of $3 million or 20% of taxable income. Recent legislation increased the annual maximum deduction to the greater of $5 million or 30% of taxable income for tax years beginning in 2015. During 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued interpretive guidance on the treatment of bonus depreciation for Pennsylvania income tax purposes. The guidance allows 100% bonus for qualifying assets in the same year bonus depreciation is allowed for federal income tax purposes. Due to the decrease in projected taxable income related to bonus depreciation and a decrease in projected future taxable income, PPL Energy Supply recorded $22 million in state deferred income tax expense related to deferred tax valuation allowances during 2011. (b) Changes in state apportionment resulted in an increase to the future estimated state tax rate at December 31, 2013 and reductions to the future estimated state tax rate at December 2012 and 2011. PPL Energy Supply recorded a $15 million deferred tax expense in 2013, a $19 million deferred tax benefit in 2012 and a $26 million deferred tax benefit in 2011 related to its state deferred tax liabilities. (c) During 2013, PPL Energy Supply reversed $3 million in tax benefits related to a 2008 change in method of accounting for certain expenditure for tax purposes and recorded $4 million in federal tax expense related to differences in over (under) payment interest rates applied to audit claims as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision related to Windfall Profits Tax. (d) During 2011, PPL Energy Supply recorded $22 million in federal and state tax benefits related to the filing of the 2010 federal and state income tax returns. Of that amount, $7 million in tax benefits related to an additional domestic manufacturing deduction resulting from revised bonus depreciation amounts. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes. PPL Electric: Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis Earnings 2013 2012 2011 Net Income Available to PPL $ 209 $ 132 $ 173 Excluding special items, pre-tax earnings in 2013 compared with 2012 increased primarily due to higher distribution base rates that became effective January 1, 2013, higher transmission margins from additional capital investments, lower operation and maintenance expense and higher distribution sales volume due to weather, partially offset by higher depreciation. Excluding special items, pre-tax earnings in 2012 compared with 2011 decreased primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expense, higher income and non-income taxes, lower distribution margins as a result of mild weather early in the year, higher depreciation, partially offset by higher transmission revenue and lower financing costs due to the redemption of $250 million of preferred securities. The table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income Available to PPL between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins on a separate line within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins $ 114 $ 19 Other operation and maintenance 23 (50) Depreciation (18) (14) Taxes, other than income 5 (9) Other Income (Expense) - net (3) 2 Interest Expense (9) (1) Income Taxes (39) Distributions on preference stock 4 12 Total $ 77 $ (41) Margins "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business.

(b) As reported on the Statements of Income. Statement of Income Analysis -- Certain Operating Revenues and Expenses Included in "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" The following Statement of Income line items are included above within "Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins" and are not discussed separately. 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Retail electric $ 106 $ (121) Electric revenue from affiliate 1 (8) Energy purchases 38 (188) Energy purchases from affiliate (27) 52 Other Operation and Maintenance The increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to: 66 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Act 129 costs incurred (a) $ (24) $ (6) Vegetation management (b) 14 10 Payroll-related costs (c) 4 17 Allocation of certain corporate support group costs (19) 11 PUC-reportable storm costs, net of insurance recovery (18) 7 Other (2) 7 Total $ (45) $ 46 (a) Relates to costs associated with PPL Electric's PUC-approved energy efficiency and conservation plan with programs starting in 2010. These costs are recovered in customer rates. The decrease in both periods primarily results from the number of programs and the timing of such programs. Phase 1 of Act 129 closed in May 2013. Phase 2 programs began in June 2013. (b) PPL Electric incurred higher vegetation management costs in both periods due to increased activities related to maintaining and increasing system reliability for both the transmission and distribution systems. The 2012 compared with 2011 period was also higher due to activities related to compliance with federal transmission reliability requirements. (c) Higher payroll costs of $17 million in 2012 compared with 2011 due to less project costs being capitalized. Depreciation Depreciation increased by $18 million in 2013 compared with 2012, and by $14 million in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to net PP&E additions. Taxes, Other Than Income Taxes, other than income increased by $1 million in 2012 compared with 2011. The increase was primarily a result of the net effect of the fully amortized PURTA refund to customers of $10 million in 2011, partially offset by a decrease in gross receipts tax of $7 million in 2012. Financing Costs The increase (decrease) in financing costs was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Long-term debt interest expense (a) $ 12 $ 1 Distributions on Preference Stock (b) (4) (12) Other (3) Total $ 5 $ (11) (a) The increase was due to debt issuances in August 2012 and July 2013. (b) The decrease was due to the June 2012 redemption of all 2.5 million shares of preference stock. Income Taxes The increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Change in pre-tax income $ 47 $ (22) Federal and state tax reserve adjustments (a) (1) 1 Federal and state tax return adjustments (b) (8) 11 Depreciation not normalized (c) 2 9 Other 1 Total $ 40 $ (a) PPL Electric recorded a tax benefit of $7 million during 2013 and $6 million during 2012 and 2011 to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded costs securitization. The reserve balance at December 31, 2013 related to stranded costs securitization is zero. (b) PPL Electric changed its method of accounting for repair expenditures for tax purposes effective for its 2008 tax year. In August, 2011, the IRS issued guidance regarding the use and evaluation of statistical samples and sampling estimates for network assets. The IRS guidance provided a safe harbor method of determining whether the repair expenditures for electric transmission and distribution property can be currently deducted for tax purposes. PPL Electric adopted the safe harbor method with the filing of its 2011 federal income tax return and recorded a $5 million adjustment to federal and state income tax expense resulting from the reversal of prior years' state income tax benefits related to regulated depreciation. During 2011, PPL Electric recorded a $5 million federal and state income tax benefit as a result of filing its 2010 federal and state income tax returns. The tax benefit primarily related to the flow-through impact of Pennsylvania regulated 100% bonus tax depreciation. 67 (c) During 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued interpretive guidance on the treatment of bonus depreciation for Pennsylvania income tax purposes. The guidance allows 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying assets in the same year bonus depreciation is allowed for federal income tax purposes. The 100% Pennsylvania bonus depreciation deduction created a current state income tax benefit for the flow-through impact of Pennsylvania regulated state tax depreciation. The federal provision for 100% bonus depreciation generally applies to property placed in service before January 1, 2012. The placed in-service deadline was extended to January 1, 2013 for property that had a cost in excess of $1 million, had a production period longer that one year and had a tax life of at least ten years. The PPL Electric's tax deduction for 100% bonus depreciation was zero in 2013 and was significantly lower in 2012 than in 2011. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes. LKE: Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis Earnings 2013 2012 2011 Net Income $ 347 $ 219 $ 265 Special items, gains (losses), after-tax 3 (16) Excluding special items, earnings in 2013 compared with 2012 increased primarily due to higher electricity and gas base rates that went into effect January 1, 2013 and returns from additional environmental capital investments. Excluding special items, earnings in 2012 compared with 2011 decreased primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation, higher property taxes and losses from an equity method investment, partially offset by lower income taxes. The table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.

(b) 2013 was higher than 2012 primarily due to increases in software maintenance and property and liability insurance expenses. 2012 was lower than 2011 primarily due to a decrease in pension expense resulting from pension funding and lower interest cost. (c) 2012 was higher than 2011 primarily due to a $6 million credit to establish a regulatory asset recorded when approved in 2011 related to 2009 storm costs. 69 Depreciation The increase (decrease) in depreciation was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Lower depreciation rates effective January 1, 2013 (a) $ (22) Additions to PP&E 10 $ 12 Total $ (12) $ 12 (a) A result of the 2012 rate case. Taxes, Other Than Income Taxes, other than income increased $9 million in 2012 compared with 2011 due to an increase in property taxes resulting from property additions, higher assessed values and changes in property classifications to categories with higher tax rates. Other Income (Expense) - net Other income (expense) - net increased $8 million in 2013 compared with 2012 and decreased $14 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to losses from the EEI investment recorded in 2012. The EEI investment was fully impaired in the fourth quarter of 2012. Other-Than-Temporary Impairments Other-than-temporary impairments decreased $25 million in 2013 compared with 2012 and increased $25 million in 2012 compared with 2011 due to the $25 million pre-tax impairment of the EEI investment in 2012. See Notes 1 and 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $6 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to amortization of a fair market value adjustment of $7 million. Interest expense increased $4 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to LKE's issuance of $250 million of senior notes in September 2011, resulting in an $8 million increase in interest expense. This increase was partially offset by lower interest rates. Income Taxes The increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to: 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Change in pre-tax income $ 86 $ (34) Net operating loss carryforward adjustments (a) 9 (9) Other 5 (4) Total $ 100 $ (47) (a) Adjustments recorded in 2012 to deferred taxes related to net operating loss carryforwards based on income tax return adjustments. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) Income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) increased $8 million in 2013 compared with 2012 and decreased $5 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to an adjustment in 2012 to the estimated liability for indemnifications related to the termination of the WKE lease. 70 LG&E: Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis Earnings 2013 2012 2011 Net Income $ 163 $ 123 $ 124 Special items, gains (losses), after-tax 1 Earnings in 2013 compared with 2012 increased primarily due to higher electricity and gas base rates that went into effect January 1, 2013 and returns from additional environmental capital investments.

The EEI investment was fully impaired in the fourth quarter of 2012. Other-Than-Temporary Impairments Other-than-temporary impairments decreased $25 million in 2013 compared with 2012 and increased $25 million in 2012 compared with 2011 due to the $25 million pre-tax impairment of the EEI investment in 2012. See Notes 1 and 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $54 million in 2013 compared with 2012 and decreased $26 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the change in pre-tax income. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes. Financial Condition The remainder of this Item 7 in this Form 10-K is presented on a combined basis, providing information, as applicable, for all Registrants. Liquidity and Capital Resources (All Registrants) The Registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity available through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Additionally, subject to market conditions, the Registrants and their subsidiaries may borrow in the capital markets, and PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2014. The Registrants' cash flows from operations and access to cost-effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: any adverse outcome of legal proceedings and investigations with respect to the Registrants' current and past business activities; changes in the financial markets that could make obtaining new sources of bank and capital markets funding more difficult and more costly; and a downgrade in the Registrants' or their rated subsidiaries' credit ratings that could adversely affect their ability to access capital and increase the cost of credit facilities and any new debt. (All Registrants except PPL Electric) costs of compliance with existing and new environmental laws focused on electricity generation facilities, and for PPL and PPL Energy Supply with new security and safety requirements for nuclear facilities; changes in electricity, fuel and other commodity prices; operational and credit risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale power markets; potential ineffectiveness of the trading, marketing and risk management policy and programs used to mitigate PPL's risk exposure to adverse changes in electricity and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit; reliance on transmission and distribution facilities that PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas; and unavailability of generating units (due to unscheduled or longer-than-anticipated generation outages, weather and natural disasters) and the resulting loss of revenues and additional costs of replacement electricity. 75 (All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply) unusual or extreme weather that may damage transmission and distribution facilities or affect energy sales to customers; and the ability to recover and the timeliness and adequacy of recovery of costs associated with regulated utility businesses. (All Registrants) See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for further discussion of risks and uncertainties that could affect the Registrants' cash flows. The Registrants had the following at: PPL Energy PPL PPL (a) Supply Electric LKE LG&E KU December 31, 2013 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,102 $ 239 $ 25 $ 35 $ 8 $ 21 Notes receivable from affiliates 150 70 Short-term debt 701 20 245 20 150 December 31, 2012 Cash and cash equivalents 901 413 140 43 22 21 Short-term debt 652 356 125 55 70 Notes payable with affiliates 25 December 31, 2011 Cash and cash equivalents 1,202 379 320 59 25 31 Notes receivable from affiliates 198 15 Short-term investments 16 Short-term debt 578 400 (a) At December 31, 2013, PPL's cash and cash equivalents included $637 million denominated in GBP. If these amounts were remitted as dividends, PPL may be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits. Historically, dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries have been limited to distributions of the current year's earnings. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on undistributed earnings of WPD. Net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31 and the changes between periods were as follows. PPL Energy PPL PPL Supply Electric LKE LG&E KU 2013 Operating activities $ 2,857 $ 410 $ 523 $ 911 $ 356 $ 495 Investing activities (4,295) (631) (1,080) (1,493) (567) (853) Financing activities 1,631 47 442 574 197 358 2012 Operating activities $ 2,764 $ 784 $ 389 $ 747 $ 308 $ 500 Investing activities (3,123) (469) (613) (756) (289) (480) Financing activities 48 (281) 44 (7) (22) (30) 2011 Operating activities $ 2,507 $ 776 $ 420 $ 781 $ 325 $ 444 Investing activities (7,952) (668) (477) (277) (42) (279) Financing activities 5,767 (390) 173 (456) (260) (137) 2013 vs. 2012 Change Operating activities $ 93 $ (374) $ 134 $ 164 $ 48 $ (5) Investing activities (1,172) (162) (467) (737) (278) (373) Financing activities 1,583 328 398 581 219 388 2012 vs. 2011 Change Operating activities $ 257 $ 8 $ (31) $ (34) $ (17) $ 56 Investing activities 4,829 199 (136) (479) (247) (201) Financing activities (5,719) 109 (129) 449 238 107 76 Operating Activities The components of the change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities were as follows. PPL Energy PPL PPL Supply Electric LKE LG&E KU 2013 vs. 2012 Change - Cash Provided (Used): Net income $ (400) $ (704) $ 73 $ 128 $ 40 $ 91 Non-cash components 534 313 31 90 (30) (68) Working capital (332) 65 12 (31) 12 (15) Defined benefit plan funding 44 (38) (34) (98) (21) (44) Other operating activities 247 (10) 52 75 47 31 Total $ 93 $ (374) $ 134 $ 164 $ 48 $ (5) 2012 vs. 2011 Change - Cash Provided (Used): Net income $ 19 $ (294) $ (53) $ (46) $ (1) $ (41) Non-cash components 241 180 34 (48) 5 41 Working capital (178) 30 (79) (66) (65) 11 Defined benefit plan funding 60 77 54 100 43 29 Other operating activities 115 15 13 26 1 16 Total $ 257 $ 8 $ (31) $ (34) $ (17) $ 56 (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) A significant portion of PPL's Supply segment and PPL Energy Supply's operating cash flows is derived from its competitive baseload generation activities. PPL employs a formal hedging program for its baseload generation fleet, the objective of which is to provide a reasonable level of near-term cash flow and earnings certainty while preserving upside potential over the medium term to benefit from power price increases. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for further discussion. Despite PPL's hedging practices, future cash flows from operating activities from its Supply segment are influenced by energy and capacity prices and, therefore, will fluctuate from period to period. PPL's and PPL Energy Supply's contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel often require cash collateral or cash equivalents (e.g. letters of credit), or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a downgrade of PPL's or its subsidiaries' or PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings or adverse changes in market prices. For example, in addition to limiting its trading ability, if PPL's or its subsidiaries' or PPL Energy Supply's or its subsidiaries' ratings were lowered to below "investment grade" and there was a 10% adverse movement in energy prices, PPL and PPL Energy Supply estimate that, based on their December 31, 2013 positions, they would have been required to post additional collateral of approximately $406 million for PPL and approximately $318 million for PPL Energy Supply with respect to electricity and fuel contracts. PPL and PPL Energy Supply had adequate liquidity sources at December 31, 2013 if they would have been required to post this additional collateral. PPL and PPL Energy Supply have in place risk management programs that are designed to monitor and manage exposure to volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of generating units. (PPL) PPL's net income for 2013 includes a $271 million payment made in December 2013 related to terminating the operating lease arrangement for interests in the Colstrip facility in Montana and acquiring the previously leased interests. A portion of this payment was used to satisfy the lessors' principal, interest and make whole premium for the redemption of their 8.903% Pass Through Certificates due 2020, which did not represent obligations of PPL or its subsidiaries and, therefore, were not included in PPL's financial statements. Net income for 2013 also includes a non-cash charge of $426 million associated with the lease termination. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the transaction. Non-cash components of net income in 2013 compared with 2012 also included $209 million for the impact of non-cash hedging activities (primarily unrealized losses in 2013), $124 million for changes to the WPD line loss accrual and the $65 million charge for the impairment of the Corette facility, offset by a $352 million decline in deferred income taxes. In 2013 compared with 2012, the decrease in cash from changes in components of working capital was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable (primarily due to extended payment terms at LG&E and KU, higher rates and colder weather in 2013 at LG&E, KU and PPL Electric and increases at PPL Energy Supply's mechanical contracting business) and changes to certain tax-related accounts. The increase in cash provided by other operating activities was partially due to net proceeds of $104 million for the settlement in 2013 of forward starting interest rate swaps. 77 For PPL, in 2012 compared with 2011, non-cash components of net income primarily consisted of $341 million related to non-cash hedging activities (primarily unrealized gains recorded in 2011) and $139 million related to increased depreciation, partially offset by a $158 million decline in deferred income taxes. The decrease in cash from changes in components of working capital was primarily due to changes in prepayments (primarily due to the receipt in 2011 of a tax refund) and changes in net regulatory assets/liabilities (primarily due to higher collection on PPL Electric's Generation Supply Charge for its PLR customers in 2011), partially offset by a reduction of $156 million in returns of counterparty collateral. Included in the change in cash from operating activities is the impact of having an additional four months of WPD Midlands operations in 2012. WPD Midlands' cash from operating activities increased by $190 million in 2012 compared with 2011. (PPL Energy Supply) PPL Energy Supply's net income for 2013 includes a $271 million payment made in December 2013 related to terminating the operating lease arrangement for interests in the Colstrip facility in Montana and acquiring the previously leased interests. A portion of this payment was used to satisfy the lessors' principal, interest and make whole premium for the redemption of their 8.903% Pass Through Certificates due 2020, which did not represent obligations of PPL Energy Supply or its subsidiaries and, therefore, were not included in PPL Energy Supply's financial statements. Net income for 2013 also includes a non-cash charge of $426 million associated with the lease termination. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the transaction. Non-cash components of net income in 2013 compared with 2012 also included $212 million for the impact of non-cash hedging activities (primarily unrealized losses in 2013) and the $65 million charge for the impairment of the Corette facility, offset by a $448 million decline in deferred income taxes. For PPL Energy Supply, in 2012 compared with 2011, non-cash components of net income primarily consisted of $242 million related to non-cash hedging activities (primarily unrealized gains in 2011) and the $74 million reduction in the provision for the Montana hydroelectric litigation recorded in 2011, partially offset by a $165 million decline in deferred income taxes. The increase in cash from changes in components of working capital was primarily due to a reduction of $156 million in returns of counterparty collateral, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable (primarily affiliate receivables). (PPL Electric) For PPL Electric, in 2013 compared with 2012, the increase in net income resulted primarily due to higher distribution base rates that became effective January 1, 2013 and higher transmission margins from additional capital investments. The change in other operating activities was partially due to changes to certain tax-related accounts. For PPL Electric, in 2012 compared with 2011, the decrease in cash from changes in components of working capital was primarily due to changes from regulatory assets and liabilities, net (primarily due to higher collection on the generation supply charge from its PLR customers in 2011) and from prepayments (due to the receipt in 2011 of a tax refund), partially offset by accounts payable changes in 2011 (due to lower PLR prices and lower energy purchases (due to warmer weather in 2011 compared with 2010). (LKE) In 2013, LKE's non-cash components of net income included a $121 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to utilization of net operating losses. The decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by increases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder December weather in 2013, offset by an increase in accounts payable due to timing of fuel purchase commitments and payments. The increase in cash from LKE's other operating activities was driven primarily by $86 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps. In 2012, LKE's non-cash components of net income included an $85 million reduction in deferred income taxes due primarily to the utilization of a capital loss carry forward in 2011. The decrease in cash from changes in components of working capital was driven primarily by changes in receivables and unbilled revenues due to milder December weather in 2011 than in 2012 and 2010 and more income tax receivables collected in 2011 than in 2012. 78 (LG&E) In 2013, LG&E's increase in cash from changes in components of working capital was driven primarily by an increase in accounts payable due to timing of fuel purchase commitments and payments and an increase in accrued taxes due to decreased payments for property taxes in 2013, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder December weather in 2013, and higher fuel and underground gas storage inventory in 2013 attributable to an increase in fuel and natural gas prices. The increase in cash from LG&E's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps. In 2012, LG&E's decrease in cash from changes in components of working capital was driven primarily by changes in receivables and unbilled revenues due to milder December weather in 2011 than in 2012 and 2010, and lower inventory levels in 2011 as compared with 2010 driven by lower gas prices. (KU) In 2013, KU's decrease in cash from changes in components of working capital was driven primarily by increases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder December weather in 2013, offset by an increase in accounts payable due to timing of fuel purchase commitments and payments. The increase in cash from KU's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps. In 2012, KU's increase in cash from changes in components of working capital was driven primarily by lower income tax payments as a result of lower taxable income in 2012, partially offset by changes in receivables and unbilled revenues due to milder December weather in 2011 than in 2012 and 2010. Investing Activities (All Registrants) The components of the change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities were as follows.

(PPL) For PPL, in 2013 compared with 2012, the change in "Stock issuances/redemptions, net" primarily resulted from the July 2013 settlement of the 2010 Equity Units and the April and May 2013 settlements of forward sale agreements. Also, the 2012 activity included the June 2012 redemption of the remaining PPL Electric preference stock. The 2013 net stock issuances/redemptions proceeds of $1.3 billion were primarily contributed to PPL Energy Supply to fund a $300 million debt maturity, to repay short-term debt, terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the Colstrip facility in Montana and acquire the previously leased interests for $271 million and fund a $437 million repayment of outstanding debt related to the acquisition of the previously leased Lower Mt. Bethel facility. In addition, an $18 million distribution was made to the equity investors of LMB Funding, L.P., which was accounted for as a redemption of noncontrolling interests and reflected in "Other financing activities" in the table above. See Notes 7, 8 and 22 to the Financial Statements for additional information on these 2013 equity, debt and lease transactions. For PPL, in 2012 compared with 2011, the changes in "Debt issuances/retirements, net" and "Stock issuances/redemptions, net" were primarily due to cash received in 2011 from securities issued to fund the WPD Midlands acquisition. (PPL Energy Supply) For PPL Energy Supply, in 2013 compared with 2012, the change in "Debt issuance/retirement, net" was due to the 2013 repayment of a $300 million debt maturity and $437 million repayment of outstanding debt related to the acquisition of the previously leased Lower Mt.

(LKE) For LKE, in 2013 compared with 2012, the change in "Debt issuance/retirement, net" was due to the issuance of long-term debt by LG&E and KU in November 2013. The change in "Capital contributions/distributions, net" resulted from an increase in equity contributions received from PPL. The increase in cash provided by financing activities resulted from the long-term debt issuance noted above, the proceeds of which were used for capital expenditures related to environmental air projects, construction of Cane Run Unit 7 and for other general corporate purposes. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. 81 For LKE, in 2012 compared with 2011, the change in "Debt issuance/retirement, net" and "Capital contributions/distributions, net" was due to the issuance of long-term debt by LKE in 2011, the proceeds of which were used for distributions to PPL, whereas there were no debt issuances in 2012. The "Changes in net short-term debt" resulted from the issuance of short-term debt in 2012 and the repayment of short-term debt during 2011. (LG&E) For LG&E, in 2013 compared with 2012, the change in "Debt issuance/retirement, net" was due to the issuance of long-term debt in November 2013, the proceeds of which were used for the repayment of short-term debt, capital expenditures related to environmental air projects, construction of Cane Run Unit 7 and for other general corporate purposes.

The commitments under WPD's credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group with no one bank providing more than 13% of the total committed capacity. In addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants. Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements. The Registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis. At December 31, 2013, the Registrants were in compliance with these covenants. At this time, the Registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources. 83 See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the Registrants' credit facilities.

Total 2014 2015 - 2016 2017 - 2018 After 2018 PPL Long-term Debt (a) $ 20,935 $ 314 $ 2,118 $ 757 $ 17,746 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 17,550 960 1,838 1,736 13,016 Operating Leases (c) 201 59 70 30 42 Purchase Obligations (d) 7,060 2,379 2,476 981 1,224 Other Long-term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance Sheet under GAAP (e) (f) 1,048 303 637 108 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 46,794 $ 4,015 $ 7,139 $ 3,612 $ 32,028 PPL Energy Supply Long-term Debt (a) $ 2,547 $ 304 $ 658 $ 407 $ 1,178 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 1,025 137 209 147 532 Operating Leases (c) 83 31 36 13 3 Purchase Obligations (d) 2,559 738 826 643 352 Other Long-term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance Sheet under GAAP (e) (f) 30 30 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 6,244 $ 1,240 $ 1,729 $ 1,210 $ 2,065 86 Total 2014 2015 - 2016 2017 - 2018 After 2018 PPL Electric Long-term Debt (a) $ 2,324 $ 10 $ 100 $ 2,214 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 2,119 108 209 $ 204 1,598 Purchase Obligations (d) 257 76 91 45 45 Other Long-term Liabilities Reflected on the Balance Sheet under GAAP (e) (f) 19 19 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 4,719 $ 213 $ 400 $ 249 $ 3,857 LKE Long-term Debt (a) $ 4,585 $ 900 $ 3,685 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 3,302 $ 159 309 $ 319 2,515 Operating Leases (c) 79 16 22 12 29 Coal and Natural Gas Purchase Obligations (g) 2,049 799 959 191 100 Unconditional Power Purchase Obligations (h) 862 26 52 56 728 Construction Obligations (i) 1,270 684 543 43 Pension Benefit Plan Obligations (e) 38 38 Other Obligations 50 31 16 3 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 12,235 $ 1,753 $ 2,801 $ 624 $ 7,057 LG&E Long-term Debt (a) $ 1,359 $ 250 $ 1,109 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 1,247 $ 47 92 $ 101 1,007 Operating Leases (c) 31 6 9 4 12 Coal and Natural Gas Purchase Obligations (g) 1,178 413 585 94 86 Unconditional Power Purchase Obligations (h) 597 18 36 39 504 Construction Obligations (i) 639 368 270 1 Pension Benefit Plan Obligations (e) 8 8 Other Obligations 18 13 5 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 5,077 $ 873 $ 1,247 $ 239 $ 2,718 KU Long-term Debt (a) $ 2,101 $ 250 $ 1,851 Interest on Long-term Debt (b) 1,826 $ 75 151 $ 160 1,440 Operating Leases (c) 45 10 13 7 15 Coal and Natural Gas Purchase Obligations (g) 871 386 374 97 14 Unconditional Power Purchase Obligations (h) 265 8 16 17 224 Construction Obligations (i) 631 316 273 42 Pension Benefit Plan Obligations (e) 2 2 Other Obligations 30 16 11 3 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 5,771 $ 813 $ 1,088 $ 326 $ 3,544 (a) Reflects principal maturities only based on stated maturity dates, except for PPL Energy Supply's 5.70% REset Put Securities (REPS). See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the remarketing feature related to the REPS, as well as discussion of variable-rate remarketable bonds issued on behalf of PPL Energy Supply, LG&E and KU. The Registrants do not have any significant capital lease obligations. (b) Assumes interest payments through stated maturity, except for PPL Energy Supply's REPS, for which interest is reflected to the put date. For PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU the payments herein are subject to change, as payments for debt that is or becomes variable-rate debt have been estimated and for PPL, payments denominated in British pounds sterling have been translated to U.S. dollars at a current foreign currency exchange rate. (c) See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (d) The amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Primarily includes as applicable, the purchase obligations of electricity, coal, nuclear fuel and limestone as well as certain construction expenditures, which are also included in the Capital Expenditures table presented above. Financial swaps (for PPL and PPL Energy Supply) and open purchase orders that are provided on demand with no firm commitment are excluded from the amounts presented. (e) The amounts for PPL include WPD's contractual deficit pension funding requirements arising from actuarial valuations performed in March 2013. The U.K. electricity regulator currently allows a recovery of a substantial portion of the contributions relating to the plan deficit. The amounts also include contributions made or committed to be made in 2014 for PPL's and LKE's U.S. pension plans (for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU includes their share of these amounts). Based on the current funded status of these plans, except for WPD's plans, no cash contributions are required. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of expected contributions. (f) At December 31, 2013, total unrecognized tax benefits of $22 million for PPL and $15 million for PPL Energy Supply were excluded from this table as management cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period of future payments. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (g) Represents contracts to purchase coal, natural gas and natural gas transportation. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (h) Represents future minimum payments under OVEC power purchase agreements through June 2040. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (i) Represents construction commitments, including commitments for the LG&E's Mill Creek and KU's Ghent and E.W. Brown environmental air projects, LG&E's and KU's Cane Run Unit 7, KU's E.W. Brown landfill and LG&E's Ohio Falls refurbishment which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table presented above. 87 Dividends/Distributions (PPL) PPL views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts that are within the context of maintaining a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings. In February 2014, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable April 1, 2014, at 37.25 cents per share (equivalent to $1.49 per annum). Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors at the time. As discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements, subject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend on its common stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or its 4.32% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2019 or until deferred contract adjustment payments on PPL's Purchase Contracts have been paid. No such deferrals have occurred or are currently anticipated. (All Registrant except PPL) From time to time, as determined by their respective Board of Directors or Board of Managers, the Registrants other than PPL pay dividends or distributions, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends. (All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply) See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Purchase or Redemption of Debt Securities The Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities depending upon prevailing market conditions and available cash. Rating Agency Actions Moody's, S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. The following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2013. Senior Unsecured Senior Secured Commercial Paper Issuer Moody's S&P Fitch Moody's S&P Fitch Moody's S&P Fitch PPL PPL WEM Baa3 BBB- WPD (East Midlands) Baa1 BBB WPD (West Midlands) Baa1 BBB PPL WW Baa3 BBB- BBB WPD (South Wales) Baa1 BBB A- WPD (South West) Baa1 BBB A- P-2 PPL Capital Funding Baa3 BBB- BBB 88 Senior Unsecured Senior Secured Commercial Paper Issuer Moody's S&P Fitch Moody's S&P Fitch Moody's S&P Fitch PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply Baa2 BBB BBB- P-2 A-2 F3 PPL and PPL Electric PPL Electric A3 A- A- P-2 A-2 F2 PPL and LKE LKE Baa2 BBB- BBB+ LG&E A2 A- A+ P-2 A-2 F2 KU A2 A- A+ P-2 A-2 F2 A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt. In addition to the credit ratings noted above, the rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries. (PPL) In March 2013, Moody's, S&P and Fitch assigned ratings of Ba1, BB+ and BB+ to PPL Capital Funding's $450 million 5.90% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073. Fitch also assigned a stable outlook to these notes. In May 2013, Moody's, S&P and Fitch assigned ratings of Baa3, BBB- and BBB to PPL Capital Funding's $250 million 1.90% Senior Notes due 2018, $600 million 3.40% Senior Notes due 2023 and $300 million 4.70% Senior Notes due 2043. Fitch also assigned a stable outlook to these notes. In September 2013, Fitch affirmed the following ratings with a stable outlook: the long-term issuer default and senior unsecured ratings for PPL WW, WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West); and the short-term issuer default ratings for WPD (South Wales) and WPD (South West). In September 2013, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of Baa1 and BBB to WPD (East Midlands') 65 million 1.676% Index-Linked Senior Notes due 2052. In October 2013, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of Baa1 and BBB to WPD (West Midlands') 400 million 3.875% Senior Notes due 2024. In November 2013, Moody's placed the ratings of PPL on review for upgrade. In December 2013, Fitch affirmed the following ratings with a stable outlook: the long-term and short-term issuer default ratings for PPL and PPL Capital Funding; and the senior unsecured debt and junior subordinated notes ratings for PPL Capital Funding. In January 2014, Moody's affirmed its ratings and revised its outlook to stable for PPL. (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) In February 2013, Moody's upgraded its rating, from B2 to Ba1, and revised its outlook from under review to stable for PPL Ironwood. In April 2013, Fitch affirmed its rating and outlook on PPL Montana's pass-through certificates due 2020. In July 2013, Moody's withdrew its rating and outlook for PPL Ironwood. In July 2013, S&P lowered its rating, from BBB- to BB+, retained its negative outlook and assigned a recovery rating of 1 to PPL Montana's pass-through certificates due 2020. 89 In August 2013, Moody's affirmed its rating and revised its outlook from stable to negative on PPL Montana's pass-through certificates due 2020. In September 2013, S&P affirmed its rating and revised its outlook from negative to stable on PPL Montana's pass-through certificates due 2020. In December 2013, Fitch downgraded its long-term issuer default rating, from BBB to BBB-, short-term issuer default and commercial paper ratings, from F2 to F3, and retained its negative outlook for PPL Energy Supply. In January 2014, S&P withdrew its rating, outlook and recovery rating on PPL Montana's pass-through certificates due 2020. (PPL and PPL Electric) In July 2013, Moody's, S&P and Fitch assigned ratings of A3, A- and A- to PPL Electric's $350 million 4.75% First Mortgage Bonds due 2043. Fitch assigned a stable outlook and S&P assigned a recovery rating of 1+ to these notes. In November 2013, Moody's placed the ratings of PPL Electric on review for upgrade. In December 2013, Fitch affirmed its long-term issuer default rating, short-term issuer default rating, secured debt and commercial paper rating with a stable outlook for PPL Electric. In January 2014, Moody's upgraded its issuer rating, from Baa2 to Baa1, and senior secured rating, from A3 to A2, affirmed its commercial paper rating and revised its outlook to stable for PPL Electric. (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) In July 2013, S&P confirmed its ratings for KU's 2000 Series A Solid Waste Disposal Facility Revenue Bonds and KU's 2004 Series A, 2006 Series B and 2008 Series A Environmental Facilities Revenue Bonds. In November 2013, Moody's, S&P and Fitch assigned ratings of A2, A- and A+ to LG&E's $250 million 4.65% First Mortgage Bonds due 2043 and KU's $250 million 4.65% First Mortgage Bonds due 2043. Fitch assigned a stable outlook and S&P assigned a recovery rating of 1+ to both notes. In November 2013, Moody's placed the ratings of LKE, LG&E and KU on review for upgrade. In December 2013, Fitch affirmed the following ratings with a stable outlook: the long-term and short-term issuer default ratings for LKE, LG&E and KU; the senior unsecured debt rating for LKE; and the secured debt, secured pollution control bonds and commercial paper ratings for LG&E and KU. In January 2014, Moody's affirmed its ratings and revised its outlook to stable for LKE. In January 2014, Moody's upgraded its issuer ratings, from Baa1 to A3, and senior secured ratings, from A2 to A1, affirmed its commercial paper ratings and revised its outlook to stable for LG&E and KU. In February 2014, Moody's affirmed its ratings for KU's 2000 Series A Solid Waste Disposal Facility Revenue Bonds , KU's 2004 Series A and 2008 Series A Environmental Facilities Revenue Bonds and KU's 2006 Series B Environmental Facilities Revenue Refunding Bonds . Ratings Triggers (PPL) As discussed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements, certain of WPD's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (Moody's, S&P, or Fitch) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ in connection with a restructuring event. A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which WPD (East Midlands), WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales) and WPD (West Midlands) operate and would be a trigger event in that company. These notes totaled 3.8 billion (approximately $6.2 billion) nominal value at December 31, 2013. 90 (All Registrants except PPL Electric) Various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for PPL), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's, LKE's, LG&E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral that would have been required for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2013. Guarantees for Subsidiaries (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) PPL and PPL Energy Supply guarantee certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL and PPL Energy Supply believe that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (All Registrants) The Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements. Risk Management Market Risk (All Registrants) See Notes 1, 18, and 19 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations. The forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level. Commodity Price Risk (Non-trading) (PPL, LKE, LG&E, and KU) LG&E's and KU's retail electric and natural gas rates and municipal wholesale electric rates are set by regulatory commissions and the fuel costs incurred are directly recoverable from customers. As a result, LG&E and KU are subject to commodity price risk for only a small portion of on-going business operations. LG&E and KU sell excess economic generation to maximize the value of the physical assets at times when the assets are not required to serve LG&E's or KU's customers. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (PPL and PPL Electric) PPL Electric is exposed to market price and volumetric risks from its obligation as PLR. The PUC has approved a cost recovery mechanism that allows PPL Electric to pass through to customers the cost associated with fulfilling its PLR obligation. This cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates PPL Electric's exposure to market price risk. PPL Electric also mitigates its exposure to volumetric risk by entering into full-requirement energy supply contracts for the majority of its PLR obligations. These supply contracts transfer the volumetric risk associated with the PLR obligation to the energy suppliers. 91 (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) PPL Energy Supply segregates its non-trading activities into two categories: hedge activity and economic activity. Transactions that are accounted for as hedge activity qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The economic activity category includes transactions that address a specific risk, but were not eligible for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting was not elected. This activity includes the changes in fair value of positions used to hedge a portion of the economic value of PPL Energy Supply's competitive generation assets and full-requirement sales and retail contracts. This economic activity is subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power). Although they do not receive hedge accounting treatment, these transactions are considered non-trading activity. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information. To hedge the impact of market price volatility on PPL Energy Supply's energy-related assets, liabilities and other contractual arrangements, PPL Energy Supply both sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under FERC market-based tariffs throughout the U.S. and enters into financial exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts. PPL Energy Supply's non-trading commodity derivative contracts range in maturity through 2019. The following tables sets forth the changes in the net fair value of non-trading commodity derivative contracts at December 31. See Notes 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Gains (Losses) 2013 2012 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 473 $ 1,082 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (452) (1,005) Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (a) 58 7 Other changes in fair value 28 389 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 107 $ 473 (a) Represents the fair value of contracts at the end of the quarter of their inception. The following table segregates the net fair value of non-trading commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2013 based on the level of observability of the information used to determine the fair value. Net Asset (Liability) Maturity Maturity Less Than Maturity Maturity in Excess Total Fair 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years of 5 Years Value Source of Fair Value Prices based on significant observable inputs (Level 2) $ 125 $ (50) $ 7 $ 4 $ 86 Prices based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (13) 27 7 21 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 112 $ (23) $ 14 $ 4 $ 107 PPL Energy Supply sells electricity, capacity and related services and buys fuel on a forward basis to hedge the value of energy from its generation assets. If PPL Energy Supply were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements, under certain circumstances it could be required to pay liquidating damages. These damages would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price of the commodity. Depending on price changes in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant. Extreme weather conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions, nonperformance by counterparties (or their counterparties) with which it has energy contracts and other factors could affect PPL Energy Supply's ability to meet its obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement energy. Although PPL Energy Supply attempts to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform, or that it will not experience counterparty nonperformance in the future. Commodity Price Risk (Trading) PPL Energy Supply's trading commodity derivative contracts range in maturity through 2020. The following table sets forth changes in the net fair value of trading commodity derivative contracts at December 31. See Notes 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 92 Gains (Losses) 2013 2012 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period $ 29 $ (4) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (13) 20 Fair value of new contracts entered into during the period (a) 3 17 Other changes in fair value (8) (4) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ 11 $ 29 (a) Represents the fair value of contracts at the end of the quarter of their inception. The following table segregates the net fair value of trading commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2013 based on the level of observability of the information used to determine the fair value. Net Asset (Liability) Maturity Maturity Less Than Maturity Maturity in Excess Total Fair 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years of 5 Years Value Source of Fair Value Prices quoted in active markets for identical instruments $ (1) $ (1) Prices based on significant observable inputs (Level 2) (3) $ 9 $ 3 9 Prices based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) 2 (1) (3) $ 5 3 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period $ (2) $ 8 $ 5 $ 11 VaR Models A VaR model is utilized to measure commodity price risk in unregulated gross energy margins for the trading and non-trading portfolios. VaR is a statistical model that attempts to estimate the value of potential loss over a given holding period under normal market conditions at a given confidence level. VaR is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation technique based on a five-day holding period at a 95% confidence level. Given the company's disciplined hedging program, the non-trading VaR exposure is expected to be limited in the short-term. The VaR for portfolios using end-of-month results for 2013 was as follows. Trading Non-Trading 95% Confidence Level, Five-Day Holding Period Period End $ 11 $ 5 Average for the Period 6 7 High 11 10 Low 2 4 The trading portfolio includes all proprietary trading positions, regardless of the delivery period. All positions not considered proprietary trading are considered non-trading. The non-trading portfolio includes the entire portfolio, including generation, with delivery periods through the next 12 months. Both the trading and non-trading VaR computations exclude FTRs due to the absence of reliable spot and forward markets. The fair value of the trading and non-trading FTR positions was insignificant at December 31, 2013. Interest Rate Risk (All Registrants) The Registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. The Registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates. The following interest rate hedges were outstanding at December 31. 93 2013 2012 Effect of a Effect of a Fair Value, 10% Adverse Maturities Fair Value, 10% Adverse Exposure Net - Asset Movement Ranging Exposure Net - Asset Movement Hedged (Liability) (a) in Rates (b) Through Hedged (Liability) (a) in Rates (b) PPL Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaps (c) $ 1,325 $ 91 $ (44) 2044 $ 1,165 $ (7) $ (34) Cross-currency swaps (d) 1,262 (31) (177) 2028 1,262 10 (179) Economic hedges Interest rate swaps (e) 179 (37) (4) 2033 179 (58) (3) LKE Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaps (c) 300 14 (18) Economic hedges Interest rate swaps (e) 179 (37) (4) 2033 179 (58) (3) LG&E Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaps (c) 150 7 (9) Economic hedges Interest rate swaps (e) 179 (37) (4) 2033 179 (58) (3) KU Cash flow hedges Interest rate swaps (c) 150 7 (9) (a) Includes accrued interest, if applicable. (b) Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, except for cross-currency swaps which also includes foreign currency exchange rates. (c) Changes in the fair value of such cash flow hedges are recorded in equity or as regulatory assets or liabilities, if recoverable through regulated rates, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings. (d) Cross-currency swaps are utilized to hedge the principal and interest payments of WPD's U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings. (e) Realized changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recoverable through regulated rates and any subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities. The Registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates at December 31 is shown below.

In addition, PPL's domestic operations may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than U.S. dollars. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding foreign currency translation. PPL has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments. In addition, PPL enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected earnings. The following foreign currency hedges were outstanding at December 31. 94 2013 2012 Effect of a 10% Effect of a 10% Fair Value, Adverse Movement Maturities Fair Value, Adverse Movement Exposure Net - Asset in Foreign Currency Ranging Exposure Net - Asset in Foreign Currency Hedged (Liability) Exchange Rates (a) Through Hedged (Liability) Exchange Rates (a) Net investment hedges (b) 301 $ (20) $ (49) 2015 162 $ (2) $ (26) Economic hedges (c) 1,425 (86) (222) 2015 1,265 (42) (192) (a) Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability.

The positions outstanding exclude the amount of intercompany loans classified as net investment hedges. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (c) To economically hedge the translation of expected earnings denominated in GBP to U.S. dollars, PPL enters into a combination of average rate forwards and average rate options to sell GBP. NDT Funds - Securities Price Risk (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) In connection with certain NRC requirements, PPL Susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the PPL Susquehanna nuclear plant (Susquehanna). At December 31, 2013, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair value on the Balance Sheets. The mix of securities is designed to provide returns sufficient to fund Susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs. However, the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are primarily exposed to changes in interest rates. PPL actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement. At December 31, 2013, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated $66 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets, compared with $49 million at December 31, 2012. See Notes 18 and 23 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the NDT funds. (All Registrants) Defined Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan assets. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that the Registrants would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. The Registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk. However, the Registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and other energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations may impact the Registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) PPL Energy Supply includes the effect of credit risk on its fair value measurements to reflect the probability that a counterparty will default when contracts are out of the money (from the counterparty's standpoint). In this case, PPL Energy Supply would have to sell into a lower-priced market or purchase in a higher-priced market. When necessary, PPL Energy Supply records an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not pay for deliveries PPL Energy Supply has made but not yet billed, which are reflected in "Unbilled revenues" on the Balance Sheets. PPL Energy Supply has also established a reserve with respect to certain receivables from SMGT, which is reflected in accounts receivable on the Balance Sheets. (PPL and PPL Electric) In 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric's PLR procurement plan for the period of June 2013 through May 2015. To date, PPL Electric has conducted two of its four planned competitive solicitations. 95 Under the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit. In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market. All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. At December 31, 2013, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P, and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement. A small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the Agreement. There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers. See Notes 15, 16, 18 and 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the competitive solicitation process, the Agreement, credit concentration and credit risk. Foreign Currency Translation (PPL) The value of the British pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. In 2013, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $150 million, which primarily reflected a $330 million increase to PP&E and goodwill offset by an increase of $180 million to net liabilities. In 2012, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $99 million, which primarily reflected a $181 million increase to PP&E offset by an increase of $82 million to net liabilities. In 2011, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $51 million, which primarily reflected a $69 million reduction to PP&E offset by a reduction of $18 million to net liabilities. The impact of foreign currency translation is recorded in AOCI. (All Registrants) Related Party Transactions The Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures The Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with the projects, sell, cancel or expand them, execute tolling agreements or pursue other options. See Notes 8, 9 and 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the more significant activities. Environmental Matters Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The cost of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be material. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the cost for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. The following is a discussion of the more significant environmental matters. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements and "Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters" for additional information on environmental matters. GHG Regulations In June 2013, President Obama released his Climate Action Plan which reiterates the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. "in the range of" 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 through such actions as regulating power plant emissions, promoting increased use of renewables and clean energy technology, and establishing tighter energy efficiency standards. Also, by Presidential Memorandum the EPA was directed to issue a revised proposal for new power plants (a prior proposal was issued in 2012) by September 20, 2013, with a final rule to be issued in a timely fashion thereafter, and to issue proposed standards for existing power plants by June 1, 2014 with a final rule by June 1, 2015. The EPA was further directed to require that states develop implementation plans for existing plants by June 2016. 96 The EPA's revised proposal for new power plants was published in the Federal Register on January 8, 2014, with comments due on March 10, 2014. The proposed limits for coal plants can only be achieved through capture and sequestration, a technology which is not presently commercially viable and, therefore, effectively preclude the construction of new coal plants. The proposed standards for new gas plants may also not be consistently achievable. Regulation of existing plants could have a significant industry-wide impact depending on the structure and stringency of the final rule and state implementation plans. The Administration's recent increase in its estimate of the "social cost of carbon" (which is used to calculate benefits associated with proposed regulations) from $23.80 to $38 per metric ton in 2015 may lead to more costly regulatory requirements. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has opened this issue for public comment. Additionally, the Climate Action Plan goal to prepare the U.S. for the impacts of climate change could affect PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU and others in the industry as it could result in requirements to modify electricity delivery systems to improve the ability to withstand major storms and substantial capital investment may be needed to meet those requirements. Climate Change Physical effects associated with climate change could include the impact of changes in weather patterns, such as storm frequency and intensity, and the resultant potential damage, as applicable, to the Registrants' generation assets, electricity delivery systems, as well as impacts on the Registrants' customers. In addition, changed weather patterns could potentially reduce annual rainfall in areas where PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU have hydroelectric generating facilities or where river water is used to cool their fossil and nuclear (as applicable) powered generators. The Registrants cannot currently predict whether their businesses will experience these potential risks or estimate the cost of their related consequences. (All Registrants except PPL Electric) Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs) In June 2010, the EPA proposed two approaches to regulating the disposal and management of CCRs (as either hazardous or non-hazardous waste) under existing federal law. Under a litigation settlement agreement involving certain environmental groups, the EPA has agreed to issue its final rulemaking by the end of 2014. Regulations could impact handling, disposal and/or beneficial use of CCRs. The financial and operational impact is expected to be material if CCRs are regulated as hazardous waste, and significant if regulated as non-hazardous. In July 2013, the U.S. House of Representatives passed House Bill H.R. 2218, the Coal Residuals and Reuse Management Act of 2013, which would preempt the EPA from regulating CCRs under RCRA and set rules governing state programs. It remains uncertain whether similar legislation will be passed by the U.S. Senate. Recent ash spills that have occurred within the utility industry are adding increased pressure to regulate both active and legacy sites. Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs) In June 2013, the EPA published proposed regulations to revise discharge limitations for steam electric generation wastewater permits. The proposed limitations are based on the EPA review of available treatment technologies and their capacity for reducing pollutants and include new requirements for fly ash and bottom ash transport water and metal cleaning waste waters, as well as new limits for scrubber wastewater and landfill leachate. The EPA's proposed ELG regulations also contain some requirements that would affect the inspection and operation of CCR facilities, if finalized. The proposal contains several alternative approaches, some of which could significantly impact PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's coal-fired plants. The final regulation is expected to be issued in May 2014 but may be delayed. At the present time, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate a range of reasonably possible costs, but the costs could be significant. 316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structure Rule In April 2011, the EPA published a draft regulation under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, which regulates cooling water intakes for power plants. The draft rule has two provisions: requiring installation of Best Technology Available (BTA) to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms that are pulled into the plant cooling water system (entrainment), and imposing standards for reduction of mortality of aquatic organisms trapped on water intake screens (impingement). The final rule is now expected by April 17, 2014. The proposed regulation would apply to nearly all PPL-owned steam electric generation plants in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Montana, potentially even including those equipped with closed-cycle cooling systems. PPL's, PPL Energy Supply's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's compliance costs could be significant, especially if the final rule requires closed-cycle systems at plants that do not currently have them or conversions of once-through systems to closed-cycle. 97 MATS In February 2013, the EPA finalized MATS requiring fossil-fuel fired plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by April 16, 2015. The rule is being challenged by industry groups and states. The EPA has subsequently proposed changes to the rule with respect to new sources to address the concern that the rule effectively precludes construction of any new coal-fired plants. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU are generally well-positioned to comply with MATS, primarily due to recent investments in environmental controls at PPL Energy Supply and approved ECR plans to install additional controls at some of LG&E's and KU's Kentucky plants. Additionally, PPL Energy Supply is evaluating chemical additive systems for mercury control at Brunner Island, and modifications to existing controls at Colstrip for improved particulate matter reductions. In September 2012, PPL Energy Supply announced its intention to place its Corette plant in long-term reserve status beginning in April 2015 due to expected market conditions and costs to comply with MATS. The Corette plant asset group was determined to be impaired in December 2013. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)" for additional information. Also, PPL has received approval for one-year compliance extensions for certain plants in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Other extension requests are under consideration from LG&E, KU and PPL Energy Supply. LG&E's and KU's anticipated retirements of generating units at the Cane Run and Green River plants are in response to MATS and other environmental regulations. CSAPR and CAIR In 2011, the EPA finalized its CSAPR regulating emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide through new allowance trading programs which were to be implemented in two phases (2012 and 2014). Like its predecessor, the CAIR, CSAPR targeted sources in the eastern U.S. In December 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit Court) stayed implementation of CSAPR, leaving CAIR in place. Subsequently, in August 2012, the D. C. Circuit Court vacated CSAPR and remanded it back to the EPA for further rulemaking, again leaving CAIR in place in the interim. In June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court granted the EPA's petition for review of the D.C. Circuit Court's decision to vacate CSAPR. Oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court were held in December 2013. Prior to a revised transport rule from the EPA, coal-fired generating plants could face tighter emission limitations on nitrogen oxides through state action. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU plants in Pennsylvania and Kentucky will continue to comply with CAIR through optimization of existing controls, balanced with emission allowance purchases. The D. C. Circuit Court's August 2012 decision leaves plants in CSAPR-affected states potentially exposed to more stringent emission reductions for nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide due to regional haze implementation (see Regional Haze discussion below), and/or petitions to the EPA by downwind states under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act requesting the EPA to require plants that allegedly contribute to downwind non-attainment to take action to reduce emissions. Regional Haze Under the EPA's regional haze programs (developed to eliminate man-made visibility degradation by 2064), states are required to make reasonable progress every decade, including the application of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) on power plants commissioned between 1962 and 1977. For the eastern U.S., the EPA had determined that region-wide reductions under the CSAPR trading program could be utilized by state programs to satisfy BART requirements for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. However, the August 2012 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court to vacate and remand CSAPR exposes power plants located in the eastern U.S., including PPL Energy Supply's plants in Pennsylvania and LG&E's and KU's plants in Kentucky, to further reductions in those pollutants in accordance with BART requirements. The EPA signed its final Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) of the Regional Haze Rules for Montana in September 2012, with tighter emissions limits for PPL Energy Supply's Colstrip Units 1 & 2 based on the installation of new controls (no limits or additional controls were specified for PPL Energy Supply's Colstrip Units 3 & 4), and tighter emission limits for PPL Energy Supply's Corette plant (which are not based on additional controls). The cost of the potential additional controls for Colstrip Units 1 & 2, if required, could be significant. PPL Energy Supply expects to meet the tighter permit limits at Corette without any significant changes to operations, although other requirements have led to the planned suspension of operations at Corette beginning in April 2015 (see "MATS" discussion above). Both PPL and environmental groups have appealed the final FIP rules to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 98 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (LKE, LG&E and KU) During 2010 and 2012, the EPA issued new ambient air standards for sulfur dioxide and particulates, respectively. In 2013, the EPA preliminarily designated Jefferson County, Kentucky, as a partial non-attainment area for sulfur dioxide. Final designations of non-attainment areas may occur in 2014. Existing environmental plans for LG&E's and KU's Kentucky plants, including announced retirements of certain plants and ECR-approved new or upgraded scrubbers or baghouses at other plants, may aid in achievement of eventual ambient air requirements. However, depending upon the specifics of final non-attainment designations and consequent compliance plans, additional controls may be required, the financial impact of which could be significant. (All Registrants) Competition See "Competition" under each of PPL's reportable segments in "Item 1. Business - Segment Information" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting the Registrants. New Accounting Guidance See Notes 1 and 25 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance adopted and pending adoption. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations, and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application and the estimates and assumptions regarding them. Price Risk Management (All Registrants except PPL Electric) See "Price Risk Management" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, as well as "Risk Management" above. Defined Benefits (All Registrants) Certain of the Registrants' subsidiaries sponsor or participate in, as applicable, various qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. These plans are applicable to the majority of the Registrants' employees (based on eligibility for their applicable plans). The Registrants and certain of their subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits. A summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below. PPL Energy Plan Sponsor PPL Supply PPL Electric LKE LG&E KU PPL Services S P P WPD (a) S PPL Montana S LKE S P P LG&E S (a) Does not sponsor or participate in other postretirement benefits plans. 99 Management makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. When accounting for defined benefits, delayed recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle. Annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI, or in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities, for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. The primary assumptions are: Discount Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. Expected Return on Plan Assets - Management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the Registrants record currently. Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. Health Care Cost Trend Rate - Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care. (PPL) In selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. These plan-specific cash flows are matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate, which uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base. From this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. An individual bond matching approach, which is used for the U.S. pension plans as discussed below, is not used for the U.K. pension plans because the universe of bonds in the U.K. is not deep enough to adequately support such an approach. (All Registrants) In selecting the discount rates for U.S. defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. This bond matching process begins with the full universe of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, serving as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. Individual bonds are then selected based on the timing of each plan's cash flows and parameters are established as to the percentage of each individual bond issue that could be hypothetically purchased and the surplus reinvestment rates to be assumed. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used for discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase at December 31. Assumption / Registrant 2013 2012 Discount rate Pension - PPL (U.S.) 5.12% 4.22% Pension - PPL (U.K.) 4.41% 4.27% Pension - PPL Energy Supply 5.18% 4.25% Pension - LKE 5.18% 4.24% Pension - LG&E 5.13% 4.20% Other Postretirement - PPL 4.91% 4.00% Other Postretirement - PPL Energy Supply 4.51% 3.77% Other Postretirement - LKE 4.91% 3.99% 100 Assumption / Registrant 2013 2012 Expected return on plan assets Pension - PPL (U.S.) 7.00% 7.03% Pension - PPL (U.K.) 7.19% 7.16% Pension - PPL Energy Supply 7.00% 7.00% Pension - LKE 7.00% 7.10% Pension - LG&E 7.00% 7.10% Other Postretirement - PPL 5.96% 5.94% Other Postretirement - LKE 6.75% 6.76% Rate of compensation increase Pension - PPL (U.S.) 3.97% 3.98% Pension - PPL (U.K.) 4.00% 4.00% Pension - PPL Energy Supply 3.94% 3.95% Pension - LKE 4.00% 4.00% Other Postretirement - PPL 3.96% 3.97% Other Postretirement - PPL Energy Supply 3.94% 3.95% Other Postretirement - LKE 4.00% 4.00% In selecting health care cost trend rates, plan sponsors consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs. At December 31, 2013, the health care cost trend rates for all plans were 7.6% for 2014, gradually declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5.0% in 2020. A variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2013, the defined benefit plans were recorded in the Registrants' financial statements as follows. PPL Energy PPL Supply PPL Electric LKE LG&E KU Balance Sheet: Regulatory assets/liabilities $ 483 $ 257 $ 226 $ 164 $ 62 Pension liabilities 1,294 $ 112 96 155 19 11 Other postretirement benefit liabilities 216 47 41 119 73 42 AOCI (pre-tax) (2,561) (319) 19 Statement of Income: Defined benefits costs $ 169 $ 51 $ 21 $ 40 $ 18 11 Increase (decrease) from prior year 3 8 (1) The following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the Registrants' primary defined benefit plans. The tables reflect either an increase or decrease in each assumption. The inverse of this change would impact the accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities by a similar amount in the opposite direction. The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.

Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments) (All Registrants except PPL Electric) Impairment analyses are performed for long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. For these long-lived assets classified as held and used, such events or changes in circumstances are: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset; a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses; or a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For a long-lived asset classified as held and used, an impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. Management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows, including the useful lives of the assets, the forward prices for revenue and fuel components in the markets where the assets are utilized, the amount of capital and operations and maintenance spending and management's intended use of the assets. Alternate courses of action are considered to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived asset, and estimated cash flows from the "most likely" alternative are used to assess impairment whenever one alternative is clearly the most likely outcome. If no alternative is clearly the most likely, then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternatives. For assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date, including an assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of the assets. That assessment is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date. Changes in assumptions and estimates could result in materially different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. 102 (PPL and PPL Energy Supply) In September 2012, PPL Energy Supply announced its intention, beginning in April 2015, to place the Corette coal-fired plant in Montana in long-term reserve status, suspending the plant's operation, due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with MATS requirements. PPL Energy Supply has been monitoring the plant for potential impairment since this announcement and until the fourth quarter of 2013, no impairment was indicated as various price scenarios allowed for recovery of the asset. During the fourth quarter, in connection with the completion of its annual business planning process, management updated its fundamental view for long-term power and gas prices. Based upon this fundamental view, management has altered its expectations regarding the probability that the Corette plant will operate subsequent to initially placing it in long-term reserve status. It is now less likely that the plant will restart after operations are suspended no later than April 2015. As a result, based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount for Corette was no longer recoverable. PPL Energy Supply performed an internal analysis using an income approach based on discounted cash flows to assess the fair value of the Corette asset group. Assumptions used in the fair value assessment were forward energy prices, expectations for demand for energy in Corette's market and expected operation and maintenance and capital expenditures that were consistent with assumptions used in the business planning process. Through this analysis, PPL Energy Supply determined the fair value of the asset group to be negligible. This resulted in PPL and PPL Energy Supply recording an impairment charge of $65 million, or $39 million after-tax for the Corette plant and related excess emission allowances. The current depressed levels of energy and capacity prices in PJM, as well as management's forward view of these prices using its fundamental pricing models recently updated in conjunction with the annual business planning process, continue to put pressure on the recoverability of PPL Energy Supply's investment in its Pennsylvania coal-fired generation assets. In the fourth quarter of 2013, management tested the Brunner Island and Montour plants for impairment and concluded neither plant was impaired as of December 31, 2013. The recoverability test is very sensitive to forward energy and capacity price assumptions, as well as forecasted operation and maintenance and capital spending. Therefore, a further decline in forecasted long-term energy or capacity prices or changes in environmental laws requiring additional capital or operation and maintenance expenditures, could negatively impact PPL Energy Supply's operations of these facilities and potentially result in future impairment charges for some or all of the carrying value of these plants. The carrying value of the Pennsylvania coal-fired generation assets tested was $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 ($1.4 billion for Brunner Island and $1.3 billion for Montour). See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on MATS and other environmental requirements for coal-fired generation plants. (All Registrants, except PPL Electric) For a long-lived asset classified as held for sale, an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. If the asset (disposal group) is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the carrying amount to its fair value less cost to sell. A gain is recognized in future periods for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment previously recognized. For determining fair value, quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence. However, when market prices are unavailable, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU consider all valuation techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which market participant inputs can be obtained. Generally discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair value, which incorporates market participant inputs when available. Discounted cash flows are calculated by estimating future cash flow streams and determining the present value of the cash flow streams using risk adjusted discount rates. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. PPL has determined its reporting units to be at the same level as its reportable segments. PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU each operate within a single reportable segment and single reporting unit. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of. Beginning in 2012, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a two-step quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as "step zero") is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary. 103 When the two-step quantitative impairment test is elected or required as a result of the step zero assessment, in step one, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LG&E and KU determine whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, on the measurement date. If the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the quantitative test requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill. PPL (for its U.K. Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments), and individually, LKE, LG&E and KU elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2013. These evaluations considered the excess of fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit that was calculated during step one of the quantitative impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the relevant events and circumstances that occurred since those tests were performed including: current year financial performance versus the prior year, changes in planned capital expenditures, the consistency of forecasted free cash flows, earnings quality and sustainability, changes in market participant discount rates, changes in long-term growth rates, changes in PPL's market capitalization, and the overall economic and regulatory environments in which these regulated entities operate. Based on the overall favorable results of these evaluations, management did not conclude it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units were less than their carrying values. As such, the two-step quantitative impairment test was not performed. PPL (for its Supply segment) and PPL Energy Supply elected to bypass step zero as depressed wholesale market prices for electricity and natural gas have negatively impacted the fair value of these reporting units. Therefore, the goodwill for these reporting units was tested for impairment using the quantitative test in the fourth quarter of 2013, and no impairment was recognized. Management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate by 0.25%, or a 10% decrease in the market multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for these reporting units. Loss Accruals (All Registrants) Losses are accrued for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain or contingent future outcomes. For loss contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events are likely to occur." The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded unless recovery is assured. Potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events are continuously assessed. The accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual, and (3) the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects require significant judgment by management. Internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers) are consulted, as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss. 104 For PPL, see Note 6 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the Ofgem Review of Line Loss Calculation, including the increases of $45 million to this liability recorded in 2013 by WPD. Certain other events have been identified that could give rise to a loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual. Such events are disclosed, but not recorded, when it is "reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred. Accounting guidance defines "reasonably possible" as cases in which "the future event or events occurring is more than remote, but less than likely to occur." When an estimated loss is accrued, the triggering events for subsequently adjusting the loss accrual are identified, where applicable. The triggering events generally occur when new information becomes known, the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is settled or written off, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated. The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the adjustment of certain recorded loss accruals: Allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately collected. Environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and actual payments are made, a better estimate of the loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered probable. Actions or decisions by certain regulators could result in a better estimate of a previously recorded loss accrual. Loss accruals are reviewed on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are appropriate. This involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers, business unit management and other parties. See Notes 6 and 15 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of loss contingencies accrued and other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual. Asset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants, except PPL Electric) ARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. The initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the statement of income, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time. (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) In the case of LG&E and KU, because costs of removal are collected in rates, the depreciation and accretion expenses related to an ARO are recorded as a regulatory asset, such that there is no earnings impact. (All Registrants, except PPL Electric) See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs. In determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that considers estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. 105 At December 31, 2013, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows. Most Significant AROs Total ARO Amount Recorded Recorded % of Total Description Nuclear decommissioning, ash ponds, PPL $ 705 $ 533 76 landfills and natural gas mains PPL Energy Supply 404 342 85 Nuclear decommissioning LKE 252 191 76 Ash ponds, landfills and natural gas mains LG&E 74 46 62 Ash ponds, landfills and natural gas mains KU 178 145 81 Ash ponds and landfills The most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including the settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), the discount rates and the inflation rates. At December 31, 2013, a 10% change to retirement cost, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate or a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would not have a significant impact on the ARO liabilities of the Registrants. For PPL and PPL Energy Supply, there would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions. As noted above, these factors do not impact the Statements of Income of LKE, LG&E and KU. Income Taxes (All Registrants) Significant management judgment is required in developing the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. Tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement. On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. At December 31, 2013, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease by as much as the following. Increase Decrease PPL $ 22 PPL Energy Supply 15 These changes could result from subsequent recognition, derecognition and/or changes in the measurement of uncertain tax positions related to the timing and utilization of tax credits and the related impact on alternative minimum tax and other credits, the timing and/or valuation of certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing groups. The events that could cause these changes are direct settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute of limitation. In addition, for PPL, this change could also relate to the creditability of foreign taxes and the timing and utilization of foreign tax credits. For PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits are projected over the next 12 months. 106 The balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant management judgment. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. Management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities (PPL) WPD operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by Ofgem. WPD's electricity distribution revenues are set every five years (changing to every eight years beginning on April 1, 2015) through price controls that are not directly based on cost recovery. Therefore, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. (All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply) PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets. At December 31, 2013, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities were recorded as reflected in the table below. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices. PPL PPL Electric LKE LG&E KU Regulatory assets $ 1,279 $ 778 $ 501 $ 320 $ 181 Regulatory liabilities 1,138 91 1,047 491 556 See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities. 107 Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU) Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data and where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. At December 31, unbilled revenues recorded on the Balance Sheets were as follows. 2013 2012 PPL Electric $ 116 $ 110 LKE 180 156 LG&E 85 72 KU 95 84 Other Information (All Registrants) PPL's Audit Committee has approved the independent auditor to provide audit and audit-related services, tax services and other services permitted by Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC rules. The audit and audit-related services include services in connection with statutory and regulatory filings, reviews of offering documents and registration statements, and internal control reviews. 108
