ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information." Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). The following discussion includes organic net sales growth and free cash flow which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, together with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to investors because they reflect the financial measures that management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. Overview We are a global technology leader. We design and manufacture connectivity and sensors solutions essential in today's increasingly connected world. We help our customers solve the need for intelligent, efficient, and high-performing products and solutions. During fiscal 2014, we realigned certain businesses within our segment reporting structure to better align our product portfolio. We continue to operate through four reporting segments: Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, Network Solutions, and Consumer Solutions. See Notes 1 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments. Prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets. Overall, our fiscal 2014 net sales increased 4.8% as compared to fiscal 2013. Increased net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment were partially offset by declines in the Network Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Consumer Solutions segment. On an organic basis, net sales increased 4.6% during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. In the Transportation Solutions segment, our net sales in the automotive end market increased 10.4% on an organic basis during fiscal 2014, with sales increases in all regions. In the Industrial Solutions segment, our organic net sales increased 5.2% in fiscal 2014, due primarily to growth in the industrial equipment and aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end markets, driven by the Asia Pacific region. In the Network Solutions segment, on an organic basis, our net sales decreased 3.2% in fiscal 2014, due primarily to declines in the subsea communications and data communications end markets. In the Consumer Solutions segment, our organic net sales decreased 1.0% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as declines in the consumer devices end market were partially offset by increases in the appliances end market. Overall, our fiscal 2013 net sales were consistent with fiscal 2012 levels. Increased net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment were offset by declines in the Network Solutions and Consumer 32 Table of Contents Solutions segments. On an organic basis, our net sales decreased 1.3% during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. In the Transportation Solutions segment, our organic net sales in the automotive end market increased 4.9% during fiscal 2013, with sales increases in the Americas and, to a lesser degree, the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions. In the Network Solutions segment, our organic net sales decreased 5.8% in fiscal 2013, due primarily to weakness in the subsea communications and data communications end markets. In the Industrial Solutions segment, on an organic basis, our net sales decreased 4.6% in fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of declines in the industrial equipment end market. In the Consumer Solutions segment, our organic net sales decreased 5.1% in fiscal 2013, due primarily to declines in the consumer devices end market. The acquisition of Deutsch in April 2012 benefited our sales in the automotive and aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end markets in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, respectively, and contributed net sales of $327 million in fiscal 2012. Also, Deutsch contributed incremental net sales of $320 million in the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012. Outlook In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect net sales to be between $3.46 billion and $3.56 billion, primarily reflecting sales increases of approximately 10% in the Transportation Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, in the Industrial Solutions segment, partially offset by a decrease in the Consumer Solutions segment relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2014. In the Transportation Solutions segment, we expect our sales growth to outpace an anticipated 1% to 2% growth in global automotive production in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2014. In addition, the Transportation Solutions segment will benefit from the recently completed acquisition of Measurement Specialties. In the Industrial Solutions segment, we expect our sales to increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014, due primarily to increased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market. Our sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market will benefit from the acquisition of the SEACON Group ("SEACON"). In the Network Solutions segment, we expect a modest sales increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, due primarily to increased sales in the subsea communications end market. We expect our net sales in the subsea communications end market to be approximately $115 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. In the Consumer Solutions segment, we expect our sales decrease in the consumer devices end market to be partially offset by a sales increase in the appliances end market in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.95 to $0.99 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $100 million and $0.03 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, we expect net sales to be between $14.7 billion and $15.3 billion. This primarily reflects sales increases in the Transportation Solutions and Network Solutions segments and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment from fiscal 2014 levels. In the Transportation Solutions segment, we expect our sales growth to outpace an anticipated 2.5% to 3% growth in global automotive production from fiscal 2014 levels. We expect Measurement Specialties to contribute approximately $600 million in sales to the Transportation Solutions segment in fiscal 2015. In the Network Solutions segment, we expect our sales to increase approximately 10% in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, with growth driven by a sales increase of approximately $300 million in the subsea communications end market. In the Industrial Solutions segment, we expect our sales to increase in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014, due primarily to increased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market. In the Consumer Solutions segment, we expect our sales decrease in the consumer devices end market to be offset by a sales increase in the appliances end market in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. We 33 Table of Contents expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.99 to $4.29 per share in fiscal 2015. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $400 million and $0.15 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels. We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. We also are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources." Acquisitions On October 9, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Measurement Specialties, a leading global designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensor-based systems, for $86 in cash per share. The total value paid, which included the repayment of debt, was approximately $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired. Measurement Specialties offers a broad portfolio of technologies including pressure, vibration, force, temperature, humidity, ultrasonics, position, and fluid sensors, for a wide range of applications and industries. This business will be reported as part of our Transportation Solutions segment. See additional information regarding the acquisition of Measurement Specialties in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2014, we acquired six companies, including SEACON, a leading provider of underwater connector technology and systems, for $528 million in cash, net of cash acquired. On April 3, 2012, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Deutsch for a total value paid of 1.55 billion (approximately $2.05 billion using an exchange rate of $1.33 per 1.00), net of cash acquired. The total value paid included $659 million related to the repayment of Deutsch's financial debt and accrued interest. The acquired Deutsch businesses have been reported in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments from the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2012, Deutsch contributed net sales of $327 million and an operating loss of $54 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The operating loss included charges of $75 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments related primarily to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, acquisition costs of $21 million, restructuring charges of $14 million, and integration costs of $6 million. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Deutsch acquisition. Restructuring We are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth. In connection with these initiatives and in response to market conditions, we incurred net restructuring charges of $63 million during fiscal 2014 and expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately $65 million during fiscal 2015, including $15 million associated with the integration of Measurement Specialties. Cash spending related to restructuring was $160 million during fiscal 2014, and we expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $105 million in fiscal 2015. Annualized cost savings related to actions commenced in fiscal 2014 are estimated to be approximately $30 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2016. Annualized cost savings related to actions commenced in fiscal 2013 are estimated to be approximately $115 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2015. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. 34 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2012, we sold our Touch Solutions and TE Professional Services businesses. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Results of Operations Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this report include: Raw material prices. We purchased approximately 173 million pounds of copper, 127,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.6 million troy ounces of silver in fiscal 2014. Prices continue to fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, and silver. Fiscal Measure 2014 2013 2012 Copper Lb. $ 3.29 $ 3.51 $ 3.90 Gold Troy oz. $ 1,405 $ 1,613 $ 1,599 Silver Troy oz. $ 23.43 $ 29.18 $ 34.30 In fiscal 2015, we expect to purchase copper, gold, and silver in quantities similar to fiscal 2014 levels. Foreign exchange. Approximately 55% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2014 by major currencies invoiced was as follows: Currencies Percentage U.S. dollar 45 % Euro 30 Chinese renminbi 8 Japanese yen 6 All others 11 Total 100 % Consolidated Operations Net Sales. Net sales increased $632 million, or 4.8%, to $13,912 million in fiscal 2014 from $13,280 million in fiscal 2013. On an organic basis, net sales increased $617 million, or 4.6%, during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as increased net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment were partially offset by decreases in the Network Solutions and Consumer Solutions segments. Price erosion adversely affected organic sales by $257 million in fiscal 2014. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $21 million, or 0.2%, in fiscal 2014. Net sales were $13,280 million and $13,282 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. On an organic basis, net sales decreased $171 million, or 1.3%, in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 as increased net sales in the Transportation Solutions segment were more than offset by decreases in the Network Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Consumer Solutions segments. Price erosion adversely affected 35 Table of Contents organic sales by $207 million in fiscal 2013. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $115 million, or 0.9%, in fiscal 2013. Deutsch, which was acquired on April 3, 2012, contributed incremental net sales of $320 million during the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012. See further discussion of organic net sales below under "Results of Operations by Segment." The following table sets forth the percentage of our total net sales by geographic region: Fiscal 2014 2013 2012 EMEA 35 % 34 % 34 % Asia Pacific 33 33 34 Americas 32 33 32 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by geographic region: Fiscal 2014 2013 Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Organic (1) Translation (2) Acquisitions (Divestitures) Total Organic (1) Translation (2) Acquisition (Divestiture) Total ($ in millions) EMEA $ 219 4.8 % $ 149 $ (6 ) $ 362 7.9 % $ (114 ) (2.5 )% $ 28 $ 146 $ 60 1.3 % Asia Pacific 337 7.8 (76 ) (34 ) 227 5.2 (31 ) (0.7 ) (113 ) (7 ) (151 ) (3.4 ) Americas 61 1.4 (52 ) 34 43 1.0 (26 ) (0.6 ) (30 ) 145 89 2.1 Total $ 617 4.6 % $ 21 $ (6 ) $ 632 4.8 % $ (171 ) (1.3 )% $ (115 ) $ 284 $ (2 ) % (1) Represents the change in net sales resulting from volume and price changes, before consideration of acquisitions, divestitures, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Gross margin increased $363 million to $4,692 million in fiscal 2014 from gross margin of $4,329 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from improved manufacturing productivity and, to a lesser degree, higher volume, partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33.7% during fiscal 2014 as compared to 32.6% in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, gross margin was $4,329 million, reflecting a $283 million increase from gross margin of $4,046 million in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2012, gross margin included charges of $75 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments related primarily to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated with Deutsch. Excluding this item, gross margin increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to improved manufacturing productivity and, to a lesser degree, lower material costs, partially offset by price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.6% in fiscal 2013 from 30.5% in fiscal 2012. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $109 million to $1,882 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to $1,773 million in fiscal 2013. The increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels, partially offset by savings attributable to restructuring actions and a gain on the sale of real estate. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.5% in fiscal 2014 from 13.4% in fiscal 2013. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $88 million to $1,773 million in fiscal 2013 from $1,685 million in fiscal 2012. The increase resulted primarily from additional selling, general, and administrative expenses of Deutsch, increased incentive compensation costs, and impairment charges on certain assets held for sale, partially offset by savings attributable to restructuring actions. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.4% in fiscal 2013 from 12.7% in fiscal 2012. Acquisition and Integration Costs. In fiscal 2014, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $31 million, primarily in connection with the acquisition of SEACON. In connection with the acquisition of Deutsch, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $14 million and $27 million during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. Net restructuring and other charges were $59 million, $311 million, and $128 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. During fiscal 2014, we initiated a restructuring program associated primarily with headcount reductions and manufacturing site and product line closures in the Network Solutions and Consumer Solutions segments. During fiscal 37 Table of Contents 2013, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures impacting all segments. During fiscal 2012, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce headcount across all segments. Also, we initiated a restructuring program in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments associated with the acquisition of Deutsch. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges. Operating Income. Operating income was $2,045 million, $1,556 million, and $1,518 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Results for fiscal 2014 included $59 million of net restructuring and other charges, $31 million of acquisition and integration charges, and $4 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments. Results for fiscal 2013 included $311 million of net restructuring and other charges and $14 million of acquisition and integration costs. Results for fiscal 2012 included $116 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch, including $75 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments related primarily to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, $27 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $14 million of net restructuring and other charges. Results for fiscal 2012 also included $114 million of additional net restructuring and other charges. Non-Operating Items Interest Expense. Interest expense was $131 million, $142 million, and $176 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The decrease of $11 million in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 was due to a lower average cost of debt. The decrease of $34 million in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 resulted from lower average debt levels. Other Income (Expense), Net. In fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, we recorded net other income of $63 million, net other expense of $183 million, and net other income of $50 million, respectively, primarily pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. The net other income in fiscal 2014 included $18 million of income related to our share of a settlement agreement entered into by Tyco International with a former subsidiary, CIT Group Inc., which arose from a pre-separation claim for which we were entitled to 31% once resolved. The net other expense in fiscal 2013 included $231 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes. Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation. We recorded income tax expense of $207 million, benefit of $29 million, and expense of $249 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The tax provision for fiscal 2014 reflects income tax benefits of $282 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with certain ADC tax loss carryforwards, partially offset by an income tax charge related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns. In fiscal 2014, we acquired SEACON, and its U.S. operations were combined with our ADC U.S. federal consolidated tax group. In addition, the ADC U.S. tax group was combined with other U.S. legal entities and assets. We reassessed the realization of the revised ADC U.S. tax group's tax loss and credit carryforwards. Based upon management's review of forecasted future taxable income of the reorganized combined tax group, we believe it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized on additional U.S. federal and state net operating losses. Accordingly, we reduced the valuation 38 Table of Contents allowance and recorded a tax benefit of $282 million. As of fiscal year end 2014, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of $75 million related to U.S. federal and state tax attributes of the ADC U.S. tax group due to uncertainty of their realization in the future. The tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects an income tax benefit of $331 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000. In addition, the tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects $23 million of net tax benefits consisting primarily of income tax benefits recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with certain ADC tax loss carryforwards and income tax benefits recognized in connection with the lapse of statutes of limitations for examinations of prior year income tax returns, partially offset by income tax expense related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns. The tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects an income tax benefit of $107 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations. In addition, the tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects $17 million of income tax expense associated with certain non-U.S. tax rate changes enacted in the quarter ended December 30, 2011. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,721 million and $1,816 million at fiscal year end 2014 and 2013, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Furthermore, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 26, 2014, certain subsidiaries had approximately $18 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by 39 Table of Contents such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. As of September 26, 2014, we had approximately $5.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to approximately $1.7 billion of tax expense would be recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes. During fiscal 2012, we sold our Touch Solutions business for net cash proceeds of $380 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction. The agreement includes contingent earn-out provisions through 2015 based on business performance. In connection with the divestiture, we incurred an income tax charge of $65 million, which is included in loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2012. This charge was driven primarily by the inability to fully realize a tax benefit associated with the write-off of goodwill at the time of the sale. During fiscal 2012, we sold our TE Professional Services business for net cash proceeds of $28 million and recognized an insignificant pre-tax gain on the transaction. Additionally, during fiscal 2012, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $28 million, which is included in loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of this business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. In December 2011, the New York Court of Claims entered judgment in our favor in the amount of $25 million, payment of which was received in fiscal 2012, in connection with our former Wireless Systems business's State of New York contract. This judgment resolved all outstanding issues between the parties in this matter. This partial recovery of a previously recognized loss, net of legal fees, is reflected in loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2012. The Touch Solutions, TE Professional Services, and Wireless Systems businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and have been included as such in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the Touch Solutions and TE Professional Services businesses were included in the former Communications and Industrial Solutions segment and the Network Solutions segment, respectively. The Wireless Systems business was a component of the former Wireless Systems segment. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $250 million of 1.60% senior notes due in February 2015. We may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law, to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares, or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines. On October 9, 2014, we acquired Measurement Specialties. The total value paid, which included the repayment of debt, was approximately $1.7 billion, net of cash acquired. In anticipation of the acquisition, we had previously raised funds through the issuance of $1 billion of senior notes. See additional information regarding debt and the acquisition of Measurement Specialties in Notes 11 and 24, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. As of September 26, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax costs. We provide for tax liabilities on our Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of September 26, 2014, we had approximately $5.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, and TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that up to approximately $1.7 billion of tax expense would be recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities. 47 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $47 million to $2,095 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to $2,048 million in fiscal 2013. The increase resulted from higher income levels, partially offset by higher accounts receivable levels and net payments made in relation to pre-separation tax matters. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,048 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to $1,888 million in fiscal 2012. The increase of $160 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 resulted primarily from higher income levels. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 were $93 million, $98 million, and $98 million, respectively. We expect pension and postretirement benefit contributions to be $84 million in fiscal 2015, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. There were no voluntary pension contributions in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $283 million, $312 million, and $290 million, respectively. In fiscal 2013 and 2012, these payments included $67 million and $70 million, respectively, for tax deficiencies related to pre-separation tax matters. Also during fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, we made net payments of $179 million and received net reimbursements of $39 million and $51 million, respectively, from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation U.S. tax matters. We expect to make net cash payments related to pre-separation U.S. tax matters of approximately $31 million over the next twelve months. These amounts include payments in which we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities and for which we expect a portion to be reimbursed by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement as well as indemnification payments to Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement for tax matters where they are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to pre-separation tax matters. In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. Free cash flow was $1,730 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to $1,500 million in fiscal 2013 and $1,434 million in fiscal 2012. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by higher income levels and increased proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by higher accounts receivable levels. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by higher income levels, partially offset by higher capital expenditures as reduced by proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow. Fiscal 2014 2013 2012 (in millions) Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 2,095 $ 2,048 $ 1,888 Capital expenditures (673 ) (615 ) (533 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment 129 39 23 Payments related to pre-separation U.S. tax matters, net 179 28 19 Payments related to accrued interest on debt assumed in the acquisition of Deutsch 17 Payments to settle acquisition-related foreign currency derivative contracts 20 Free cash flow $ 1,730 $ 1,500 $ 1,434 48 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Capital expenditures were $673 million, $615 million, and $533 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. We expect fiscal 2015 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment for fiscal 2014 included approximately $100 million related to the sale of real estate. During fiscal 2014, we acquired six companies for $528 million in cash, net of cash acquired. During fiscal 2012, we acquired Deutsch. The total value paid for the transaction amounted to 1.55 billion (approximately $2.05 billion using an exchange rate of $1.33 per 1.00), net of cash acquired of $152 million. The total value paid included $659 million of debt assumed, including accrued interest, which we paid off in its entirety shortly after the completion of the acquisition. See additional information in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2012, we received net cash proceeds of $370 million related to the sale of our Touch Solutions business and $24 million related to the sale of our TE Professional Services business. An additional $14 million of cash proceeds was received during fiscal 2013. See additional information in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization Total debt at fiscal year end 2014 and 2013 was $3,948 million and $3,014 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. In July 2014, TEGSA, our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due January 29, 2016, $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.35% senior notes due August 1, 2019, and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% senior notes due August 1, 2024. The senior floating rate notes due 2016 bear interest at a rate of three-month London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.20% per year. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes in July 2014, the commitments of the lenders under a $1 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of June 27, 2014, automatically terminated. During November 2013, TEGSA redeemed all of its outstanding 5.95% senior notes due 2014, representing $300 million principal amount. We paid an immaterial premium in connection with the early redemption. In addition, during November 2013, TEGSA issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of 2.375% senior notes due December 17, 2018. The notes issued in July 2014 and November 2013 are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment on an unsecured senior basis by TE Connectivity Ltd. TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in August 2013 primarily to extend the maturity date from June 2016 to August 2018 and reduce borrowing costs. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 26, 2014 and September 27, 2013. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Deutsche Bank AG New York branch's base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of 49 Table of Contents TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 7.5 to 25.0 basis points based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA. The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 26, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. Neither TE Connectivity Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries provides a guarantee as to payment obligations under the 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2015 issued by ADC prior to its acquisition in December 2010. Payments of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $443 million, $384 million, and $332 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. In March 2011, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.68 (equivalent to $0.72) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We paid the third and fourth installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.18 per share during the quarters ended December 30, 2011 and March 30, 2012, respectively. In March 2012, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.80 (equivalent to $0.84) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 through the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We paid the installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.21 per share during each of the quarters ended June 29, 2012, September 28, 2012, December 28, 2012 and March 29, 2013. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28) to CHF 0.57 (equivalent to $0.44). In March 2013, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.96 (equivalent to $1.00) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 through the second quarter of fiscal 2014. We paid the installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.25 per share during each of the quarters ended June 28, 2013, September 27, 2013, December 27, 2013, and March 28, 2014. In March 2014, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 1.04 (equivalent to $1.16) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 through the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We paid the first and second installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.29 per share during the quarters ended June 27, 2014 and September 26, 2014, respectively. Future dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. 50 Table of Contents During fiscal 2014, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1 billion in the share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 11 million of our common shares for $604 million, approximately 20 million of our common shares for $829 million, and approximately 6 million of our common shares for $194 million during fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. At September 26, 2014, we had $874 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2014: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter (in millions) Long-term debt, including current maturities $ 3,948 $ 667 $ 500 $ $ 723 $ 574 $ 1,484 Interest on long-term debt (1) 1,333 141 135 132 109 82 734 Operating leases 394 125 85 56 40 32 56 Purchase obligations (2) 307 272 22 13 Total contractual cash obligations (3)(4)(5) $ 5,982 $ 1,205 $ 742 $ 201 $ 872 $ 688 $ 2,274 (1) Interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. (2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (3) The table above does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of $1,597 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $1,136 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties. (4) The table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $84 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2015, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Other long-term liabilities of $332 million are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, the proceedings discussed below in "Income Tax Matters" could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. 51 Table of Contents At September 26, 2014, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the State of Florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time. Income Tax Matters In connection with the separation from Tyco International in 2007, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of Covidien to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. Prior to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined income tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Tyco International's and Covidien's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees also have been recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent Reports that reflected the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. The penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was distributed to us in connection with the separation. Tyco International appealed certain of the proposed 52 Table of Contents adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000, and Tyco International resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments, including reaching an agreement with the IRS on the penalty adjustment in the amount of $21 million. In October 2012, the IRS issued special agreement Forms 870-AD, effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000, excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below. As a result of these developments, in fiscal 2013, we recognized an income tax benefit of $331 million, representing a reduction in tax reserves for the matters that were effectively settled, and other expense of $231 million, representing a reduction of associated indemnification receivables, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. The disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately $2.7 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on Tyco International's U.S. income tax returns. In addition, if the IRS is ultimately successful in asserting its claim, it is likely to disallow an additional $6.6 billion of interest deductions reflected on U.S. income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000. Tyco International contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for U.S. tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate. The IRS and Tyco International were unable to resolve this matter through the IRS appeals process. On June 20, 2013, Tyco International advised us that it had received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS for certain former U.S. subsidiaries of Tyco International increasing taxable income by approximately $2.9 billion in connection with the audit of Tyco International's fiscal years 1997 through 2000. The Notices of Deficiency assert that Tyco International owes additional taxes totaling $778 million, associated penalties of $154 million, and withholding taxes of $105 million. In addition, Tyco International received Final Partnership Administrative Adjustments for certain U.S. partnerships owned by former U.S. subsidiaries with respect to which Tyco International estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately $30 million will be asserted. The amounts asserted by the IRS exclude any applicable deficiency interest, and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that the IRS were to prevail on some or all of its assertions. We understand that Tyco International strongly disagrees with the IRS position and has filed petitions in the U.S. Tax Court contesting the IRS' proposed adjustments. Tyco International has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing U.S. Treasury regulations. A U.S. Tax Court trial date of February 29, 2016 has been set and the parties are engaged in discovery. TE does not expect any payments to the IRS with respect to these matters until they are fully and finally resolved. In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien would share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of any payments made in connection with these matters. If the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, our share of the assessed tax, deficiency interest, and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We have reviewed the Notices of Deficiency, the relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions, relevant tax regulations, and applicable case law, and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter. During fiscal 2014, we made net payments of $179 million related to pre-separation tax matters, including $198 million of indemnification payments made to Tyco International and Covidien in connection with their advanced payments for expected deficiencies made to the IRS for the 2005 through 2007 audit cycle. We made net payments of $28 million and $19 million related to pre-separation tax matters during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. 53 Table of Contents Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 remain subject to adjustment by the IRS upon ultimate resolution of the disputed issue involving certain intercompany loans originated during the period 1997 through 2000. For the undisputed issues for years 2001 through 2004, it is our understanding that Tyco International expects to receive and accept general agreement Forms 870 from the IRS during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The IRS commenced its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011, and it is our understanding that Tyco International expects the IRS to issue general agreement Forms 870 during the first half of fiscal 2015. Over the next twelve months, we expect to make net cash payments of approximately $31 million in connection with pre-separation U.S. tax matters. During fiscal 2012, the IRS commenced its audit of our income tax returns for the years 2008 through 2010. We expect fieldwork for the 2008 through 2010 audit to conclude in fiscal 2015. At September 26, 2014 and September 27, 2013, we have reflected $51 million and $15 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities related to the audits of Tyco International's and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within the next twelve months. We believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2015 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At September 26, 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds in the amount of $408 million. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities 54 Table of Contents settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements were valued upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees . At September 26, 2014, we had a liability representing the indemnifications made to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement of $21 million recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition . Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales. Contract revenues for construction related projects, which are generated in the Network Solutions segment, are recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Acquired intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, as well as customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinable-lived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess determinable-lived intangible assets for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets for impairment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from determinable-lived intangible assets by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management 55 Table of Contents relies on a number of reporting-unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors to the goodwill impairment analysis. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2014, we had seven reporting units, six of which contained goodwill. There is one reporting unit in the Transportation Solutions segment and two reporting units in each of the Industrial Solutions, Network Solutions, and Consumer Solutions segments. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure. When testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . First, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Fair value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses (a market approach). These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and determined that no impairment existed. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and non-U.S. pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. 56 Table of Contents We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Furthermore, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These 57 Table of Contents assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2014, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $140 million; a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by $125 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2014 pension expense by $10 million. During fiscal 2012, our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from a previous target of 30% equity and 70% fixed income to 10% equity and 90% fixed income in an effort to better protect the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the funded status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("the Pension Act Funded Status"), of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. We expect to reach our target allocation when the Pension Act Funded Status exceeds 100%. Based on the Pension Act Funded Status as of September 26, 2014, our target asset allocation is 44% equity and 56% fixed income. Acquisitions We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, or as required by ASC 805, Business Combinations . The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships, acquired developed technologies, and patents; expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed; brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio; customer and distributor attrition rates; royalty rates; and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Contingent Liabilities We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided. 58 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Organic Net Sales Growth Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. We believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in "Results of Operations" above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and free cash flow (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. Free cash flow is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, minus net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related 59 Table of Contents to pre-separation tax matters, also are considered by management in evaluating free cash flow. We believe investors also should consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow. Free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our GAAP cash flow. Also, it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the board of directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow results. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow. The tables presented in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under GAAP.
