Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this 2018 Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management\\'s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under Part I, Item 1 Business and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors , as well as Forward-Looking Statements discussed earlier in this 2018 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Introduction WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\") focuses primarily on providing government-sponsored managed care services to families, children, seniors and individuals with complex medical needs, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare Advantage (\"MA\") and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans (\"PDP\"), as well as individuals in the Health Insurance Marketplace. As of December 31, 2018 , we served approximately 5.5 million members. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 , we operated Medicaid health plans, including states where we receive Medicaid premium revenues associated with dually eligible special needs plans, in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina and Texas. As of December 31, 2018 , we operated MA coordinated care plans (\"CCPs\") in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, as well as stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans (\"PDP\") nationwide. We began serving Medicaid and Medicare members in Arizona, effective December 31, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Care1st Health Plan Arizona, Inc. and One Care by Care1st Health Plan of Arizona, Inc. (together \"Care1st Arizona\"). Effective January 1, 2017, we began serving Medicaid members statewide in Nebraska. In connection with the acquisition of Meridian Health Plan of Michigan, Inc., Meridian Health Plan of Illinois, Inc., and MeridianRx, a pharmacy benefit manager (\"PBM\") (collectively, Meridian ) we began serving Medicaid and Medicare members in Michigan, as well as MA members in Indiana and Ohio. Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Summarized below are the key financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2018 . For additional information, refer to the \"Results of Operations\" section, which discusses both consolidated and segment results. Membership increased by 1,167,000 members, or 26.7% , in 2018 compared with 2017 , as discussed below in \" Results of Operations .\" The growth was primarily driven by our September 2018 acquisition of Meridian, as well as organic growth in our Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare Health Plans segments. These increases were partially offset by decreased membership in our Medicare PDP segment resulting from our 2018 bid positioning. Premiums increased $3.2 billion , or 18.8% , in 2018 compared with 2017 , primarily reflecting our acquisitions of Meridian in September 2018 and Universal American in April 2017. The increase is also attributed to the assignment of additional members in our Illinois Medicaid health plan, effective January 1, 2018, participation in the Missouri Medicaid program expansion, effective May 1, 2017, organic growth in our Medicare Health Plans segment and the expiration of the 2017 ACA industry fee moratorium (discussed in Key Development and Accomplishments below), which reestablished the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners for 2018. These increases were partially offset by the previously discussed membership declines in our PDP segment. Net Income increased $66.1 million , or 17.7% , in 2018 compared with 2017 driven by continued improvement in operational execution across all of our segments, the acquisition of Universal American in April 2017 and the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\"), which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. These increases are partially offset by the favorable effect of revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017 as a result of the TCJA, the expiration of the 2017 ACA industry fee moratorium and reestablishment of the ACA industry fee for 2018, which is nondeductible for tax purposes. 51 Table of Contents Key Developments and Accomplishments Presented below are key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our business strategy that have affected, or are expected to affect, our results: In February 2019, we received notice from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) that we were awarded a contract to administer the state Medicaid Prepaid Health Plans, which is subject to a protest process. DHHS has selected four health plans, including us, to serve North Carolina\\'s Medicaid beneficiaries on a statewide basis. One additional health plan led by providers was selected to operate health plans in certain regions. The state is expected to implement the new managed care program, in two phases, for its 1.6 million Medicaid beneficiaries beginning November 1, 2019. In November 2018, we completed the asset purchase of Aetna Inc.\\'s (\"Aetna\") entire standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan membership (\"Aetna Part D membership\"), which Aetna divested as part of CVS Health Corporation\\'s acquisition of Aetna, for total approximate consideration of $107.2 million in cash, which is subject to certain true-up provisions. Per the terms of the agreements, Aetna will provide administrative services to, and retain financial risk of, the Aetna Part D membership through 2019. Therefore, the Aetna Part D membership will be excluded from our membership and results of operations until January 1, 2020. In September 2018, we completed the acquisition of Meridian for approximately $2.5 billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. As a result of this transaction, we expanded our Medicaid portfolio through the addition of Michigan, where Meridian has the leading market position; expanded our Medicaid presence in Illinois; and acquired an integrated PBM platform. Meridian also serves MA members in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, as well as Health Insurance Marketplace members in Michigan. In August 2018, we completed a public offering and issuance of 5,207,547 shares of our common stock, at an offering price of $ 265.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.3 billion , after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs of $ 37.7 million . We used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of Meridian. In August 2018, we completed the offering and sale of 5.375% unsecured senior notes due 2026 in the aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million (the 2026 Notes\"). The aggregate net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes were $739.0 million, which were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our acquisition of Meridian. In August 2018, $225.0 million was drawn on our Revolving Credit Facility to partially fund the Meridian acquisition, of which $25.0 million was repaid during September 2018. As of December 31, 2018, $200.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. In July 2018, we entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement ( Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ), which increased the aggregate principle amount available under our Revolving Credit Facility from $ 1.0 billion to $ 1.3 billion . Additionally, we extended the maturity date under the Revolving Credit Facility from January 2021 to July 2023. In July 2018, we received a Notice of Intent to Award a contract from the Florida Department of Health to provide statewide-managed care services to more than 60,000 children with medically complex conditions through the Children\\'s Medical Services Managed Care Plan (\"CMS Plan\"). The five-year contract award began on February 1, 2019; however, this contract is still subject to protest and appeal. Additionally, in April 2018, we received a Notice of Agency Decision from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration ( AHCA ) to award our subsidiary, Staywell, a new five-year contract to provide managed care services to Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries, including Managed Medical Assistance and Long-Term Care beneficiaries in 10 of 11 regions. As part of the Medicaid Managed Care program, we expect to provide statewide managed care services to beneficiaries in the Serious Mental Illness Specialty Plan (\"SMI\"), which currently has more than 75,000 beneficiaries statewide. We are one of two managed care plans providing services to the SMI beneficiaries. The new statewide Medicaid Managed Care program began on December 1, 2018. In March 2018, we announced that our Arizona subsidiary, Care1st Health Plan Arizona, Inc., was selected to enter into a contract with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (\"AHCCCS\") to coordinate the provision of physical and behavioral healthcare services in the Central and North geographic service areas (\"GSAs\"). Under the 52 Table of Contents new program, health plans were eligible to be awarded two of the three GSAs. Services under the new contract began on October 1, 2018. The initial term of the contract with AHCCCS is three years. The parties may extend the term upon mutual consent for up to two additional two-year terms. Effective January 1, 2017, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided for a one-year moratorium on the ACA industry fee, which also eliminated the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners. This 2017 moratorium expired effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, we incurred $344.1 million of ACA industry fee expense for 2018. We did not incur ACA industry fee expense for 2017. Additionally, we recognized $302.2 million in Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue for 2018. We did not receive any Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue during 2017.

Refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. 53 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results The following table sets forth condensed data from our consolidated statements of operations data, as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussions for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Revenues: (Dollars in millions) Premium $ 20,146.3 $ 16,960.3 $ 14,220.9 Products and services 154.1 Investment and other income 113.7 46.9 16.2 Total revenues 20,414.1 17,007.2 14,237.1 Expenses and other: Medical benefits 17,128.1 14,744.8 12,089.4 Costs of products and services 148.6 Selling, general and administrative 1,701.0 1,484.7 1,133.1 ACA industry fee 344.1 228.4 Medicaid premium taxes 126.8 119.8 110.0 Depreciation and amortization 179.7 120.4 87.6 Interest 87.5 68.5 59.1 Total expenses, net 19,715.8 16,538.2 13,707.6 Income from operations 698.3 469.0 529.5 Loss on extinguishment of debt 26.1 Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 698.3 442.9 529.5 Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries (5.5 ) 18.7 Income before income taxes 692.8 461.6 529.5 Income tax expense 253.0 87.9 287.4 Net income $ 439.8 $ 373.7 $ 242.1 Effective tax rate 36.5 % 19.0 % 54.3 % Membership by Segment Medicaid Health Plans 3,931,000 2,723,000 2,544,000 Medicare Health Plans 545,000 496,000 345,000 Medicare PDPs 1,057,000 1,152,000 1,009,000 Total Membership by Segment 5,533,000 4,371,000 3,898,000 Health Insurance Marketplace 5,000 Total Membership 5,538,000 4,371,000 3,898,000 54 Table of Contents Membership 2018 vs. 2017 As of December 31, 2018 , membership increased approximately 1,167,000 , or 26.7% , compared with December 31, 2017 . Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans. Membership increased by 1,208,000 , or 44.4% , to 3.9 million members as of December 31, 2018 .The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Meridian, as well as organic membership growth primarily in our Illinois Medicaid health plan as a result of a new contract with the Illinois Department of Health Care and Family Services (\"HFS\") to administer the Health Choice Illinois Medicaid managed care program statewide, effective January 1, 2018. Medicare Health Plans. Membership increased by 49,000 , or 9.9% , to 545,000 members as of December 31, 2018 . The increase is partially a result of the acquisition of Meridian, which expanded our membership through the addition of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, as well as deepened our presence in Illinois. Additionally, the increase reflects our organic growth. Medicare PDPs. Membership decreased by 95,000 , or 8.2% , to 1.1 million members as of December 31, 2018 . The decrease was primarily the result of our 2018 bid positioning. Our 2018 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below CMS benchmarks in 25 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in five other regions, compared with our 2017 bids, in which we were below the benchmarks in 30 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in three other regions. 2017 vs. 2016 As of December 31, 2017 , membership increased approximately 473,000, or 12.1%, compared with December 31, 2016 . Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans . Membership increased by 179,000, or 7.0%, to 2.7 million members as of December 31, 2017 . The increase was primarily driven by our participation in Missouri\\'s Medicaid program statewide expansion, our new Nebraska Medicaid plan, and membership acquired from Phoenix Health Plan in our Arizona market. The increase was partially offset by declines in our Georgia health plan membership because the State added a fourth managed care organization, effective July 1, 2017. Medicare Health Plans . Membership increased by 151,000, or 43.8%, to 496,000 members as of December 31, 2017 . The increase primarily reflects our acquisition of Universal American, our 2017 bid positioning and continued execution on sales and retention initiatives, partially offset by planned service area reductions for the 2017 plan year. Medicare PDPs . Membership increased by 143,000, or 14.2%, to 1.2 million members as of December 31, 2017 . The increase was primarily the result of our 2017 bid positioning. Our 2017 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 30 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in three other regions. Our 2016 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 17 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in nine other regions. Net income 2018 vs. 2017 For the year ended December 31, 2018 , our net income increased by $66.1 million , or 17.7% , compared with the same period in 2017 driven by continued improvement in operational execution across all of our segments, the acquisitions of Universal American in April 2017 and the effect of the TCJA, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 (discussed in Note 14 - Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements of this 2018 Form 10-K). These increases are partially offset by the expiration of the 2017 ACA industry fee moratorium and reestablishment of the ACA industry fee for 2018, which is nondeductible for tax purposes and the favorable effect of revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017 as a result of the TCJA. Refer to Segment Reporting below for a discussion of current developments, operating results and other key performance measures by reportable segment. 55 Table of Contents 2017 vs. 2016 For the year ended December 31, 2017 , our net income increased by $131.6 million, or 54.4%, compared with the same period in 2016 driven by continued improvement in operational execution, primarily in the Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare Health Plans segments, as well as the acquisitions of Universal American and Care1st Arizona. The increase is also attributed to the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017, the effect of the TCJA, and the recognition of certain earnings related to unconsolidated subsidiaries. These increases are partially offset by $37.5 million in one-time transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Universal American, and a $26.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the early redemption, on April 7, 2017, of our 2020 Notes. Premium revenue 2018 vs. 2017 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 , increased approximately $3.2 billion , or 18.8% , compared with the same period in 2017 , reflecting our acquisitions of Meridian in September 2018 and Universal American in April 2017, the assignment of additional members in our Illinois Medicaid health plan, organic growth in our Medicare Health Plans segment and the expiration of the 2017 ACA industry fee moratorium, which reestablished the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners for 2018 as discussed in \" Key Developments and Accomplishments. \" These increases were partially offset by the previously discussed membership declines in our Medicare PDP segment. 2017 vs. 2016 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased $2.7 billion , or 19.3% , from 2016 compared with the same period in 2016 , reflecting our acquisitions of Universal American and Care1st Arizona, our participation in the Missouri Medicaid program expansion, net rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets, and organic growth across all three lines of business. These increases were partially offset by the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017, which resulted in the elimination of any associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners. Medical benefits expense 2018 vs. 2017 Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 , increased $2.4 billion , or 16.2% , from 2017 primarily driven by the previously noted 2018 and 2017 acquisitions, the assignment of additional members in our Illinois Medicaid health plan and additional organic membership growth in our Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare Health Plans segments. The increases were partially offset by the previously discussed membership declines in our Medicare PDP segment and the favorable result of continued performance in clinical and pharmacy execution. 2017 vs. 2016 Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased $2.7 billion , or 22.0% , primarily driven by the previously noted 2017 and 2016 acquisitions, our participation in the Missouri Medicaid program expansion, and additional organic membership growth across all lines of business. The increase was partially offset by the favorable result of continued performance in clinical and pharmacy execution. 56 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\") SG&A expense, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), includes aggregate costs related to previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation and resolution costs (\"Investigation costs\"). Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies within the consolidated financial statements included in this 2018 Form 10-K for additional discussion of these Investigation costs. SG&A expense also included certain costs associated with our 2018 acquisitions of Meridian and Aetna Part D membership as well as the 2017 acquisition of Universal American (\"Transaction and integration costs\"); certain activities relating to the divestiture of Sterling Life Insurance Company (\"Sterling divestiture costs\"), our prior Medicare Supplement business; transitory costs related to our decision to change our pharmacy benefit manager (\"PBM\") as of January 1, 2016 (\"PBM transitory costs\"); and certain non-recurring Iowa related SG&A expenses relating to readiness costs, certain wind-down costs of WellCare\\'s Iowa operations and certain legal costs (\"Iowa SG&A costs\"). Although the above items may recur, we believe that by providing non-GAAP measurements exclusive of these items, we facilitate period-over-period comparisons and provide additional clarity about events and trends affecting our core operating performance, as well as providing comparability to competitor results. The Investigation costs are related to a discrete incident, which we do not expect to re-occur. The other costs mentioned above are related to specific events, which do not reflect the underlying ongoing performance of our business. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of SG&A expense, including and excluding such costs, is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) SG&A expense $ 1,701.0 $ 1,484.7 $ 1,133.1 Adjustments: Investigation costs (0.4 ) (7.9 ) (16.0 ) Transaction and integration costs (33.1 ) (37.5 ) Sterling divestiture costs (1.7 ) PBM transitory costs (4.9 ) Iowa SG&A costs (5.2 ) Adjusted SG&A Expense $ 1,667.5 $ 1,439.3 $ 1,105.3 SG&A ratio (1) (3) 8.3 % 8.7 % 8.0 % Adjusted SG&A ratio (2) (3) 8.3 % 8.5 % 8.0 % (1) SG&A expense, as a percentage of total revenues. (2) Adjusted SG&A expense, as a percentage of total revenue, excluding Medicaid premium tax reimbursement and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement. Because reimbursements for Medicaid premium tax and ACA industry fee are both included in the premium rates or reimbursement established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these reimbursements from total revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that these components are not indicative of operating performance. (3) Effective January 1, 2018, the Company redefined our SG&A ratio (GAAP) to be a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted SG&A ratio was redefined to be a percentage of total revenues excluding Medicaid premium tax reimbursement and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement. Accordingly, results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were adjusted to conform to this presentation, which decreased our SG&A ratio (GAAP) by 0.1% and 0.0% for each year, respectively. Adjusted SG&A ratio was unaffected for each year. 57 Table of Contents 2018 vs. 2017 Our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 , increased approximately $216.3 million , or 14.6% , compared with the same period in 2017 , primarily reflecting our 2018 acquisition of Meridian, staffing and infrastructure costs to support organic growth, our 2017 acquisition of Universal American and variable management incentive compensation due to improved company performance. Our SG&A ratio decreased by 40 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017 , primarily reflecting the expiration of the 2017 ACA industry fee moratorium, which reestablished the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners for 2018, continued improvements in operating efficiency, and lower year-over-year transaction and integration costs; partially offset by higher variable management incentive compensation in 2018. Our Adjusted SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 , increased approximately $228.2 million , or 15.9% , compared with the same period in 2017 , primarily reflecting our 2018 acquisition of Meridian, our 2017 acquisition of Universal American and variable management incentive compensation due to improved company performance. Our Adjusted SG&A ratio decreased by 20 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017 , primarily reflecting continued improvements in operating efficiency, partially offset by higher variable management incentive compensation in 2018. 2017 vs. 2016 Our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased approximately $351.6 million or 31.0% , compared with the same period in 2016 . Additionally, our SG&A ratio increased by 70 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 . These increases were primarily the result of our acquisitions of Universal American, including one-time transaction and integration costs, and Care1st Arizona, staffing and infrastructure costs to support organic growth, and variable management incentive compensation due to improved company performance. The increase in the SG&A ratio is also due to the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017, which resulted in the elimination of any associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners. Our Adjusted SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased approximately $334.0 million , or 30.2% , compared with the same period in 2016 . Additionally, our Adjusted SG&A ratio increased by 50 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 . These increases were primarily the result of our acquisitions of Universal American and Care1st Arizona as well as variable management incentive compensation due to improved company performance. ACA Industry Fee 2018 vs. 2017 Effective January 1, 2017, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided for a one-year moratorium on the ACA industry fee, which also eliminated the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners. This 2017 moratorium expired effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, we incurred $344.1 million for the ACA industry fee for the year ended December 31, 2018 . We did not incur ACA industry fee expense for 2017. 2017 vs. 2016 Due to the effect of the previously noted ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017 , we did not incur ACA industry fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with $228.4 million for the same period in 2016 . Loss on extinguishment of debt The loss on extinguishment of debt of $26.1 million primarily related to the early redemption of our $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% senior notes due 2020 Notes (the \"2020 Notes\") on April 7, 2017 (discussed further in Note 10 - Debt to the consolidated financial statements in this 2018 Form 10-K). In connection with the redemption we incurred a one-time loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption premium, the write-off of associated deferred financing costs and the write-off of the unamortized portion of associated premiums paid on the 2020 Notes. 58 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense 2018 vs. 2017 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 , increased $165.1 million , or 187.8% , compared with the same period in 2017 , while our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 , increased to 36.5% compared with 19.0% for the same period in 2017 . These increases were primarily driven by the favorable effect of revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017 as a result of the TCJA, the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits in 2017, and the effect of the nondeductible ACA industry fee incurred in 2018 as a result of the expiration of the 2017 ACA industry fee moratorium. These increases were partially offset by the effect of federal income tax rate decreases in 2018 associated with the TCJA. Refer to Note 14 - Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements in this 2018 Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits in 2017 and the current year tax effect of the TCJA. 2017 vs. 2016 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 , decreased $199.5 million , or 69.4% , compared with the same period in 2016 , while the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 , decreased to 19.0% compared with 54.3% for the same period in 2016 . The decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by the one-year moratorium on the non-deductible ACA industry fee for 2017, higher excess tax benefits resulting from the settlement of stock-compensation awards in 2017 and the favorable effect of the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits during 2017. The decrease is also related to the effect of revaluing the Company\\'s deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the TCJA. Segment Reporting Reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the enterprise\\'s decision makers to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments. Accordingly, we have three reportable segments: Medicaid Health Plans, Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs. Segment Financial Performance Measures Our primary measurements of profitability for our reportable segments are premium revenue, gross margin and MBR. Gross margin is defined as total revenues less investment and other income, medical benefits expense, costs of products and services, the ACA industry fee expense, and Medicaid premium tax expense. MBR measures the ratio of medical benefits expense to premium revenue. Our Adjusted MBR (non-GAAP) measures the ratio of medical benefits expense to premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes reimbursement and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement. We use gross margin, MBR and, where applicable, Adjusted MBR, to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense. These metrics are utilized to make various business decisions, including which health care plans to offer, which geographic areas to enter or exit and which health care providers to include in our networks. For further information regarding premium revenues and medical benefits expense, please refer below to \" Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable \" and \" Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable \" under \" Critical Accounting Estimates. \" 59 Table of Contents Reconciling Segment Results The following table reconciles our reportable segment results with our income from operations (before income taxes), as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Gross Margin (1) : (In millions) Medicaid Health Plans $ 1,478.4 $ 1,192.4 $ 1,052.8 Medicare Health Plans 856.6 742.9 533.9 Medicare PDPs 211.9 160.4 206.4 Corporate and other (2) 5.9 Total gross margin 2,552.8 2,095.7 1,793.1 Investment and other income 113.7 46.9 16.2 Other expenses, net (3) (1,968.2 ) (1,673.6 ) (1,279.8 ) Income from operations $ 698.3 $ 469.0 $ 529.5 (1) Effective January 1, 2018 , the Company redefined gross margin as total revenues less investment and other income, medical benefits expense, costs of products and services, the ACA industry fee expense, and Medicaid premium tax expense. Accordingly, results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were adjusted to include Medicaid premium taxes, which decreased gross margin by $119.8 million and $110.0 million , respectively. (2) Corporate and other category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles. (3) Effective January 1, 2018 , other expenses include SG&A expenses, depreciation, amortization and interest. Accordingly, results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were adjusted to exclude Medicaid premium taxes, which decreased other expenses by $119.8 million and $110.0 million , respectively. Medicaid Health Plans Our Medicaid Health Plans segment includes plans for beneficiaries of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (\"TANF\"), Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\"), Aged Blind and Disabled (\"ABD\") and other state-based programs that are not part of the Medicaid program, such as CHIP and the Long-Term Services and Supports (\"LTSS\") program. 60 Table of Contents Medicaid Health Plans Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicaid Health Plans segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Premium revenue (1) $ 12,563.8 10,606.5 9,144.4 Medicaid premium tax reimbursement (1) 126.8 119.8 110.0 Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement (1) 302.2 244.9 Total premiums 12,992.8 10,726.3 9,499.3 Medical benefits expense 11,171.3 9,414.1 8,188.5 Medicaid premium tax 126.8 119.8 110.0 ACA industry fee 216.3 148.0 Gross margin (2) $ 1,478.4 $ 1,192.4 $ 1,052.8 Medicaid Health Plans MBR (1) 86.0 % 87.8 % 86.2 % Effect of: Medicaid premium taxes 0.9 % 1.1 % 1.0 % Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement 2.0 % % 2.3 % Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR (1) 88.9 % 88.8 % 89.5 % Medicaid Health Plans Membership: Illinois 842,000 138,000 166,000 Florida 777,000 751,000 780,000 Michigan 500,000 Georgia 493,000 513,000 571,000 Kentucky 444,000 448,000 440,000 Other states (3) 875,000 873,000 587,000 3,931,000 2,723,000 2,544,000 (1) For GAAP reporting purposes, Medicaid premium tax reimbursement and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement are included in premium revenue to measure our MBR. Our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium tax reimbursement and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue. Because reimbursements for Medicaid premium tax and ACA industry fee are both included in the premium rates or reimbursement established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these reimbursements from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that these components are not indicative of operating performance. (2) Effective January 1, 2018 , the Company redefined gross margin as total revenues less investment and other income, medical benefits expense, costs of products and services, the ACA industry fee expense, and Medicaid premium tax expense. Accordingly, results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were adjusted to include Medicaid premium taxes, which decreased gross margin by $119.8 million and $110.0 million , respectively. (3) \"All other states\" consists of Arizona, Hawaii, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina and Texas. In 2017 and 2018, it also includes Nebraska. 61 Table of Contents 2018 vs. 2017 Medicaid total premiums increased $2.3 billion , or 21.1% , for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017, primarily driven by our September 2018 acquisition of Meridian; the expiration of the 2017 ACA industry fee moratorium, which reestablished the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners in 2018; the assignment of additional members in our Illinois Medicaid health plan, effective January 1, 2018; and net premium rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets. The increase is also attributable to organic growth in certain markets including Arizona, Missouri and New York, which are partially offset by eligibility decreases in certain of our Medicaid markets. The increases are also partially offset by lower average membership in our Georgia health plan due to the introduction of a fourth managed care organization in the State, effective July 1, 2017. Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, Medicaid premium revenue increased $2.0 billion , or 18.5% , for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017 . The increase is a result of our 2018 acquisition of Meridian, the assignment of additional members in our Illinois Medicaid health plan, effective January 1, 2018, and net premium rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets. The increases were partially offset by the lower Georgia membership and net eligibility decreases in certain of our Medicaid markets noted above. Medical benefits expense increased by approximately $1.8 billion , or 18.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, primarily resulting from the previously discussed acquisition of Meridian, the assignment of additional members in our Illinois Medicaid health plan, effective January 1, 2018, and organic growth in certain markets, including Arizona, Missouri and New York. These increases are partially offset by the previously discussed lower average membership in our Georgia health plan, eligibility decreases in certain of our Medicaid markets and the favorable result of continued performance in clinical and pharmacy execution. Our Medicaid Health Plans segment MBR decreased by 180 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017. The decrease is primarily a result of the expiration of the 2017 ACA industry fee moratorium, which reestablished the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners for 2018, net premium rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets and the favorable result of continued performance in clinical and pharmacy execution. Excluding the effect of Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR is consistent with the same period in 2017. 2017 vs. 2016 Medicaid total premiums increased $1.2 billion , or 12.9% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 , primarily driven by membership acquired from our Arizona acquisitions, our new Nebraska Medicaid plan and our participation in Missouri\\'s Medicaid program statewide expansion. The increase is also attributable to net rate increases in certain of our existing Medicaid markets. These increases were partially offset by the effect of the previously noted ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017, which resulted in the elimination of any associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners. Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, Medicaid premium revenue increased $1.5 billion , or 16.0% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 . The increase is a result of our previously discussed 2017 and 2016 Medicaid acquisitions, our new Nebraska Medicaid program and our participation in the Missouri Medicaid program statewide expansion. The increase is also attributable to net increases in certain of our existing Medicaid markets. Medical benefits expense increased by approximately $1.2 billion , or 15.0% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 , primarily resulting from the previously discussed net increase in membership, including growth from acquisitions and organic growth resulting from our new Nebraska market and Missouri\\'s statewide expansion. Our Medicaid Health Plans segment MBR increased by 160 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 . The increase is primarily a result of the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium, and, as a result the elimination of associated Medicaid reimbursement revenue, the addition of our new Medicaid businesses in Arizona and Nebraska, and new members from the statewide expansion of the Missouri Medicaid program. This increase was partially offset by continued operational execution and net rate increases in certain Medicaid markets. 62 Table of Contents Excluding the effect of Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR decreased by 70 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 . The decrease is primarily the result of continued operational execution and net rate increases in certain Medicaid markets, partially offset by the addition of our new Medicaid businesses in Arizona and Nebraska, and new members from the statewide expansion of the Missouri Medicaid program. Medicare Health Plans We contract with CMS under the Medicare program to provide a comprehensive array of Part C and Part D benefits to Medicare eligible persons provided through our MA plans. Our MA plans are comprised of CCPs, which are primarily administered through HMOs and generally require members to seek health care services and select a primary care physician from a network of health care providers. Certain MA CCPs are administered through PPOs and PFFS. In addition, we offer Medicare Part D coverage, which provides prescription drug benefits, as a component of most of our MA plans. In 2018 , we operated our MA CCPs in 524 counties across 21 states, including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. We cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our MA plans. For many of our plans, we provide additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare, such as vision, dental and hearing services. Through these enhanced benefits, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our members are generally reduced, which better allows our members to manage their health care costs. Medicare Health Plans Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare Health Plans segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 6,313.8 $ 5,320.2 $ 3,876.6 Medical benefits expense 5,347.8 4,577.3 3,278.5 ACA industry fee 109.4 64.2 Gross margin $ 856.6 $ 742.9 $ 533.9 Medicare Health Plans Membership 545,000 496,000 345,000 Medicare Health Plans MBR 84.7 % 86.0 % 84.6 % 2018 vs. 2017 Medicare Health Plans premium revenue increased by $1.0 billion , or 18.7% , for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017 , primarily driven by our 2018 bid strategy, organic growth, and the acquisitions of Meridian in September 2018 and Universal American in April 2017. Medicare Health Plans medical benefits expense increased $0.8 billion , or 16.8% , for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017 , primarily due to increased membership acquired from the acquisitions of Meridian in September 2018 and Universal American in April 2017, as well as organic growth in certain markets. The Medicare Health Plans MBR decreased by 130 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017, primarily resulting from our 2018 bid positioning and the favorable result of continued performance in clinical and pharmacy execution. 2017 vs. 2016 63 Table of Contents Medicare Health Plans premium revenue increased by $1.4 billion , or 37.2% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 , primarily driven by our acquisition of Universal American, our 2017 bid strategy and organic growth. Medicare Health Plans medical benefits expense increased $1.3 billion , or 39.6% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 , primarily due to increased membership acquired from the acquisition of Universal American and increased membership as a result of our 2017 bid positioning. The Medicare Health Plans MBR increased by 140 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 , primarily resulting from the acquisition of Universal American, bid considerations due to the ACA industry fee moratorium in 2017 and increased investments in quality program initiatives. Medicare PDPs We have contracted with CMS to serve as a plan sponsor offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDPs to Medicare eligible beneficiaries through our Medicare PDPs segment. The PDP benefit design generally results in our incurring a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages of a plan year and less in the latter stages of a plan year due to the members\\' share of cumulative out-of-pocket costs increasing throughout the plan year. As a result, the Medicare PDPs MBR is generally lower in the second half of the year as compared with the first half. In addition, the level and mix of members who are auto-assigned to us and those who actively choose our PDPs will affect the segment MBR pattern across periods. Medicare PDPs Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare PDPs segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 835.0 $ 913.8 $ 845.0 Medical benefits expense 604.8 753.4 622.4 ACA industry fee 18.3 16.2 Gross margin $ 211.9 $ 160.4 $ 206.4 Medicare PDPs membership 1,057,000 1,152,000 1,009,000 Medicare PDPs MBR 72.4 % 82.4 % 73.7 % 2018 vs. 2017 The Medicare PDPs premium revenue decreased $78.8 million , or 8.6% , for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017 . Medical benefits expense decreased $148.6 million , or 19.7% , for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017 . The decreases were primarily a result of our 2018 bid positioning and, related to the decrease in medical benefits, continued performance in pharmacy execution. The Medicare PDPs MBR decreased by 1,000 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2018 , compared with the same period in 2017 reflecting the effect of our 2018 bid strategy. 2017 vs. 2016 The Medicare PDPs premium revenue increased $68.8 million , or 8.1% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 . Medical benefits expense increased $131.0 million , or 21.0% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 . The increases were primarily due to the increase in membership resulting from 64 Table of Contents our 2017 bid strategy. The Medicare PDPs MBR increased by 870 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 reflecting the effect of our 2017 bid strategy. Business Trends and Inflation Health care expenditures have grown consistently for many years, and we expect overall health care costs to continue to grow in the future due to inflation, evolving medical technology, pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the U.S. population, and national interest in health and wellbeing. We use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation. Specifically, our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of health care services. Through these contracted care providers, our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services. Additionally, our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include health care cost trend. While we currently believe our strategies to mitigate health care cost inflation will continue to be successful, competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from health care providers and customers, applicable health care reform regulations, an increase in the expected rate of inflation for health care costs, or other factors may adversely affect our ability to control health care costs. 2019 Outlook The guidance below does not reflect teh recently announced North Carolina award, as discussed in \" Key Developments and Accomplishments .\" Medicaid Health Plans - We expect premium revenue (GAAP) for our Medicaid Health Plans segment to be in the range of $17.1 billion to $17.6 billion for 2019 , compared with $13.0 billion for 2018 . We expect premium revenue for our Medicaid Health Plans, excluding $130.0 million to $135.0 million in Medicaid premium taxes to be in the range of $17.0 billion to $17.5 billion for 2019 , compared with $12.6 billion reported for 2018 , excluding $126.8 million in Medicaid premium taxes and $302.2 million Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements. The Medicaid Health Plans MBR (GAAP) is expected to be in the range of 88.8% to 89.3% for 2019 , compared with 86.0% for 2018 . The Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR is expected to be in the range of 89.5% to 90.0%, compared to 88.9% reported in 2018 . These increases reflect new business mix as a result of the company expanded Medicaid contract in Florida and the acquisition of Meridian in 2018. Additionally, the GAAP Medicaid Health Plans MBR reflects the absence of Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement in 2019. Medicare Health Plans - We expect premium revenue for our Medicare Health Plans segment to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion for 2019 , compared with $6.3 billion reported for 2018 . Our Medicare Health Plans MBR is expected to be in the range of 85.0% to 85.8% for 2019 , compared with 84.7% in 2018 , reflecting our 2019 bid strategy, partially offset by continued operational execution. Medicare PDPs - We expect premium revenue for our Medicare PDPs segment to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for 2019 , compared with $835.0 million for 2018 . The premium revenue increase is due to the introduction of a new enhanced product in 2019. Medicare PDPs MBR is expected to be in the range of 82.5% to 83.5% for 2019 , compared with 72.4% for 2018 due to bid positioning for the 2019 plan year. Consolidated SG&A - Our consolidated SG&A ratio (GAAP) is not estimable as we currently are not able to project future amounts associated with Transaction and Integration costs associated with our acquisitions, as defined earlier. We expect that our consolidated Adjusted SG&A ratio for 2019 will be approximately 7.65% to 7.80%, compared with 8.3% for 2018 , resulting from improved operating leverage associated with premium revenue growth and continued synergies from our acquisitions. Income Taxes - Our consolidated effective income tax rate (GAAP) is not estimable as we currently are not able to project future amounts associated with Transaction and Integration costs associated with our acquisitions, as defined earlier. However, we expect our effective income tax rate to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the one-year moratorium of the ACA industry fee in 2019. The ACA industry fee, which was reinstated in 2018 and was nondeductible for tax purposes, had the effect of increasing our income tax rate in 2018. 65 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is affected by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us. Additionally, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent and other non-regulated companies (\"non-regulated subsidiaries\") are dependent upon dividends and management fees from our regulated subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. For a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors included in this 2018 Form 10-K. Liquidity The Company maintains liquidity at two levels: the regulated subsidiary level and the non-regulated subsidiary level. Regulated subsidiaries Our regulated subsidiaries\\' primary liquidity requirements include: payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS; SG&A costs directly incurred or paid through a management services agreement to one of our non-regulated administrative and management services subsidiaries; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. Our regulated subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by: generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; receipts of prospective subsidy payments and related final settlements from CMS to reimburse us for certain Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries. We refer collectively to the cash, cash equivalents and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as \"regulated cash and investments.\" Our regulated subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services; however, regulated cash, cash equivalents and investments can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners. Our unrestricted regulated cash, cash equivalents and investments was $4.8 billion at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , primarily due to cash and investments acquired with the Meridian acquisition, earnings from operations and contributions received from the parent and non-regulated subsidiaries, offset by $742.1 million paid to CMS in November 2018 for the 2017 Medicare Part D program plan year (see discussion in Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements below), the ACA industry fee payment remitted to the IRS in September 2018, cash on hand used to fund the acquisition of Aetna PDP membership and dividends paid to the parent and non-regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated subsidiaries. See further discussion under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions below. Parent and Non-regulated Subsidiaries Liquidity requirements at the non-regulated parent and subsidiary level generally consist of: payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, business development, rent, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated subsidiaries; capital expenditures; acquisition-related funding and transaction expenses; debt service; and federal and state tax payments. Our non-regulated parent and subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by: 66 Table of Contents management fees earned by our non-regulated administrator subsidiary under management services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; collecting federal and state tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments. Unregulated cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately $516.0 million at December 31, 2018 , a decrease of approximately $101.0 million from $617.0 million at December 31, 2017 . The decrease is primarily due to capital contributions to our regulated subsidiaries, the interest payments for our 2025 Notes and cash on hand used to fund the Meridian acquisition, partially offset by cash acquired in the Meridian acquisition and dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries. Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements Funding may be provided to certain regulated subsidiaries from our unregulated subsidiaries to cover any shortfall resulting from the amount of Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS that exceeds the prospective subsidy payments that these regulated subsidiaries receive from CMS. We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for our MA and PDP members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. A discussion of the subsidy components under Part D is included in Note 2- Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2018 Form 10-K. The benefits include the catastrophic reinsurance, premium and cost sharing for low income Part D members (\"LICS\"), for which CMS will fully reimburse these subsidies, or recoup overpaid subsidies made during the plan year, as part of its annual settlement process that typically occurs in the fourth quarter of the subsequent year. Cash Flow Activities Our cash flows are summarized as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 279.0 $ 1,050.0 $ 748.3 Net cash used in investing activities (1) (2,568.0 ) (1,736.5 ) 61.1 Net cash provided by financing activities 1,742.6 828.2 833.1 (Decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (1) $ (546.4 ) $ 141.7 $ 1,642.5 (1) Net cash used in investment activities and the increase in cash and cash equivalents have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU 2016-18, \" Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash \" effective January 1, 2018. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion. Cash Flows from Operating Activities We generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for health care services; however, cash flows related to our operations can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of premium receipts from our government partners. 2018 vs. 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities for 2018 was $279.0 million , compared with $1.1 billion for 2017 . The decrease is primarily due to the timing of Medicaid premium receivable receipts, the ACA industry fee payment made in September 2018; partially offset by the timing of the Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement payments and cash flows from operations. 67 Table of Contents 2017 vs. 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was $1.1 billion, compared with $748.3 million for 2016 . The increase is primarily due to improved operating earnings and the timing of claim payments, as well as the one-year moratorium on the ACA industry fee in 2017. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2018 vs. 2017 Net cash used in investing activities for 2018 was $2.6 billion compared with $1.7 billion for the same period in 2017 . The increase primarily due to the September 2018 acquisition of Meridian and Aetna\\'s PDP membership, partially offset by the 2017 Universal American acquisition and higher sales of investments during 2018. 2017 vs. 2016 Net cash used in investing activities for 2017 was $1.7 billion compared with cash provided by $61.1 million for the same period in 2016 . The increase primarily resulted from higher purchases of investments in 2017 to improve investment income, as well as the acquisitions of Universal American during 2017. Net cash used in investing activities for 2016 included the acquisition of Care1st Arizona. Cash flows from financing activities 2018 vs. 2017 Cash flows from financing activities are primarily affected by debt-related activity, as well as net funds received or paid for the benefit of members of our MA and PDP plans. Cash provided by financing activities for 2018 was $1.7 billion , compared with $828.2 million for the same period in 2017, primarily driven by the following: Net proceeds of approximately $ 1.3 billion from an issuance of 5,207,547 shares of our common stock, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. Net proceeds of $935.3 million resulting from debt transactions executed in 2018, including net proceeds of $739.0 million from the issuance of our 2026 Notes in August 2018 and net borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility of $196.3 million during the third quarter of 2018, both transactions are net of issuance costs. Net funds paid for the benefit of members was approximately $520.6 million for 2018, compared with net funds received of $671.6 million during 2017. These funds represent the net amounts we paid for related prescription drug benefits, described above in \" Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements\" , net of the amounts of subsidies we received from CMS in connection with the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount components of the Medicare Part D program related to the government\\'s portion of financial responsibility. The increase in funds paid in 2018 compared with the same period in 2017 is due to $742.1 million paid to CMS in November 2018 to settle the 2017 Medicare Part D program plan year, compared with $92.8 million paid in 2017 to settle the 2016 plan year, as well as the effect of our 2018 bids, resulting in lower payments received for 2018 net subsidies. 2017 vs. 2016 Cash flows from financing activities are primarily affected by debt-related activity, as well as net funds received or paid for the benefit of members of our MA and PDP plans. Cash provided by financing activities for 2017 was $828.2 million, compared with $833.1 million for the same period in 2016 , primarily driven by the following: Net funds received for the benefit of members was approximately $671.6 million for 2017 , compared with $1.0 billion during 2016 . These funds represent the net amounts of subsidies we received from CMS in connection with the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount components of the Medicare Part D program related to the government\\'s portion of financial responsibility, net of the amounts we paid for related prescription drug benefits, described above in \"Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements.\" The decrease in funds received in 2017 68 Table of Contents compared with the same period in 2016 is due to the effect of our 2017 bids, as well as the timing of pharmacy claims payments in 2016. Aggregate net proceeds of $156.1 million resulting from debt transactions executed during 2017 reflecting net proceeds of $1.2 billion received from the issuance of our 2025 Notes in March 2017, partially offset by the early redemption in full of our $900.0 million principal amount of 2020 notes in April 2017, including the $25.9 million redemption premium, and a $100.0 million repayment of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Refer to \"Capital Resources\" below for further discussion of our 2017 debt transactions. Debt-related activity for 2016 reflects $200.0 million drawn from our Revolving Credit Facility, which, along with $100.0 million in cash, was used to repay in full the $300.0 million term loan under our prior credit facility. Capital Resources Debt 5.375% Senior Notes due 2026 On August 13, 2018, we completed the offering and sale of our 2026 Notes. The aggregate net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes were $739.0 million, with the net proceeds from the offering being used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our acquisition of Meridian. The 2026 Notes will mature on August 15, 2026, and bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per annum, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2019. The 2026 Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of August 13, 2018 (the 2026 Indenture ), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The 2026 Indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries under certain circumstances to: incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions; make other restricted payments and investments; sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; create certain liens; incur restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments, and in the case of our subsidiaries, guarantee indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; and create unrestricted subsidiaries. In addition, the 2026 Indenture requires that for the Company to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets, (i) either the Company must be the surviving entity, or the surviving entity or purchaser must be a U.S. entity; (ii) the surviving entity or purchaser must assume all the obligations of the Company under the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Indenture; (iii) no default or event of default (as defined under the Indenture) exits and (iv) the surviving entity, after giving pro forma effect to the transaction, (x) may incur at least $1.00 of additional indebtedness pursuant to the fixed charge coverage ratio or (y) have a fixed charge coverage ratio that is no worse than the fixed charge coverage ratio of the Company without giving pro forma effect to the transactions. 5.25% Senior Notes due 2025 On March 22, 2017, we completed the offering and sale of our 2025 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,200.0 million, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of $1,182.2 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the $100.0 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement, and to redeem the full $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes. The remaining net proceeds from the offering of the 2025 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including organic growth and working capital. The 2025 Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of March 22, 2017 (the \"Base Indenture\"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 22, 2017 (the \"First Supplemental Indenture\" and, together with the Base 69 Table of Contents Indenture, the \"2025 Indenture\"), each between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. ( BNY Mellon ), as trustee. The 2025 Indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries under certain circumstances to: incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions; make other restricted payments and investments; sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; create certain liens; incur restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments, and in the case of our subsidiaries, guarantee indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; and create unrestricted subsidiaries. In addition, the 2025 Indenture requires that for the Company to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets: (i) either the Company must be the surviving entity, or the surviving entity or purchaser must be a U.S. entity; (ii) the surviving entity or purchaser must assume all the obligations of the Company under the 2025 Notes and the 2025 Indenture; (iii) no default or event of default (as defined under the indenture) exists; and (iv) the surviving entity, after giving pro forma effect to the transaction, (x) may incur at least $1.00 of additional indebtedness pursuant to the fixed charge coverage ratio or (y) have a fixed charge coverage ratio that is no worse than the fixed charge coverage ratio of the Company without giving pro forma effect to the transactions. 5.75% Senior Notes due 2020 In November 2013, we issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes. In June 2015, we issued an additional $300.0 million of 2020 Notes, pursuant to a reopening of such notes. Refer to Note 10 - Debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2018 Form 10-K for additional information regarding these 2020 Notes. In April 2017, we redeemed the full $900.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 2020 Notes at a redemption price of 102.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our obligations under the related base indenture, each dated as of November 14, 2013, by and among us and BNY Mellon, as trustee, were satisfied and discharged on April 7, 2017. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we incurred a one-time loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $25.9 million related to the redemption premium, the write-off of associated deferred financing costs and the write-off of the unamortized portion of associated premiums paid on the 2020 Notes. The loss on extinguishment of debt is reflected in our results of operations for 2017. Credit Agreement On July 23, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among other things, modified the terms of our senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") to (i) increase the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion and (ii) extend the maturity date under the Revolving Credit Facility from January 2021 to July 2023. Unutilized commitments under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are subject to a fee of 0.20% to 0.30% depending upon our ratio of total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), as calculated in accordance with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Revolving Credit Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as ABR Loans that are outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day; (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%; and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one-month interest period on such day plus 1%; plus (ii) the Applicable Rate. Revolving Credit Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as Eurodollar Loans that are outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Applicable Rate decreased to a range of (A) 0.375% to 1.00% per annum for ABR Loans and (B) 1.375% to 2.00% per annum for Eurodollar Loans, in each case depending on our ratio of 70 Table of Contents total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes negative and financial covenants that limit certain of our and our subsidiaries activities, including (i) restrictions on our and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; and (ii) financial covenants that require (a) the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA not to exceed a maximum and (b) a minimum interest expense and principal payment coverage ratio. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties that must be accurate in order for us to borrow under the revolving credit facility. In addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, we may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Lenders holding greater than 50% of the loans and commitments under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may elect to accelerate the maturity of the loans. In January 2016, we initially entered into the credit agreement, which at the time, had an initial aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $850.0 million. In 2017, we increased the amount available under our Credit Agreement from $850.0 million to $1.0 billion. In March 2017, we also repaid the $100.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018 , $200.0 million was outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2026 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. For additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 10 - Debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2018 Form 10-K. Shelf Registration Statement In November 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that became automatically effective covering the registration, issuance and sale of an indeterminate amount of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, senior or subordinated debt securities, depository shares, securities purchase contracts, units or warrants. We may publicly offer securities in the future at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Initiatives to Increase Our Unregulated Cash We may pursue alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash. Some of these initiatives may include, but are not limited to, obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries, provided sufficient capital in excess of regulatory requirements exists in these subsidiaries and/or accessing the debt and equity capital markets. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non-regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so. We believe that we have sufficient capital, or sufficient access to capital, including through the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions Each of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation. The minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue, a percentage of annualized health care costs, a percentage of certain liabilities, a statutory minimum, risk-based capital (\"RBC\") requirements or other financial ratios. The RBC requirements are based on guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") and have been adopted by most states. The statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries\\' minimum capital requirements could change over time. For instance, RBC requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate. In addition, regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituencies. Failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state. To the extent our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. Based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement, or net assets, for these subsidiaries that may not be transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends was approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2018 , and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 . The combined statutory capital and surplus of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries was $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . These increases were primarily the result of the Meridian acquisition, as well as organic growth in all of our lines of business. Our HMO and insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with and in excess of the minimum capital requirements as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017 . 71 Table of Contents Such statues, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment, and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. Dividend restrictions vary by state, but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to restrictions relating to statutory capital, surplus and net income for the previous year. Some states require prior approval of all dividends, regardless of amount. States may disapprove any dividend that, together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior 12 months, exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income. We received $335.6 million , $335.0 million and $241.0 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. The 2018 amount included $65.6 million not requiring prior regulatory approval, and $270.0 million paid after obtaining prior regulatory approval. Under applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2018 , the amount of dividends that may be paid through the end of 2019 by our HMO and insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities is approximately $420.7 million in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. For additional information on regulatory requirements, see Note 16 Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions to the consolidated financial statements in this 2018 Form 10-K. Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 . Payments due to period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (In millions) Operating leases $ 364.3 $ 42.4 $ 89.9 $ 80.6 $ 151.4 Purchase obligations (1) 94.1 65.7 25.8 2.6 Long-term debt (2) 2,150.0 2,150.0 Interest on debt (3) 700.6 103.3 206.6 206.6 184.1 Total $ 3,309.0 $ 211.4 $ 322.3 $ 289.8 $ 2,485.5 (1) Our purchase obligations include commitments under contracts for equipment leases and software maintenance. (2) Represents the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes and borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2018 . This amount excludes $23.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, which is reflected as a reduction to our long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. (3) Represents projected interest on the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes. These projections exclude the variable interest on the $200.0 million principal amount drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. We are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party; however, we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2018 , we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table above. 72 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition and premiums receivable, medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable, and goodwill and intangible assets, are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management\\'s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable We earn premium revenue through our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid-related and Medicare programs. Our Medicaid contracts with state agencies generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions, while our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts establish fixed, monthly premium rates per member (\"PMPM\"), which are generally determined at the beginning of each new contract renewal period; however, premiums may be adjusted by CMS and state agencies throughout the terms of the contracts in certain cases. Premium rate changes are recognized in the period the change becomes effective, when the effect of the change in the rate is reasonably estimable and collection is assured. Our contracts also have additional provisions as described in the sections below. We recognize premium revenue in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. We are generally paid by CMS and state agencies in the month in which we provide services. On a monthly basis, we bill members for any premiums for which they are responsible according to their respective plan. We record premiums earned but not received as premiums receivable and record premiums received in advance of the period of service as unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheets. Unearned premiums are recognized as revenue when we provide the related services. Member premiums are recognized as revenue in the period of service. We estimate, on an on-going basis, the amount of members\\' billings that may not be collectible, based on our evaluation of historical trends. An allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible. In addition, we routinely monitor the collectability of specific premiums receivable from CMS and state agencies, including Medicaid receivables for obstetric deliveries and newborns and net receivables for member retroactivity and reduce revenue and premiums receivable by the amount we estimate may not be collectible. Premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by CMS and state agencies. We verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program. From time to time, CMS and state agencies require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received for individuals who were subsequently determined to be ineligible for any government-sponsored program or to belong to a plan other than ours. Additionally, the verification of membership may result in additional premiums due to us from CMS and state agencies for individuals who were subsequently determined to belong to our plan for periods in which we received no premium for those members. We estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments and adjust premium revenue based on historical trends, premiums billed, the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information. We record amounts receivable in premiums receivable, net and amounts payable in other accrued expenses and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Supplemental Medicaid Premiums We earn supplemental premium payments for eligible obstetric deliveries and/or newborns for our Medicaid members in several states. We also earn supplemental Medicaid premium payments in some states for high cost drugs and other eligible services. Each state Medicaid contract specifies how and when these supplemental payments are earned and paid. We recognize supplemental premium revenue in the period we provide related services to our members. Medicaid ACA Industry Fee Reimbursement The ACA industry fee began in 2014. For 2016 and 2018, we received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all of our state Medicaid customers that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee attributable to our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes. We recognized $302.2 million and $244.9 million of reimbursement for the ACA industry fee as premium revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016, respectively. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, provided for a one-year moratorium on the ACA industry fee in 2017, and, as a result, eliminated the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners for 2017. Accordingly, we did not recognize any Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. 73 Table of Contents Medicaid Risk-Adjusted Premiums and Retroactive Rate Changes As previously discussed, Medicaid premium rate changes are recognized in the period the change becomes effective, when the effect of the change in the rate is reasonably estimable and collection is assured. In some instances, our Medicaid premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the health profile of our membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the state agency\\'s analysis of encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state\\'s Medicaid membership. The frequency of when states adjust premiums varies, but is usually done quarterly or semi-annually on a retrospective basis. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates and amounts ultimately paid or received. Medicare Risk-Adjusted Premiums CMS provides risk-adjusted payments for MA Plans and PDPs based on the demographics and health severity of enrollees. The risk-adjusted premiums we receive are based on claims and encounter data that we submit to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience, or other data, and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured, which is possible as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS, when the ultimate adjustment settlements are received from CMS or we receive notification of such settlement amounts. CMS adjusts premiums on two separate occasions on a retrospective basis. The first retrospective adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year. This initial settlement represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year. CMS then issues a final retrospective risk adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We populate our models with available risk score data on our members and base risk-adjusted premiums on risk score data from the previous year. We are not privy to risk score data for members new to our plans in the current plan year; therefore, we include assumptions regarding these members\\' risk scores. We periodically revise our estimates of risk-adjusted premiums as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS and adjust our estimates to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from CMS or we receive notification from CMS of such settlement amounts. As a result of the variability of factors that determine our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums, the actual amount of the CMS retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates and could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We record any changes in estimates in current operations as adjustments to premium revenue. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates and amounts ultimately received. The data provided to CMS to determine members\\' risk scores is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur. An audit may result in the refund of premiums to CMS. While our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund, future refunds could materially reduce premium revenue in the year in which CMS determines a refund is required and could be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Minimum Medical Expense and Risk Corridor Provisions We may be required to refund certain premium revenue to state agencies and CMS under various contractual and plan arrangements. We estimate the effect of the following arrangements on a monthly basis and reflect any adjustments to premium revenues in current operations. We report the estimated net amounts due to state agencies and CMS in other payables to government partners in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of our Medicaid contracts require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical benefits expense. To the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical benefits, we are required to refund to the state all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical benefits expense. Additionally, certain of our Medicaid contracts include other types of risk sharing arrangements (e.g., profit sharing arrangements) that require return of revenue to the state or receipt of revenue from the state, based on certain pre-tax earnings, net earnings or other results of operations-based calculations. In all arrangements, we estimate the amounts due from or to the state agencies based on the terms of our contracts with the applicable state agency and record the amounts as a change in premium. Historically, we have not experienced material differences between our recorded estimates and the subsequent state agencies settlement amounts. Our MA and PDP premiums are subject to risk sharing through the CMS Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. The risk corridor calculation compares our actual experience to the target amount of prescription drug costs, limited to costs under the 74 Table of Contents standard coverage as defined by CMS, less rebates included in our submitted plan year bid. We receive additional premium from CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% above the target amount. We refund premiums to CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% below the target amount. Based on the risk corridor provision and PDP activity-to-date, an estimated risk-sharing receivable or payable is recorded as an adjustment to premium revenue. After the close of the annual plan year, CMS performs the risk corridor calculation and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Historically, we have not experienced material differences between the subsequent CMS settlement amount and our recorded estimates. Beginning in 2014, the ACA required the establishment of a minimum medical loss ratio ( MLR ) for MA plans and Part D plans, requiring them to spend not less than 85% of premiums on medical benefits. The rules implementing the minimum MLR impose financial and other penalties for failing to achieve the minimum MLR, including requirements to refund to CMS shortfalls in amounts spent on medical benefits and termination of a plan MA contract for prolonged failure to achieve the minimum MLR. MLR is determined by adding a plan spending for clinical services, prescription drugs and other direct patient benefits, plus its total spending on quality improvement activities and dividing the total by earned premiums (after subtracting specific identified taxes and other fees). These provisions did not have a material effect on our results of operations in 2018, 2017 or 2016. A summary of other net payables to government partners is as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2018 2017 Liability to states under Medicaid risk sharing provisions $ (178.5 ) $ (142.5 ) Liability to CMS under risk corridor and other provisions (232.0 ) (179.1 ) Liability to CMS under MA/PDP minimum MLR provisions of the ACA (19.9 ) (1.2 ) Net payables to government partners (1) $ (430.4 ) $ (322.8 ) (1) The components of net payables to government partners are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as $28.5 million and $458.9 million in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2018 and $44.2 million and $367.0 million in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 . Medicare Part D Subsidies For qualifying low income PDP members, CMS pays for some, or all, of the member\\'s monthly premium. We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for our MA and PDP members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. Approximately nine to ten months subsequent to the end of the plan year, or later in the case of the coverage gap discount subsidy, a settlement payment is made between CMS and our plans based on the difference between the prospective payments and actual claims experience. The subsidy components under Part D are described below. Low-Income Cost Sharing Subsidy (\"LICS\") - For qualifying low income members, CMS reimburses us for all or a portion of the low income member\\'s deductible, coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold. Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy - CMS reimburses plans for 80% of the drug costs after a member reaches his or her out-of-pocket catastrophic threshold through a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. Coverage Gap Discount Subsidy (\"CGDS\") - CMS provides monthly prospective payments for pharmaceutical manufacturer discounts made available to members. Catastrophic reinsurance subsidies and the LICS represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. We are fully reimbursed by CMS for costs incurred for these contract elements and, accordingly, there is no insurance risk to us. Therefore, amounts received for these subsidies are not considered premium revenue, and are reported, net of the subsidy benefits paid, as Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. The receipts and payments between us and CMS are presented on a net basis as financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows because we are essentially administering and paying the benefit subsidies on behalf of CMS. Historically, the settlement payments between us and CMS have not been materially different from our estimates. CGDS advance payments are recorded within Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are set up for manufacturer-invoiced amounts. Manufacturer payments reduce the receivable as payments 75 Table of Contents are received. After the end of the contract year, during the Medicare Part D Payment reconciliation process for the CGD, CMS will perform a cost-based reconciliation to ensure the Medicare Part D sponsor is paid for gap discounts advanced at the point of sale, based on accepted prescription drug event data. Funds payable for the benefit of members, net consisted of the following (in millions): As of December 31, 2018 2017 Low-income cost sharing subsidy $ 97.7 $ (47.7 ) Catastrophic reinsurance subsidy (583.2 ) (987.1 ) Coverage gap discount subsidy (20.5 ) (13.6 ) Funds payable for the benefit of members, net (1) $ (506.0 ) $ (1,048.4 ) (1) The components of net funds payable for the benefit of members, net are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as $187.3 million and $693.3 million in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, and as $27.5 million and $1.1 billion in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable We recognize the cost of medical benefits in the period in which services are provided, including an estimate of the cost of medical benefits incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"). Medical benefits expense includes direct medical expenses and certain medically-related administrative costs. Direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals, physicians, pharmacy benefit managers and providers of ancillary services. Recorded direct medical expenses are reduced by the amount of pharmacy rebates earned, which are estimated based on historical utilization of specific pharmaceuticals, current utilization and contract terms. Pharmacy rebates earned but not yet received from pharmaceutical manufacturers are included in pharmacy rebates receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Direct medical expenses may also include reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers. In these instances, we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons. Based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us, such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant. Also included in direct medical expense are our estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms, out-of-network reimbursement, claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk-sharing and/or value-based arrangements. Consistent with the criteria specified and defined in guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") for costs that qualify to be reported as medical benefits under the minimum MLR provision of the ACA, we record certain medically-related administrative costs such as preventive health and wellness, care management, and other quality improvement costs, as medical benefits expense. All other medically-related administrative costs, such as utilization review services, network and provider credentialing and claims handling costs, are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense. 76 Table of Contents Medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR. Our estimate of IBNR is the most significant estimate included in our consolidated financial statements. We determine our best estimate of the base liability for IBNR utilizing consistent standard actuarial methodologies based upon key assumptions, which vary by business segment. Our assumptions include current payment experience, trend factors and completion factors. Trend factors in our standard actuarial methodologies include contractual requirements, historic utilization trends, the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, denied claims activity, disputed claims activity, benefit changes, expected health care cost inflation, seasonality patterns, maturity of lines of business, changes in membership and other factors. The following table provides a detail of the components of medical benefits payable: December 31, 2018 % of Total December 31, 2017 % of Total (In millions) IBNR $ 2,029.8 70% $ 1,412.3 66% Other medical benefits payable 867.6 30% 734.0 34% Total medical benefits payable $ 2,897.4 100% $ 2,146.3 100% The factors and assumptions that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us. The ultimate claims payment amounts, patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset since we, the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies, discussed above, would allow for this inherent variability. This can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid. Conversely, during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature, we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience. With more reliable data, we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts; therefore, we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid. In developing our estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For the more recent months, which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable, we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee PMPM costs for prior months, which costs have been estimated using completion factors in order to estimate the PMPM costs for the most recent months. We validate our estimates of the most recent PMPM costs by comparing the most recent months\\' utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments, including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims. Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. Therefore, we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever-changing mix, needs and size of our membership. External factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may affect medical cost trends. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing changes may affect our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. We believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of December 31, 2018 is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date; however, actual payments may differ from established estimates. If the completion factors we used in estimating our IBNR for the year ended December 31, 2018 were decreased by 1%, our medical benefits expense would increase by approximately $ 229.7 million . If the completion factors were increased by 1%, our medical benefits expense would decrease by approximately $ 224.4 million . 77 Table of Contents After determining an estimate of the base liability for IBNR, we make an additional estimate, also using standard actuarial techniques, to account for adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than the estimated base reserve. We refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions. Our estimate of the provision for moderately adverse conditions captures the potential adverse development from factors such as: our entry into new geographical markets; our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind and disabled; variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical costs, including higher drug costs; changes in provider reimbursement arrangements; variations in claims processing speed and patterns, claims payment and the severity of claims; and health epidemics or outbreaks of disease such as the flu or enterovirus. We evaluate our estimates of medical benefits payable as we obtain more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time. We record differences between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability, which we refer to as favorable and unfavorable prior year reserve developments, as increases or decreases to medical benefits expense in the period we identify the differences. The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our consolidated medical benefits payable: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Balances as of beginning of period $ 2,146.3 $ 1,690.5 $ 1,536.0 Acquisitions (divestitures) 534.3 128.1 37.3 Medical benefits incurred related to: Current year (1) 17,603.4 15,112.4 12,374.1 Prior year (475.3 ) (367.6 ) (284.7 ) Total 17,128.1 14,744.8 12,089.4 Medical benefits paid related to: Current year (15,486.3 ) (13,355.9 ) (10,925.0 ) Prior year (1,425.0 ) (1,061.2 ) (1,047.2 ) Total (16,911.3 ) (14,417.1 ) (11,972.2 ) Balances as of end of year $ 2,897.4 $ 2,146.3 $ 1,690.5 (1) Incurred amounts for 2018 and 2017 include a premium deficiency reserve for our Illinois Medicaid programs (\"Illinois PDR\"), which amounted to $16.1 million and $45.6 million , respectively, as discussed further in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2018 Form 10-K. Medical benefits payable recorded developed favorably by approximately $475.3 million , $367.6 million and $284.7 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions included in our prior year estimates was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year. Accordingly, the favorable development in our estimate of medical benefits payable related to claims incurred in prior years does not directly correspond to a decrease in medical benefits expense recognized during the period in which the favorable development is recognized. 78 Table of Contents Excluding the prior year development related to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, our estimates of consolidated medical benefits expense recorded developed favorably by approximately $243.8 million , $224.6 million , and $154.3 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Such amounts are net of the development relating to refunds due to government customers in connection with minimum loss ratio provisions. The net favorable development recognized in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was primarily in our Medicaid Health Plans segment and, to a lesser extent, in our Medicare Health Plans segment. The net favorable development resulted primarily from a number of operational and clinical initiatives planned and executed, that contributed to lower than expected pharmacy and medical trends, and actual claim submission time being faster than we originally assumed (i.e. our completion factors were higher than we originally assumed) in establishing our medical benefits payable in the prior years. This development does not directly correspond to an increase in our current year operating results as these reductions were offset by estimated current period medical benefits expense when we established our estimate of the current year medical benefits payable. Both completion factor and medical trend assumptions are influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations, among others. Our actual costs were ultimately less than expected. Premium Deficiency Reserves We evaluate our contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred. We establish a premium deficiency reserve (\"PDR\") when it is probable that expected future medical benefits and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums and reinsurance recoveries for the remainder of a contract period. For purposes of determining a PDR, we do not consider investment income and contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. A PDR is recorded as medical benefits expense and in medical benefits payable. Once established, a PDR is reduced over the contract period as an offset to actual losses. We re-evaluate our PDR estimates each reporting period and, if estimated future losses differ from those in the current PDR estimate, we adjust the liability through medical benefits expense, as necessary. We recorded a premium deficiency reserve for our Illinois Medicaid programs (\"Illinois PDR\") of $16.1 million and $45.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in connection with our new Medicaid managed care contract with the Illinois Department of Health Care and Family Services (\"HFS\") that was effective on January 1, 2018 (the \"Illinois PDR\"). The Illinois PDR reflects the initial premium rate structure, estimated medical benefits and other costs expected to be incurred during the initial four-year contractual term of the contract. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions typically result in goodwill, which represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units, which we determined to be the same as our operating segments. Goodwill recorded at December 31, 2018 was $2.2 billion compared with $660.7 million at December 31, 2017 . Goodwill attributable to our Medicaid reporting unit was $274.7 million and $274.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Goodwill attributable to our MA reporting unit was $392.3 million and $386.0 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Additionally, we recorded $1.6 billion attributed to the Meridian acquisition that has not been assigned to a reporting unit as of December 31, 2018. The increases in goodwill for the various reporting unit from December 31, 2017 primarily resulted from our acquisition Meridian during 2018. Refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions , included in the consolidated financial statements in this 2018 Form 10-K for additional discussion. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it would be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Such events or circumstances could include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, among others. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we compare an estimate of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the applicable goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test based on our financial position and results of operations as of June 30 of each year, which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting and planning process. The annual impairment tests are based on an evaluation of estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimated discounted cash flows are based on the best information available to us at the time, including supportable assumptions and projections we believe are reasonable. Our discounted cash flow estimates use discount rates that correspond to a weighted-average cost of 79 Table of Contents capital consistent with a market-participant view. The discount rates are consistent with those used for investment decisions and take into account the operating plans and strategies of our operating segments. Certain other key assumptions utilized, including changes in membership, premium, health care costs, operating expenses, fees, assessments and taxes and effective tax rates, are based on estimates consistent with those utilized in our annual budgeting and planning process that we believe are reasonable. However, if we do not achieve the results reflected in the assumptions and estimates, our goodwill impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, and we may impair a portion of our goodwill, which would adversely affect our operating results in the period of impairment. Impairments, if any, would be classified as an operating expense. Based on the results of our annual impairment testing in 2018 , we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and no further goodwill impairment assessment was necessary. Other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions include provider networks, broker networks, trademarks, state contracts, non-compete agreements, licenses and permits. We amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to 15 years. These assets are allocated to reporting units for impairment testing purposes. We review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur, which may potentially affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the remaining balances of our intangible assets. Such events and changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership, state funding, federal and state government contracts and provider networks. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If these assets are determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , no events or circumstances have occurred, which may potentially affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the remaining balances of our other intangible assets. Accordingly, there were no impairment losses recognized during these periods.
